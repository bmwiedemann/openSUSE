- dropped 9cdde97863825e4fdce449920d39b25414b2b0b3.patch merged upsteam
- dropped 61ce73273b3290083c01e6a2fadfb3db0889b9ba.patch merged upstream
- bump version to 20201029 (stable)
- General changes:
  - Significant refactoring of the core LAMMPS code to increase
    code reuse, simplify new additions, improve thread safety, and
    benefit from C++11 features. In particular the following
    changes were incorporated:
    - Refactoring of the AtomVec classes to simplify adding new
      atom styles to the code. Also adding support for writing
      complete data files for atom styles ellipsoid, line, tri,
      and body, which had been previously missing.
    - Implementation of string tokenizer and potential file reader
      classes to improve parsing of text files and avoid the
      strtok() function. This has lead to substantial reduction in
      the lines of code used for those cases.
    - Transferring of utility function from class members to
      standalone functions in the utils namespace. Several new
additions of such convenience functions
    - Using const std::string & instead char * or const char * as
      function argument in many places to simplify string
      processing and replacing C style string functions with their
      equivalent or expanded functionality of std::string member
      functions
    - Incorporation of fmtlib to replace and simplify many cases
      of output formatting. This avoids many complications with
      printf() style functions since no special treatment is
      required for processing bigint or tagint arguments. Since
      fmtlib has been accepted as a C++20 feature, this is also
      future proofing the code base.
    - Avoiding use of temporary local buffers for output
      formatting and thus lowering the risk of buffer overflows.
      This was enabled by the previous two changed.
    - Replacing NULL with nullptr where applicable for better
      detection of incorrect use.
  - Major reorganization and significant expansion of the manual:
    - The manual is now split into two parts: a User Guide and a
      Programmer Guide
    - Most of the content related to using the library interfaces,
      the Python module (and Python in general) have been moved to
      the Programmer Guide
    - The content of the external Developer Guide PDF has been
      incorporated into the Programmer Guide section and expanded
    - The documentation of the C-library interface and Python
      module has been expanded and the documentation of the
      individual APIs are now imported from the source code by
      means of using doxygen (for C/C++) and docstrings (for
      Python).
    - Redundancies have been reduced, cross-links added, and links
      to external websites checked, updated or removed.
  - Addition of a unit test facility which is integrated into
    building LAMMPS with CMake and using the ctest tool that comes
    with CMake. Tests for a variety of features and styles are
    included with a code coverage close to 40%. The added tests
    have exposed a significant number of previously unknown bugs
    and inconsistencies (e.g. between plain pair styles and
    suffixed versions or between Pair::compute() and
    Pair::single()) in the code base, which have been fixed.
  - Significant refactoring of the LAMMPS C-library interface and
    Python module: several new functions were added, especially
    for introspection, ad-hoc numerical constants were replaced by
    symbolic constants defined in enumerators and synchronized
    betwee C and Python, where possible and needed. Most
     modifications were
    done in a backward compatible way.
  - Add support for a "UNITS:" metadata tag to potential and
    tabulation files and code to error out if the value does not
    match with the current setting. For some potentials, mainly
    manybody potentials, support for on-the-fly conversion between
    "metal" and "real" units was added, so that a file with
    parameters for "metal" units can be used in a simulation with
    "real" units, if the pair style supports it.
  - Ordering of #include "" statements has been revised and the
    lists updated where possible after analyzing with the IWYU
    tool.
  - Significant refactoring of CMake scripts enabled by moving the
    minimum required CMake version from 2.8.x to 3.10.x. CMake
    build support is more reliable, portable to different host
    operating systems and efficient.
  - Conventional build system now always builds the LAMMPS library
    and the executable, so the available modes are reduced from 4
    to 2: mode=static and mode=shared. The CMake build behaves
    equivalently.
  - Use pre-processor macros (requiring C++11) to provide
    compatibility with OpenMP 4.x and later semantics
  - Many small fixes and improvements.
  - Removal of outdated or obsolete makefiles. Removal of obsolete
    files and folder in the bench folder.
- Updates and new commands or styles or packages:
  - New MLIAP package providing a generalized framework for
    machine-learning potentials. This currently includes an
    implementation of the SNAP potential
  - New USER-MESONT package for mesoscale modeling of nanotubes.
  - New command reset_mol_ids
  - New fix widom for modeling Widom insertions
  - New fix pafi to perform langevin or brownian dynamics time
    integration constrained to a potential hyperplane. Intended to
    be coupled to the PAFI C++ code.
  - Bugfixes, improved documentation, and new functionality for
    fix bond/react in particular RMSD based constraints.
  - New fix accelerate/cos and compute viscosity/cos in USER-MISC
    as yet another method to compute viscosity.
  - New fix momentum/chunk to remove per chunk momentum
  - New bond style special to provide a mechanism to implement
    special bond exclusions beyond 1-4.
  - Ports of more functionality to the KOKKOS package and several
    performance optimizations. Support for AMD GPUs via HIP.
    Update of the bundled Kokkos library to version 3.2.
  - Support for triclinic cells when using "tiled" communication
    style.
  - New pair style for charge-dipole damping with Tang-Toennies
    function in the USER-DRUDE package
  - Updates, bugfixes and adjustments to LAMMPS requiring C++11 in
    the USER-COLVARS package (now at version 2020-09-17).
  - Support for building triclinic neighbor lists on the GPU in
    the GPU package. Bugfixes and performance improvements for GPU
    styles.
  - Updates to writing binary dump files and binary2atom tool to
    become consistent with current text mode custom dumps
  - Updates to the user supported examples/COUPLE/fortran and
    examples/COUPLE/fortran2 wrappers to become compatible with
    updates to the C-library interface. Also work on a new,
    "object oriented" Fortran interface has started.
  - New LAMMPS shell command as alternative to the regular LAMMPS
    executable for improved interactive use.
  - Interface file for use with SWIG to create bindings to the
    LAMMPS library interface for a wide variety of (mostly
    scripted) programming languages (like Java, JavaScript, Lua,
    Perl, Ruby, Tcl and more).
  - Improved support for cross-compiling binaries for Windows on
    Linux. This enables building a liblammps.dll file and loading
    the LAMMPS Python module also on Windows.
  - Improved CMake support for building with "ninja" instead of
    "make".
