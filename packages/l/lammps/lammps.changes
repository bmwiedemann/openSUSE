  * due to changes in the random number generator initialization, results when using fix pour, fix deposit, fix evaporate or create_atoms random will not match with previous versions of LAMMPS. see PR #1569
  * the gjf keyword for fix langevin no longer supports the option yes. Instead you have to use either vhalf or vfull
  * the FIRE minimizer has been replaced with an improved implementation. The previous implementation is available as fire/old.
