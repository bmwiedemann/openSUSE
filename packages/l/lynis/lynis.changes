Thu Jun 18 12:17:36 UTC 2020 - Robert Frohl <rfrohl@suse.com>

- Update to 3.0.0 
  * Security issues
    - CVE-2020-13882: incorrect Access Control because of a TOCTOU race condition (boo#1173141).
    - CVE-2019-13033: local disclosure of license key when data is uploaded (boo#1173142).
  * Breaking change: Non-interactive by default
    - Lynis now runs non-interactive by default, to be more in line with the Unix
      philosophy. So the previously used '--quick' option is now default, and the tool
      will only wait when using the '--wait' option.
  * Breaking change: Deprecated options
    - Option: -c
    - Option: --check-update/--info
    - Option: --dump-options
    - Option: --license-key
  * Breaking change: Profile options
    - The format of all profile options are converted (from key:value to key=value).
      You may have to update the changes you made in your custom.prf.
  * Security
    - An important focus area for this release is on security. We added several
      measures to further tighten any possible misuse.
  * New: DevOps, Forensics, and pentesting mode
    - This release adds initial support to allow defining a specialized type of audit
      Using the relevant options, the scan will change base on the intended goal.
