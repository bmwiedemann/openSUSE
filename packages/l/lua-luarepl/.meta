  <title>A Lua REPL implemented in Lua for embedding in other programs</title>
  <description>This project has two uses:
- An alternative to the standalone interpreter included with Lua, one that
supports things like plugins, tab completion, and automatic insertion of
return in front of expressions.
- A REPL library you may embed in your application, to provide all of the
niceties of the standalone interpreter included with Lua and then some.</description>
