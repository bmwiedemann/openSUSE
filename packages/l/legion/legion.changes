Mon Jun  4 15:04:47 UTC 2018 - nmoreychaisemartin@suse.com
- Update to legion 18.05.0
  * Legion
    - Migrated all node-local Legion reservations to use Realm fast reservations and removed no longer necessary continuations
    - Added support for mapper attached data to all Mappable types
    - Added support for assigning a block of IDs to a library in a consistent way across nodes via generate_library_task_ids and friends
  * Realm
    - Added support for "fast" reservations that have better performance characteristics for reservations local to a node
  * C API
    - Updated projection functor API to match Legion C++ API
  * Regent
    - Regent now generates disjointness constraints for affine expressions in partition accesses. E.g. p[i] and p[i+1] are now known to be disjoint at compile time as long as p is a disjoint partition
    - Support for non-trivial projection functors in index space launches such as f(p[i+1])
    - Improvements to compile time spent in various optimization passes
    - Support for parallel compilation with the flag -fjobs N
    - Miscellaneous fixes 

-------------------------------------------------------------------

    - Operation priority can now be adjust after a task/copy is launched
    - Assorted bug/memory leak fixes
    - AffineAccessors support an optional translation from "view" coordinates
        to actual coordinates in the instance being accessed
  * Regent
    - Experimental support for calling Regent tasks from C/C++
    - Support for building with CMake
    - Support for running on PowerPC
  * Bindings
    - Obsolete Lua and Terra bindings have been removed. The remaining Terra
      bindings have been renamed to Regent and now produce libregent.so

   - Added support for minimally invasive dumping of intermediate profiling data while the application is still running for long runs
  * Python
    - New Python API bindings and native support for Python processors
