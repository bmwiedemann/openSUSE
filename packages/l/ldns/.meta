  <title>A dns library</title>
  <description>The goal of ldns is to simplify DNS programming, it supports recent RFCs like
the DNSSEC documents, and allows developers to easily create software
conforming to current RFCs, and experimental software for current Internet
Drafts. A secondary benefit of using ldns is speed; ldns is written in C it
should be a lot faster than Perl.

This package holds the tools/examples from ldns.</description>
