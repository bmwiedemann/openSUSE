-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul 26 20:19:43 UTC 2016 - wbauer@tmo.at

- Update to version 2.3.0
- New features:
  * Integration of Cantor - Support for different open-source
    computer algebra systems
  * Statistics on spreadsheets and matrices
  * Export of spreadsheets and matrices to LaTeX tables
  * Interpolation of data including different splines, cosine,
    exponential, cubic Hermite (Catmull-Rom, cardinal,
    Kochanek-Bartels) and rational functions
  * Data smoothing using moving average (centered or lagged),
    percentile filter or Savitzky-Golay algorithm
  * Fourier filter (low pass, high pass, band pass, band reject)
    with ideal, Butterworth, Chebychev I+II, Legendre or
    Bessel-Thomson filter
  * Fourier transform with many window functions (Welch, Hann,
    Hamming, etc.) calculating magnitude, amplitude, power, phase,
    dB, etc. and supporting one/two sided spectrum with or without
    shift and x scaling to frequency, index or period
  * Filter and search capabilities in the drop down box for the
    selection of data sources
  * Sigmoid function as a new pre-defined fit model
  * Support for compiling on Microsoft Windows

- Performance improvements:
  * Faster generation of random values
  * Global option to enable/disable the double-buffering for faster
    painting of curves (enabled on default)

- Bug fixes:
  * Save and restore last used setting in RandomValuesDialog
  * Update axis title shape on title rotations correctly
  * Save and restore custom column widths in the spreadsheet
  * Fixed sporadic crashes during project close

- Drop upstreamed labplot-kf5-gcc5-isnan.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul 15 19:03:51 UTC 2016 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Labplot does not show up in application centers (e.g.
  gnome-software) as appstream-builder expects the .appdata.xml
  file and .desktop file to have matching names; rename .desktop
  file to org.kde.labplot2.desktop as referenced in the
  appdata.xml file, and rename appdata.xml file accordingly.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun May  8 10:58:41 UTC 2016 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Add labplot-kf5-gcc5-isnan.patch: Replace isnan by std::isnan
  to fix building with gcc5.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May  4 05:06:30 UTC 2016 - mailaender@opensuse.org

- Update to version 2.2.0
  * Added the DataPicker which converts input graph (images) into numbers.
  * A new custom point was implemented
  * LabPlot now acccepts now drag&drop-events
  * Rendering of the image view of the matrix recieved a speed up

- Conflict with labplot, not labplot2.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 26 12:11:14 UTC 2015 - toddrme2178@gmail.com

- Initial Frameworks 5 version.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 26 11:51:24 UTC 2015 - toddrme2178@gmail.com

- Enable HDF5 and NetCDF support.  Support for these formats is
  considered stable now.

Mon Oct 26 10:02:26 UTC 2015 - freitag@owncloud.com

- Fixing build issues by upgrading to new upstream version 2.1.0

- 2.1.0 new features:
  * New Matrix view for handling matrix data.
  * Workbook - a new container for grouping several objects of type
    Spreadsheet and/or Matrix.
  * Import of binary, image, NetCDF and HDF data into spreadsheet or
    matrix.
  * Visual HDF and NetCDF parser to view content of files and import
    data sets.
  * Preview of all supported file types in import dialog.
  * Transparently import compressed data files.
  * In xy-curve the points may not be connected by the line if there
    are NANs in-between. This behaviour is controlled by the parameter
    "skip gaps".
  * Multiplier of Pi format of the plot axis for periodical functions.
  * New operations on columns in Spreadsheet - reverse, drop values
    and mask values.
  * Formula used to generate the values in a column is stored and can
    be changed/adjusted in the formula dialog afterwards.
  * Curve filling: the area below, under, left to or right to the
    curve can be filled.
  * Support for multiple variables in "Function Values"-dialog - new
    data in the spreadsheet can be calculated out of multiple columns.

- Performance improvements:
  * Speeded up the creation of new columns during the import

- Bug fixes:
  * Fixed wrong behaviour when doing "zoom&select" in a plot and then
    deselecting the plot - it was not possible anymore to select the
    plot again on the worksheet.
