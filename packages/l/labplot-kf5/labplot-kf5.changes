- Fixing build issues by upgrading to new upstream version 2.1.0

- 2.1.0 new features:
  * New Matrix view for handling matrix data.
  * Workbook - a new container for grouping several objects of type
    Spreadsheet and/or Matrix.
  * Import of binary, image, NetCDF and HDF data into spreadsheet or
    matrix.
  * Visual HDF and NetCDF parser to view content of files and import
    data sets.
  * Preview of all supported file types in import dialog.
  * Transparently import compressed data files.
  * In xy-curve the points may not be connected by the line if there
    are NANs in-between. This behaviour is controlled by the parameter
    "skip gaps".
  * Multiplier of Pi format of the plot axis for periodical functions.
  * New operations on columns in Spreadsheet - reverse, drop values
    and mask values.
  * Formula used to generate the values in a column is stored and can
    be changed/adjusted in the formula dialog afterwards.
  * Curve filling: the area below, under, left to or right to the
    curve can be filled.
  * Support for multiple variables in "Function Values"-dialog - new
    data in the spreadsheet can be calculated out of multiple columns.

- Performance improvements:
  * Speeded up the creation of new columns during the import

- Bug fixes:
  * Fixed wrong behaviour when doing "zoom&select" in a plot and then
    deselecting the plot - it was not possible anymore to select the
    plot again on the worksheet.
