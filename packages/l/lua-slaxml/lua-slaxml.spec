%description
SLAXML is a pure-Lua SAX-like streaming XML parser. It is more
robust than many (simpler) pattern-based parsers that exist
(such as mine), properly supporting code like
<expr test="5 > 7" />, CDATA nodes, comments, namespaces, and
processing instructions.

It is currently not a truly valid XML parser, however, as
it allows certain XML that is syntactically-invalid (not
well-formed) to be parsed without reporting an error.
