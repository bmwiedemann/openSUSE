- Do not have the main package recommend the bash-completion
  sub-package, but rather have the subpackage supplement the
  combination of ldc and bash-completion.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct  7 14:51:48 UTC 2022 - Guillaume GARDET <guillaume.gardet@opensuse.org>

- Build against llvm14 for Tumbleweed since llvm15 is not
  supported yet

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May 10 07:39:30 UTC 2022 - Fabian Vogt <fvogt@suse.com>

- Use gcc-d (gdc) for bootstrapping as recommended by upstream.
  Only gdc is needed for bootstrapping instead of various older ldc
  versions, which also allows to use newer versions of LLVM
  (boo#1199054). On top of that, this allows ldc to use the shared
  runtime built with itself.
- Drop use of binutils-gold, 1.29.0 does not use it by default anymore
- Mention %so_ver in %files

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr 12 11:47:22 CEST 2022 - Chris Josten <chris+suse@netsoj.nl>

- Update to 1.29.0:
  * Frontend, druntime and Phobos are at version 2.099.1
  * Support for LLVM 13 and LLVM 14
  * New @hidden UDA (as counterpart of export).
  * Support 'raw mangles' via leading \1 in pragma(mangle) strings, 
    e.g., to access magic linker symbols on Mac.
  * New @noSanitize UDA to selectively disable sanitizer 
    instrumentation of functions.
  * WebAssembly: Larger default stack size (1 MB) and protection 
    against stack overflow overwriting global memory. 
  * LDC doesn't default to the ld.gold linker anymore. The 
    combination of LLVM 13+ and older gold linkers can apparently 
    cause problems. We recommend using LLD, e.g., via -linker=lld 
    or by setting your default /usr/bin/ld symlink; it's 
    significantly faster too.
  * -linkonce-templates is less aggressive by default now and 
    IMHO production-ready.
  * When linking manually (not via LDC) against shared druntime, it 
    is now required to link the bundled lib/ldc_rt.dso.o[bj] object 
    file into each binary. It replaces the previously 
    Windows-specific dso_windows.obj.
  * Basic compiler support for Newlib targets, i.e., triples 
    like arm-none-newlibeabi.
  * dcompute: Add support for OpenCL image I/O. 
  * Revamped and improved -ftime-trace implementation for compiler 
    profiling/tracing, now excluding LLVM-internal traces, adding 
    frontend memory tracing, source file location infos etc
  * Implement core.atomic.pause() for some architectures.
  * Bug fixes:
    * Linux: Make LTO work with LLD.
    * Capture NRVO variable by ref for stack closures.
    * -ftime-trace: JSON-escape filenames.
    * RISC-V: Use 128-bit quadruple real.
    * Linux x86/x64: Fix TLS range with static druntime and bfd/lld 
      linkers.
    * Support rdtscp in DMD-style inline assembly. 
    * Fix dynamic casts across binary boundaries (DLLs etc.).
    * Don't silently ignore invalid external tool specifications.
    * LLVM v11.1: Add missing PGO ldc-profdata tool.
    * ICE for 64-bit targets with 32-bit pointer size.
  * Breaking ABI changes:
    * extern(D): formal parameters of non-variadic functions aren't 
     reversed anymore, in line with the spec.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May 17 13:49:15 UTC 2021 - Ferdinand Thiessen <rpm@fthiessen.de>

- Update to 1.26.0:
  * Frontend, druntime and Phobos are at version 2.096.1+
    incl. new ldmd2 command-line option -gdwarf=<version>
  * Supports LLVM 6.0 - 12.0
  * LDC invocations can now be nicely profiled via --ftime-trace.
  * Struct TypeInfos are emitted into referencing object files only,
    and special TypeInfo member functions into the owning object
    file only.
  * Bug fixes:
    * TypeInfo for interface gives invalid string for name.
    * dcompute: Don’t reject CUDA versions 7.x - 8.0.0.
    * Don’t enforce the frame pointer for functions with GCC-style
      inline asm.
    * Fix some cases of insufficient alignment for arguments and
      parameters.
    * Fix a few issues with LLVM 12.
    * Add source location information for TypeInfo diagnostics
      with -betterC.
    * Keep init symbols of built-in TypeInfo classes mutable just
      like any other TypeInfo, so that e.g. synchronized() can be
      used on the implicit monitor.
    * Predefine version FreeStanding when targeting bare-metal.
    * druntime: Define rt.aaA.AA as naked pointer, no struct wrapper
    * Misc. fixes and improvements for the CMake scripts,
      incl. new defaults for LDC_INSTALL_{LTOPLUGIN,LLVM_RUNTIME_LIBS}
    * -cleanup-obj: Put object files into unique temporary directory
      by default.
    * druntime: Add missing core.atomic.atomicFetch{Add,Sub}.
    * Fix regression wrt. non-deleted temporary -run executable.
  * Breaking ABI changes:
    * extern(D): Pass non-PODs by ref to temporary.
    * -linkonce-templates comes with a new experimental template
      emission scheme and is now suited for projects consisting of
      multiple object files too.
- 1.13+ is now required for 1.26+ on 32bit

Mon Dec 28 18:33:03 UTC 2020 - Matthias Eliasson <elimat@opensuse.org>

- Update to 1.24.0:
  Big news
  * Frontend, druntime and Phobos are at version 2.094.1+, incl. new command-line options -cov=ctfe, -vtemplates=list-instances and -HC=<silent|verbose> . (#3560, #3582, #3588, #3593)
  * Support for LLVM 11. The prebuilt packages use v11.0.0; x86 packages newly include the LLVM backend for AMD GPUs. (#3546, #3586)
  * Experimental support for macOS on 64-bit ARM, thanks Guillaume! All druntime/Phobos unit tests pass. The macOS package includes prebuilt druntime/Phobos; adapt the SDK path in etc/ldc2.conf and then use -mtriple=arm64-apple-macos to cross-compile. If you know how to work around the countless linker warnings, please let us know. (dlang/druntime#3226, #3583)
  Platform support
  * Supports LLVM 6.0 - 11.0.
  Bug fixes
  * Fix potentially wrong context pointers when calling delegate literals. (#3553, #3554)
  * Fix alignment issue when casting vector rvalue to static array. (c8889a9)
  * Make sure lambdas in pragma(inline, true) functions are emitted into each referencing compilation unit. (#3570)
  * Fix -Xcc=-Wl,... by dropping support for comma-separated list of cc options. (c61b135)
  * Fix ThreadSanitizer support by not detaching main thread upon program termination. (#3572)
  * Traverse full chain of nested aggregates when resolving a nested variable. (#3556, #3558)
  Internals
  * CI: Linux AArch64 is now also tested by a Travis job, because Shippable has sadly become unreliable. (#3469)
  * Building LDC with an LDC host compiler might be somewhat faster now (requires -DLDC_LINK_MANUALLY=OFF in the CMake command-line on non-Windows hosts). (#3575)
  Known issues
  * When building LDC, old LDC 0.17.*/ltsmaster host compilers miscompile LDC ≥ 1.21, leading to potential segfaults of the built LDC. Ltsmaster can still be used to bootstrap a first compiler and then let that compiler compile itself. (#3354)
  * Buggy older ld.bfd linker versions may wrongly strip out required symbols, e.g., ModuleInfos (so that e.g. no module ctors/dtors are run). LDC defaults to ld.gold on Linux.
  * LDC does not zero the padding area of a real variable. This may lead to wrong results if the padding area is also considered. See #770. Does not apply to real members inside structs etc.

    platform libraries, e.g., when targeting bare-metal. (#3374, #3475)
  Platform support
  * Supports LLVM 6.0 - 10.0.
  Bug fixes
  * Fix regression since v1.22: shared druntime potentially overriding
    libstdc++ symbols and breaking exceptions in C++ libraries. (#3530, #3537)
  * Fix naked DMD-style asm emission for non-Mac x86 Darwin targets
    (e.g., iOS simulators). (#3478)
  * -betterC: Don't use unsupported EH for handling clean-ups. (#3479, #3482)
  * dcompute: Fix wrong address space loads and stores. Thx Rob! (#3428)
  * Fix ICE wrt. missing IR declarations for some forward-declared 
    functions. (#3496, #3503)

  * Fix PGO issues. (#3375, #3511, #3512, #3524)
  * Improve support for LLVM's ThreadSanitizer. (#3522)
  * Fix linker cmdline length limitation via response files. (#3535, #3536)
  Internals
  * Compiler performance wrt. string literals emission has been improved.
    Thx @looked-at-me! (#3490, #3492)
  * Link libstdc++ statically for libldc-jit.so of prebuilt Linux packages,
    to increase portability. (#3473, #3474)
  * Set up Visual D when using the Visual Studio CMake generator, making
    LDC compiler development on Windows a smooth out-of-the-box experience. (#3494)
  Known issues
  * When building LDC, old LDC 0.17.*/ltsmaster host compilers miscompile 
    LDC ≥ 1.21, leading to potential segfaults of the built LDC. Ltsmaster

Sun Aug  9 21:57:52 UTC 2020 - Matthias Eliasson <elimat@opensuse.org>

- Update to 1.22.0: 
  Big news
  * Frontend, druntime and Phobos are at version 2.092.1+.
    (#3413, #3416, #3429, #3434, #3452, #3467) (new)
  * AArch64: All known ABI issues have been fixed. C(++) interop should now be 
    on par with x86_64, and variadics usable with core.{vararg,stdc.stdarg}.
    (#3421)
  * Windows hosts: DMD's Visual C++ toolchain detection has been adopted. As
    that's orders of magnitude faster than the previous method involving the MS
    batch file, auto-detection has been enabled by default, so if you have a
    non-ancient Visual C++ installation, it will now be used automatically for
    linking. The environment setup has been reduced to the bare minimum
    (LIB and PATH). (#3415)
  * FreeBSD x64: CI with CirrusCI is now fully green and includes automated
    prebuilt package generation. The package depends on the llvm ports package
    and should currently work on FreeBSD 11-13. (#3453, #3464) (new)
  * Link-time overridable @weak functions are now emulated for Windows targets
    and work properly for ELF platforms. For ELF, LDC doesn't emit any COMDATs
    anymore. (#3424)
  * New ldc.gccbuiltins_{amdgcn,nvvm} for AMD GCN and NVIDIA PTX targets.
    (#3411)
  * druntime: Significant speed-up for core.math.ldexp. (#3440, #3446)
  Platform support
  * Supports LLVM 3.9 - 10.0.
  Bug fixes
  * Cross-module inlining (incl. pragma(inline, true)): Enable emission into
    multiple object files. This may have a significant impact on performance
    (incl. druntime/Phobos) when not using LTO. (#3126, #3442)
  * Android: Fix TLS initialization regression (introduced in v1.21) and
    potential alignment issues. Unfortunately, the ld.bfd linker is required
    for our custom TLS emulation scheme, unless you're willing to use a custom
    linker script. So -linker=bfd is the new default for Android targets.
    (#3462) (new)
  * Casting (static and dynamic) arrays to vectors now loads the data instead
    of splatting the first element. (#3418, #3419)
  * Fix return statements potentially accessing memory from destructed
    temporaries. (#3426)
  * Add proper support for -checkaction=halt. (#3430, #3431)
  * druntime: Include core.stdcpp.* modules. (#3103, #3158)
  * GCC-style asm: Add support for indirect input operands ("m"). (#3438)
  * FreeBSD: Fix backtraces for optimized code by switching to external
    libexecinfo. (#3108, #3453)
  * FreeBSD: Fix C math related issues (incl. CTFE math issues) by bringing
    core.stdc.{math,tgmath} up to speed. (dlang/druntime#3119)
  * Fix ICE for captured parameters not passed on the LLVM level. (#3441)
  * Convenience fixes for RISC-V and other exotic targets. (#3457, #3460) (new)
  Internals
  * When printing compile-time reals to hex strings (mangling, .di headers),
    LDC now uses LLVM instead of the host C runtime, for proper and consistent
    results. (#3410)
  * One limitation for exotic hosts wrt. C long double precision has been
    lifted. (#3414)
  * For AVR targets, the compiler now predefines AVR and emits all TLS globals 
    as regular __gshared ones. (#3420)
  * WebAssembly: New memory grow/size intrinsics. (ldc-developers/druntime#187) 
    (new)
  * New -fno-plt option to avoid PLT external calls. (#3443)
  * iOS/arm64 CI, running the debug druntime & Phobos unittests on an iPhone 
    6S. Thx Jacob for this tedious work! (#3379, #3450)
  Known issues
  * When building LDC, old LDC 0.17.*/ltsmaster host compilers miscompile LDC ≥ 
    1.21, leading to potential segfaults of the built LDC. Ltsmaster can still 
    be used to bootstrap a first compiler and then let that compiler compile

	  switches -verror-style and -HC, -HCd, -HCf. (#3333, #3399)
	- LLVM for prebuilt packages upgraded to v10.0.0. Android NDK version
	  bumped to r21. (#3307, #3387, #3398)
	- Initial support for GCC/GDC-style inline assembly syntax, besides
	  DMD-style inline asm and LDC-specific __asm, enabling to write inline
	  asm that is portable across GDC/LDC and corresponds to the GCC syntax
	  in C. See ldc-developers/druntime#171 for examples wrt. how to
	  transition from __asm to similar GCC-style asm. (#3304)
	- Inline assembly diagnostics have been extended by the D source

	  (#3389)
    - Linux: Possibility to avoid passing -fuse-ld to cc via -linker=. 
	  (#3382)
    - WebAssembly: Switch from legacy linked-list ModuleInfo registry to

Sat Apr 20 21:04:20 UTC 2019 - Matthias Eliasson <elimat@opensuse.org>

- Update to 1.15.0
  * Big news
    - Frontend, druntime and Phobos are at version 2.085.1, incl. new
	  command-line options -preview, -revert, -checkaction=context,
	  -verrors-context and -extern-std. (#3003, #3039, #3053) (new)
      + The Objective-C improvements from DMD 2.085 are not implemented
	    (#3007)
    - Support for LLVM 8.0. The prebuilt packages have been upgraded to
	  LLVM 8.0.0 and include the Khronos SPIRV-LLVM-Translator, so that
	  dcompute can now emit OpenCL too. (#3005)
    - Compiler memory requirements can now be reduced via the new -lowmem
	  switch, which enables the garbage collector for the front-end and
	  sacrifices compile times for less required memory. In some cases, the
	  overall max process memory can be reduced by more than 60%; see #2916
	  (comment) for some numbers. (#2916)
      + Note for package maintainers: this feature requires a recent D host
	    compiler (most notably, it doesn't work with ltsmaster), ideally
		LDC 1.15 itself due to important GC memory overhead improvements in
		2.085 druntime.
    - Support for generic @llvmAttr("name") parameter UDAs, incl. new
	  @restrict with C-like semantics. (#3043) (new)
    - macOS: 32-bit support was dropped in the sense of not being CI-tested
	  anymore and the prebuilt macOS package now containing x86_64 libraries
	  only. MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET for the prebuilt package has been raised
	  from 10.8 to 10.9.
    - Prebuilt packages don't depend on libtinfo and libedit anymore. 
	  (#1827, #3019)
    - x86: SSSE3 isn't required for the prebuilt packages and generated
	  optimized binaries anymore. (#3045) (new)

  * Bug fixes
    - Implicit cross-module-inlining of functions annotated with
	  pragma(inline, true) without explicit -enable-cross-module-inlining has
	  been restored. (#2552, #3014)
    - Propagate well-known length of newly allocated dynamic arrays for
	  better optimizability. (#3041, #3042) (new)

      (#2878, #2893, #2920, #2933) (new)
    - The Windows packages are now fully self-sufficient, i.e., a 
      Visual Studio/C++ Build Tools installation isn't required anymore, 
      as we now ship with MinGW-w64-based libraries, similar to DMD. Check out 
      the included README.txt for all relevant details. 
      (dlang/installer#346, #2886, Wiki: Cross-compiling with LDC)
    - Debug info improvements:
      - For GDB: printing global and imported symbols, non-member 
        and member function calls. (#2826)
      - For Visual Studio and mago: names, by-value params, nested 
        variables. (#2895, #2908, #2909, #2912)
      - Associative arrays now showing up properly (at least with mago), 
        not as opaque void* anymore. (#2869)
      - -gc now translates D names to C++ ones, e.g., to use the regular 
        Visual Studio debugger (bypassing mago) and as preparation for VS Code 
        debugging with Microsoft's C/C++ plug-in (screenshots). Thanks to 
        Oleksandr for this contribution and the AA fix! (#2869)
    - New command-line option -fvisibility=hidden to hide functions/globals 
      not marked as export (for non-Windows targets), primarily to reduce the
      size of shared libraries. Thanks to Andrey for stepping up! (#2894, #2923)
    - Dropped support for LLVM 3.7 and 3.8. (#2872)
    - LLVM for prebuilt packages upgraded to v7.0.1. (new)
    - Linux: now defaulting to ld.gold linker in general, not just with 
      -flto=thin, as buggy older ld.bfd versions may wrongly strip out required
      symbols (change with -linker). (#2870)
    - Improved support for Android/x86[_64], musl libc and FreeBSD/AArch64. 
      (#2917, ldc-developers/druntime#146) (new)
    - LDC-specific druntime: ldc.simd.inlineIR moved/renamed to ldc.llvmasm.__ir
      (with deprecated legacy alias). (#2931) (new)
    - New CMake option COMPILE_D_MODULES_SEPARATELY builds D files in the DDMD 
      frontend separately to reduce the time required to build LDC with many 
      CPU cores and/or for iterative development. (#2914)
  * Platform support
    - Supports LLVM 3.9 - 7.0.
    - Alpine linux/x64: built against Musl libc to support Docker images based on 
      the Alpine distro, requires the llvm5-libs, musl-dev, binutils-gold and gcc 
      packages to build and link D apps and the tzdata and curl-dev packages for 
      certain stdlib modules.
  * Bug fixes
    - 32-bit Android/ARM regression introduced in v1.12. (#2892)
    - Non-Windows x86_64 ABI fixes wrt. what's passed in registers, 
      relevant for C[++] interop. (#2864)
    - Some issues with beta1's newly bundled Windows libraries. (#2900, #2903)
    - Alignment of scope allocated class instances. (#2919)
    - Beta2's -fvisibility=hidden causing lots of linker errors. 
      (#2922, #2923) (new)
- Update so_version to 83
- Disable ppc64 builds (boo#1113531)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct 17 09:54:24 UTC 2018 - Guillaume GARDET <guillaume.gardet@opensuse.org>

- Update to 1.12.0:
  * Big news
    - Frontend, druntime and Phobos are at version 2.082.1. 
      (#2818, #2837, #2858, #2873) (new)
        Significant performance improvements for some transcendental
        std.math functions in single and double precision, at least 
        for x86. (dlang/phobos#6272 (comment))
    - Support for LLVM 7, which is used for the prebuilt packages. 
      Due to an LLVM 7.0.0 regression, the prebuilt x86[_64] LDC 
      binaries require a CPU with SSSE3, and so will your optimized
      binaries (unless compiling with -mattr=-ssse3). (#2850)
    - JIT compilation: new ldc.dynamic_compile.bind function with 
      interface similar to C++ std::bind, allowing to generate 
      efficient specialized versions of functions (much like 
      Easy::jit for C++). (#2726)
    - LTO now working for Win64 too; the prebuilt package includes
      the required external LLD linker and the optional LTO default
      libs. Enable as usual with -flto=<thin|full> 
      [-defaultlib=druntime-ldc-lto,phobos2-ldc-lto]. (#2774)
    - Config file: new lib-dirs array for directories to be searched 
      for libraries, incl. LLVM compiler-rt libraries. (#2790)
  * Platform support
    - Supports LLVM 3.7 - 7.0.
    - Windows: Supports Visual Studio/C++ Build Tools 2015 and 2017.
    - Alpine linux/x64: built against Musl libc to support Docker 
      images based on the Alpine distro, requires the llvm5-libs, 
      musl-dev, and gcc packages to build and link D apps and the 
      tzdata and libcurl packages for certain stdlib modules.
    - Android/ARM: This release slightly changes the way emulated TLS
      is interfaced, but is missing a patch for 32-bit ARM. See the
      wiki for instructions on patching that file manually before 
      cross-compiling the runtime libraries for 32-bit Android/ARM.
  * Bug fixes
    - Fix IR-based PGO on Windows (requires our LLVM fork). (#2539)
    - Fix C++ class construction with D new on Posix. (#2801)
    - Android: No more text relocations in Phobos zlib, required for 
      API level 23+. (#2822, #2835)
    - Declare extern const/immutable globals as IR constants. 
      (#2849, #2852)
    - Fix issue when emitting both object and textual assembly files
      at once (-output-o -output-s). (#2847)
    - Support address of struct member as key/value in AA literal.
      (#2859, #2860)
    - Fix ICE when computing addresses relative to functions/labels. 
      (#2865, #2867) (new)
    - beta2 regression wrt. cross-compiling to Android. (#2863) (new)
- Fix so_version to 82

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 27 06:56:16 UTC 2018 - guillaume.gardet@opensuse.org

- Fix so_version to 81

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug 24 10:24:47 UTC 2018 - guillaume@opensuse.org

- Update to 1.11.0:
  * Big news:
    - Frontend, druntime and Phobos are at version 2.081.2. 
      (#2752, #2772, #2776, #2791, #2815) (new)
    - Add some support for classes without TypeInfos, for 
      -betterC and/or a minimal (d)runtime. (#2765)
    - LLVM for prebuilt packages upgraded to v6.0.1. 
      The x86_64 packages feature some more LLVM targets for 
      cross-compilation (experiments): MIPS, MSP430, RISC-V 
      and WebAssembly. (#2760)
    - Rudimentary support for compiling & linking directly to 
      WebAssembly. See the dedicated Wiki page for how to get 
      started. (#2766, #2779, #2785)
    - AArch64 (64-bit ARM) now mostly working on Linux/glibc 
      and Android. Current ltsmaster is able to bootstrap v1.11, 
      which can also bootstrap itself; most tests pass. 
      (Preliminary) CI has been set up. (#2802, #2817, #2813) (new)
    - LDC on Windows now uses 80-bit compile-time reals. This allows 
      for seamless cross-compilation to other x86(_64) targets, 
      e.g., without real.min underflowing to 0 and real.max 
      overflowing to infinity. (#2752)
    - New @naked UDA in ldc.attributes & enhanced functionality 
      for @llvmAttr("<name>"). (#2773) 
  * Platform support:
    - Supports LLVM 3.7 - 6.0.
    - Windows: Supports Visual Studio/C++ Build Tools 2015 and 2017.
    - Alpine linux/x64: built against Musl libc to support Docker 
      images based on the Alpine distro, requires the llvm5-libs, 
      musl-dev, and gcc packages to build and link D apps and the 
      tzdata and libcurl packages for certain stdlib modules.
  * Bug fixes:
    - extern(C++) on Posix: Pass non-PODs indirectly by value. 
      (#2728)
    - extern(C++) on Windows/MSVC: Methods return all structs via 
      hidden sret pointer. (#2720, #1935)
    - Make GC2Stack IR optimization pass work as intended. (#2750)
    - Work around inline assembly regression with LLVM 6 on Win32. 
      The prebuilt Win32 package is now using LLVM 6.0.1 too. (#2629, #2770)
    - Fix overzealous check for multiple main() functions. (#2778) (new)
    - Fix corrupt prefix in integrated LLD's console output. (#2781) (new)
    - No context ptr for nested non-extern(D) functions. (#2808, #2809) (new)
  * Known issues:
    - LDC does not zero the padding area of a real variable. This may
      lead to wrong results if the padding area is also considered. 
      See #770. Does not apply to real members inside structs etc.
- Update bootstrap version to 0.17.6:
  * Added support for LLVM 6.0 and 7.0. (#2600, #2825)
  * Backported AArch64 fixes from master; most tests passing on 
    Linux/glibc and Android
  * Fix generation of debug info. (#2594)
  * Added support for bootstrapping on DragonFly BSD
  * Fixed missing definition in std.datetime on Solaris
  * Fixed std.datetime unittest failure. (ldc-developers/phobos#59)
  * Fixed tests for PowerPC. (#2634, #2635)
  * Improvements for MIPS.
  * Make core.stdc.stdarg.va_* functions nothrow to enable 
    compiling the 2.082 frontend. (#2821)
  * CI updates.
- Remove upstreamed patches:
  * ldc-0.17.5-add_missing_include.patch
  * ldc-0.17.5-add_support_to_LLVM6.patch
  * ldc-0.17.5-backport_pr_2315.patch
  * ldc-0.17.5-default-to-pic.patch
- Enable aarch64 since it can be boostrapped with ldc 0.17.6
- Fix x86_64 build by adding '-fPIC' to C_FLAGS of bootstrap

    - No support for Objective-C class/static methods yet. (#2670)
    - Breaking Win64 extern(D) ABI change: Pass vectors directly
      in registers, analogous to the MS vector calling convention. 
      (#2714)
    - Config file: For cross-compilation, support additional 
      sections named as regex for specific target triples, e.g.,
      "86(_64)?-.*-linux": { … };; see the comment in etc/ldc2.conf. 
      (#2718)
  * Platform support:
    - Supports LLVM 3.7 - 6.0.
    - Windows: Supports Visual Studio/C++ Build Tools 2015 and 2017.
    - Alpine linux/x64: built against Musl libc to support Docker 
      images based on the Alpine distro, requires the llvm5-libs,
