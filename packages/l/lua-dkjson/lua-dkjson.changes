- Update to 2.8:
  - Fix handling of decoding errors when Lua is compiled with
    LUA_NOCVTN2S.
- Update to 2.7:
  - Enable working with newer versions of LPeg where the
    "version" field is no longer a function.
  - Fix error messages when an encoding error happens in an
    ordered dictionary.
- Update to 2.6:
  - The decode function is no longer automatically replaced by
    the version implemented using LPeg, but an LPeg-enabled
    copy of the module has to be requested explicitly with
    the function use_lpeg. This was changed to improve the
    predictability of the code and make audits more reliable.
  - The LPeg-version of the decode function now reports
    unterminated strings, arrays and objects with the position
    where they started rather than where parsing failed which was
    usually at the end of the input string. This was already the
    behavior of the pure-Lua-implementation.
  - Fixed a bug where entries in a dictionary were not put in the
    desired order when their value was the boolean false.

  with this package.
