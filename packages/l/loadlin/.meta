  <title>Linux Loader with Command Line from DOS</title>
  <description>This is a boot loader for Linux that runs under MS-DOS. It can boot
Linux from a DOS prompt or CONFIG.SYS and fully supports the command
line feature of the Linux kernel. This new version also supports
bzImage+initrd--it can load directly 'high' and can load the RAM disk.
bzImage+initrd (since 1.3.73 in the official kernel) was jointly
developed by Werner Almesberger (LILO) and Hans Lermen (LOADLIN).</description>
