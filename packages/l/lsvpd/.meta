  <title>VPD Hardware Inventory Utilities for Linux</title>
  <description>The lsvpd package contains both the lsvpd, lscfg and lsmcode commands.
These commands, along with a boot-time scanning script called
update-device-tree, constitute a simple hardware inventory system. The
lsvpd command provides Vital Product Data (VPD) about hardware
components to higher-level serviceability tools. The lscfg command
provides a more human-readable format of the VPD, as well as some
system-specific information.  lsmcode lists microcode and firmware
levels.</description>
