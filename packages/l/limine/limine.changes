-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb 23 14:21:35 UTC 2026 - Marvin Friedrich <contact@marvinf.com>

- Update to 10.8.0:
  * Limine boot protocol: Implement base revision 5.
  * Limine boot protocol: Implement x86-64 Keep IOMMU feature.
  * Fix font autoscaling not resetting per display in multi-display
    configurations.
  * Fix undefined behaviour in memmove() due to direct pointer
    comparisons.
  * Skip GOP and VBE modes with invalid pitch values.
  * GOP: Work around firmware reporting incorrect pitch via QueryMode()
    by fetching from gop->Mode->Info after SetMode().
  * GOP: Ensure SetMode() is called at least once per handle to work
    around firmware not initialising state without that.
  * Fall back to EFI/BIOS console instead of panicking on small
    terminals.
  * Disable Intel VT-d and AMD-Vi IOMMUs before kernel entry by default
    for the Limine, multiboot1, and multiboot2 protocols.
  * Try to gracefully disable x2APIC before handoff for the Limine
    (unless kernel asks for it), multiboot1, and multiboot2 protocols.
  * Replace cycle-based delay() with wall time calibrated stall().
  * Prefer physical memory allocations below 4 GiB on x86.
  * Align ACPI table memory map entries to page size where safe.
  * Undo several overzealous limits and bounds checks added in prior
    releases.
  * Updated limine-protocol subproject to latest revision.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb 10 10:48:46 UTC 2026 - Marvin Friedrich <contact@marvinf.com>

- Update to 10.7.0:
  * Multiboot2: Implement relocatable preference=2 (prefer highest
    address).
  * Multiboot2: Accept LOAD_BASE_ADDR and NETWORK info request tags.
  * Multiboot2: Accept EFI system table and image handle info requests.
  * Extensive hardening of the ELF and PE loaders with thorough bounds,
    overflow, and alignment validation.
  * Extensive hardening of the Multiboot and Multiboot2 protocol
    implementations with thorough validation of header fields, tag sizes,
    and relocation parameters.
  * Linux boot protocol: Honour kernel_alignment field from the x86 boot
    protocol header for kernel load address alignment, and init_size for
    allocation sizing. Use image_size from the kernel header for non-x86
    allocation.
  * Fix several bugs in the physical memory manager's overlap detection,
    sanitiser logic, and memory info reporting.
  * SMP: Fix x86 AP temp stack pointer to pass top of allocation instead
    of base. Fix several bugs in the AArch64 SMP trampoline and AP
    enumeration paths. Skip APs with unrecognised PSCI method instead of
    panicking.
  * Host tool: Fix signature search algorithm to correctly handle partial
    prefix overlaps. Bounds-check GPT partition entry offset arithmetic
    for overflow. Guard secondary GPT nuke against alternate_lba
    underflow.
  * ACPI: Fall back to RSDT when XSDT is above 4 GiB on 32-bit.
  * VMM: Preserve WC/FB cache attribute in x86 page table flags during
    page splits.


-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb  5 23:43:28 UTC 2026 - Marvin Friedrich <contact@marvinf.com>

- Update to 10.6.6:
  * Re-add a mistakenly removed check for EFI volume responsiveness. Lack
    of this check would indirectly cause hangs due to EFI volumes being
    indexed despite their non-responsiveness.
  * Replace suboptimal code to handle reads close to the end of a volume.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan 14 18:16:37 UTC 2026 - Marvin Friedrich <contact@marvinf.com>

- Update to 10.6.3:
  * Fix an issue with the `limine` host tool where the files read by or
    created by the `bios-install` command with the
    `--uninstall-data-file=` flag were prefixed by `=` due to an
    off-by-one error.
  * Fix an issue with the `limine` host tool where the `--quiet` and
    `--reset` flags could cause the next flag to be ignored due to an
    off-by-one error.
  * Fix an issue with the `limine` host tool that would allow a user to
    provide a GPT BIOS boot partition to the `bios-install` command that
    was 1 greater than the maximum number of partitions due to an
    off-by-one error.
  * Fix internal module path corruption in the Limine boot protocol code,
    caused by a static buffer reuse bug.
  * Add timeout for A20 address line initialisation in the keyboard
    controller code path. Lack of this could cause hangs on certain older
    "legacy-free" PCs.
  * Fix a couple of minor memory leaks.
  * Undo several overzealous "bug fixes" done since 10.5.0 for issues
    that were impossible or highly unlikely to trigger in practice.
  * Miscellaneous bug fixes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan  5 18:01:05 UTC 2026 - Marvin Friedrich <contact@marvinf.com>

- Update to 10.6.1:
  * Fix an issue where there were no bound checks when pressing the
    delete key in the menu entry editor, sometimes causing out-of-bounds
    accesses.
  * Add many checks for return values of disk-related functions that
    could fail.
  * Fix a typo in the physical memory manager code where a pointer was
    checked instead of the value it was pointing to. This could have in
    theory caused 0-length usable memory entries to appear in the memory
    map.
  * Add checks to avoid division by 0 if the user-specified baud rate is
    0.
  * Fix broken calculation in the fb_clear() function that caused severe
    out-of-bounds writes when the bits-per-pixel were not 32 or 16.
  * Fix potential unaligned memory accesses in the BLAKE2B code. This
    could have caused issues on RISC architectures like aarch64 or
    riscv64.
  * Fix missing continues in the riscv ISA string initialisation logic.
    This could have caused HARTs with invalid ISA strings to be used
    anyways instead of being ignored.
  * More minor bug fixes for bugs discovered during static analysis.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Dec 28 23:48:58 UTC 2025 - Marvin Friedrich <contact@marvinf.com>

- Update to 10.6.0:
  * ISO9660: Add support for large, multi-extent files.
  * Unbreak BIOS booting from optical media with ISO9660 filesystems on
    many platforms including QEMU. This was a regression introduced in
    10.5.1.
  * Fix an issue with large (>4GiB) physical memory allocations on 32-bit
    platforms. Some values were truncated to size_t (aka uint32_t) in
    many instances causing bugs.
  * Fix a couple of memory leaks missed in 10.5.1.
  * Add safeguard against the font file being too small for the expected
    size. This avoids potential panics from the filesystem driver, and it
    instead just prints a warning and falls back to using the default
    font.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Dec 26 14:04:13 UTC 2025 - Marvin Friedrich <contact@marvinf.com>

- Update to 10.5.1:
  * Many bug fixes throughout the codebase, mainly tackling hardening
    (especially of filesystem drivers). Most issues were caught with
    static analysis.
  * Fixage of some memory leaks.
  * Fixage of major issue that could have caused UEFI PXE to not work.
  * Multiboot1: fix issue that would cause the information buffer to be
    underallocated.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec 11 08:23:47 UTC 2025 - Marvin Friedrich <contact@marvinf.com>

- Update to 10.5.0:
  * Add new `interface_help_colour` global configuration file option to
    allow changing the colour of "helper" messages in the interface.
  * Add new `interface_rotation` global configuration option to allow
    rotating the output interface be 0, 90, 180, or 270 degrees.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Nov 30 00:58:17 UTC 2025 - Marvin Friedrich <contact@marvinf.com>

- Update to 10.4.0:
  * Add new configuration file option "global_dtb" to allow overriding
    the device tree used by Limine itself as well as for all boot entries
    (unless overridden by entry-local "dtb_path" option).
  * Flush entire I-Cache if it is not PIPT on aarch64.
  * Fix use-after-free bug in riscv64 initialisation code related to
    device tree handling.
  * Framebuffer-related caching improvements for riscv64 and aarch64.
  * Prioritise using ACPI for riscv64 initialisation code if available
    and if a DTB is not manually specified.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Nov 23 17:10:19 UTC 2025 - Marvin Friedrich <contact@marvinf.com>

- Update to 10.3.2:
  * Fix wrong virtual address related constants, for the loongarch64
    port, that made Limine-protocol kernels fail to boot.
  * Fix issue that caused the MBR ID in the Limine boot protocol
    limine_file structure to always be 0.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov  7 10:33:04 UTC 2025 - Marvin Friedrich <contact@marvinf.com>

- Update to 10.3.0:
  * Change default paths and default path ordering for configuration file
    search. Mainly, search first for a configuration file in the same
    directory as the EFI application file of Limine, on EFI ports.
  * Change default path ordering for stage 3 file search on BIOS ports.
  * No longer install the limine.h header file on the host.
  * No longer install PROTOCOL.md (Limine Boot Protocol specification) on
    the host.
  * Fix an issue where code assumed that the RSDT address in the RSDP was
    always non-NULL, which could cause crashes or hangs when using base
    revision 4 of the Limine Boot Protocol.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct 29 13:34:51 UTC 2025 - Marvin Friedrich <contact@marvinf.com>

- Update to 10.2.1:
  * Add workaround for skipping SPI flash devices exposed as EFI volumes.
    This fixes the hanging issues on many ARM laptops, without breaking
    U-Boot unlike the previous workaround.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Oct 26 21:23:37 UTC 2025 - Marvin Friedrich <contact@marvinf.com>

- Update to 10.2.0:
  * Implement base revision 4 of the Limine boot protocol as per
    documentation (read documentation for specific details).
  * "Fix" multiboot1 framebuffer structure to match GRUB instead of the
    multiboot1 specification.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 13 12:16:57 UTC 2025 - Marvin Friedrich <contact@marvinf.com>

- Update to 10.1.1:
  * Always reallocate DTBs to bootloader-reclaimable memory. This
    is to prevent pointers to EFI/reserved memory from being leaked to
    Limine protocol executables, which is against said protocol, which
    mandates that DTBs have to be in bootloader-reclaimable memory.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Oct  5 13:06:37 UTC 2025 - Marvin Friedrich <contact@marvinf.com>

- Update to 10.1.0:
  * Expand safety checks of the `limine bios-install` command and replace
    the `--force-mbr` flag with just `--force`.
  * Add autodetection of the BIOS boot partition if no explicit partition
    index is passed to `limine bios-install`.
  * Only use ASCII characters for terminal output when graphical output
    fails to initialise and the EFI standard output console is used
    instead.
  * Remove left-over logic that was meant to supplement the removed GPT
    embedding feature.
  * Remove workaround to allow building the RISC-V port with LLVM <=16.
  * Update a bunch of output messages from the `limine` host tool.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 22 09:08:35 UTC 2025 - Marvin Friedrich <contact@marvinf.com>

- Update to 10.0.1:
  * Fix a potential use-after-free issue when flushing interrupts on x86
    UEFI systems.
  * Prefer using the 32-bit Linux protocol unless it is strictly
    necessary to use the 64-bit protocol due to allocation constraints.
    This is due to reports of the 32-bit protocol being more reliable
    on certain rare systems where the 64-bit protocol crashes or hangs.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 15 20:13:38 UTC 2025 - Marvin Friedrich <contact@marvinf.com>

- Update to 10.0.0:
 * GPT embedding is no longer supported as a deployment method for
   GPT-with-BIOS configurations. The rationale for this being that it is
   far too fragile, especially with regards to growing or shrinking disk
   images, and it may cause certain machines to refuse to boot such
   setups as they are technically in violation of the GPT specification.
 * The default baud rate for serial I/O on BIOS systems is now 115200,
   instead of 9600.
 * BIOS (chainloading) boot menu entries are now hidden when booting in
   UEFI mode, and EFI (chainloading) entries are hidden when booting in
   BIOS mode.
 * For the Limine boot protocol, for relocatable executables, KASLR now
   defaults to being disabled. The rationale for this being that KASLR
   is a somewhat niche and fairly bypassable security technique, which
   can cause headaches for kernels not wanting to support it, and make
   troubleshooting harder.
 * For the Limine boot protocol, for PE format kernels, do not discard
   discardable sections, as code put to a discardable section like INIT
   might be intended to only be discarded after early kernel init, not
   before the kernel is even loaded.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Sep 13 23:18:14 UTC 2025 - Marvin Friedrich <contact@marvinf.com>

- Update to 9.6.7:
  * Relax EFI handle validation before running fallback volume detection.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 11 19:30:20 UTC 2025 - Marvin Friedrich <contact@marvinf.com>

- Update to 9.6.6:
  * Fix regression introduced by 9.6.5 that caused Limine to fail to
    boot with U-Boot.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Aug 30 16:03:54 UTC 2025 - Marvin Friedrich <contact@marvinf.com>

- Update to 9.6.5:
  * The Limine project has moved its home to Codeberg.
  * Nyu-EFI was rebranded to PicoEFI.
  * Minor build system improvements and subproject bumps.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Aug 16 11:40:33 UTC 2025 - Marvin Friedrich <contact@marvinf.com>

- Update to 9.6.1:
  * EFI chainloading: Make EFI device path of loaded image relative to
    the loaded image device handle. This now complies with the EFI
    specification, and, amongst others, it fixes chainloading Shim.
  * Miscellaneous build system changes and improvements.
  * Do not disable linker relaxations for LoongArch64.
  * `limine` host tool: Add check to ensure that a provided GPT BIOS
    partition is at least 32KiB in size.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug  5 22:41:41 UTC 2025 - Marvin Friedrich <contact@marvinf.com>

- Update to 9.5.3:
  * Miscellaneous build system fixes, mainly to sort out possible issues
    introduced by 9.5.2.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug  1 12:34:02 UTC 2025 - Marvin Friedrich <contact@marvinf.com>

- Update to 9.5.2:
  * Revert change that moved to `nm` from `objdump` for generating the
    symbol table, as that broke section-specific symbol dumps and caused
    BIOS stage 2 to be bloated with the full symbol table.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul 29 19:50:07 UTC 2025 - Marvin Friedrich <contact@marvinf.com>

- Update to 9.5.1:
  * Unbreak build using ld.gold as linker.
  * Miscellaneous build system updates and improvements.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul 15 19:10:41 UTC 2025 - Marvin Friedrich <contact@marvinf.com>

- Update to 9.5.0:
  * protocols/efi: Hybridise loading mechanism with old memory-device
    based approach. This may work around the redundant requirement that
    EFI applications be signed, and it may fix certain issues created
    when the chainload mechanism was changed in 9.0.1.
  * `limine` host tool: Fix some mismatched printf format specifiers.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul 10 16:04:05 UTC 2025 - Marvin Friedrich <contact@marvinf.com>

- Update to 9.4.0:
  * BLI: Implement `LoaderTimeInitUSec` and `LoaderTimeExecUSec`.
    These are variables used by `systemd-analyze` and are useful for boot
    performance metrics.
  * Limine boot protocol: Add bootloader performance feature.
    This feature provides the same information as the new Boot Loader
    Interface variables, but encoded in a nicer way for Limine protocol
    executables.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jun 21 09:31:44 UTC 2025 - Marvin Friedrich <contact@marvinf.com>

- Update to 9.3.4:
  * ELF: Make an optimisation related to skipping scanning of .bss
    regions for finding of structures in the loaded image (for Limine
    protocol structures or otherwise) less overeager as that could break
    in certain cases.
  * SMP: On x86, ensure that the value of IA32_APIC_BASE is the same on
    the APs as it is on the BSP.
  * PMM: Mark EfiLoader{Code,Data} regions as bootloader reclaimable
    rather than reserved memory, as for certain protocols, like the
    Limine boot protocol, reserved memory is unmapped at runtime, while
    these regions may contain hot data that is still needed, like Limine
    bootloader memory stacks.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May 27 18:16:55 UTC 2025 - Marvin Friedrich <contact@marvinf.com>

- Update to 9.3.3:
  * Reinstate the limit for scanned drives to 0xf0. This is due to a
    report of int 13h hangs when used on drives >=0xf0

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May 23 12:23:26 UTC 2025 - Marvin Friedrich <contact@marvinf.com>

- Update to 9.3.2:
  * Mark EfiBootServices{Code,Data} memory regions as bootloader
    reclaimable instead of usable free memory

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May  7 15:19:40 UTC 2025 - Marvin Friedrich <contact@marvinf.com>

- Update to 9.3.0:
  * Add optional support for the 64-bit x86-64 boot protocol for Linux.
  * Fix away some ungraceful handling of out-of-memory situations when
    loading files using the Linux boot protocol.
  * Improve performance and memory usage of loading modules for the
    Linux boot protocol.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Apr 19 13:06:44 UTC 2025 - Marvin Friedrich <contact@marvinf.com>

- Update to 9.2.3:
  * Fix issues introduced by the stb_image fix introduced in 9.2.1 which
    could cause hangs or crashes when certain wallpaper images are used.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 31 12:30:21 UTC 2025 - Marvin Friedrich <contact@marvinf.com>

- Update to 9.2.2:
  * Fixes and workarounds in order to make multiboot2 more
    resilient when booting specific kernels such as Xen.
  * Avoid mistakenly allocating more memory than necessary when
    creating the volume index.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 25 23:35:00 UTC 2025 - Marvin Friedrich <contact@marvinf.com>

- Update to 9.2.1:
  * Fix potential buffer overflow bug with stb_image support code.
  * Print the name of unresolved symbols on panic.
  * Dynamically allocate volume index instead of relying on a hard coded
    limit and a fixed allocation.
