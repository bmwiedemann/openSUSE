- Fix Windows host package dependencies and portability:
  * Add 'AutoReqProv: no' to windows-host subpackage to prevent 
    RPM from generating fake dependencies on Windows DLLs (e.g. avrt.dll).
  * Pass '-static' to CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS during MinGW cross-compilation
    to ensure the resulting executable is standalone and doesn't 
    require external MinGW runtime DLLs. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------

    using mingw64 toolchain.
  * Fixed .desktop file binary path using sed during %prep.
  * Corrected unstripped binaries (OBS plugins)
  * Fixed rpmlint error regarding unused filters.

    Windows guest executable.
    * Adjusted KMP dependencies to match new naming convention.
  * Applied fix-bfd-ctf-zstd.patch to resolve binutils compatibility
    issues on Tumbleweed.
  * Added missing %changelog in looking-glass-kvmfr 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Feb 22 03:13:39 UTC 2026 - Jonatas Gonçalves <jonatas.sgoncalves@gmail.com>

- Modernize and clean up the spec file:
  * Replace manual directory management with a unified 'build_dir' helper function.
  * Ensure consistent CFLAGS/CXXFLAGS propagation across Client, Host, and OBS Plugin.
  * Fix incorrect icon and desktop file installation paths in the %install section.
  * Add automatic stripping of unneeded symbols for binaries and OBS plugins.

Wed Feb 18 23:10:14 UTC 2026 - Jonatas Gonçalves <jonatas.sgoncalves@gmail.com>

- Cleanup BuildRequires and optimize package dependencies:
  * Remove redundant or unused BuildRequires: zlib-devel-static, zstd,
    libzstd-devel, libSDL2_ttf-2_0-0, libdecor-0-0, libctf0, clang,
    glibc-locale-base, libconfig-devel, nerd-dejavu-sansmono-fonts,
    and libavutil57.
  * Replace generic pkgconf-pkg-config with pkgconfig(fontconfig).
  * Improve OBS plugin recommendation logic using rich dependencies.
  * Move runtime dependencies (Mesa-libGL1, KMP, and OBS recommendation)
    specifically to the %package client to ensure a leaner base package.
  * Use pkgconfig(gl, egl, glesv2) for standardized dependency resolution.
  * Keep explicit Mesa-libGLESv3-devel as the GLESv3 provider is not
    available via pkgconfig in the current build environment.
