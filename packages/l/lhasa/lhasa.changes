- Update to new upstream release 0.3.1
  * This release fixes an integer underflow vulnerability in the
    code for doing LZH level 3 header decodes (TALOS-CAN-0095)
    [bnc#973790] [CVE-2016-2347]

- Update to new upstream release 0.3.0
* PMarc -pm1- archives that contain truncated compressed data (the
  decompressed length is longer than what can be read from the
  compressed data) now decompress as intended. Certain archives in
  the wild make the assumption that this can be done.
* LArc -lz5- archives that make use of the initial history buffer
  now decompress correctly.
* The tests no longer use predictable temporary paths.

- Update to new upstream release 0.2.0

  extracted beyond the first file in the archive was fixed.
* Output when using the -w (extract directory) option now correctly
  matches the output of Unix lha.
