Tue Aug 12 13:57:33 UTC 2025 - Antonio Teixeira <antonio.teixeira@suse.com>

- Update to release 0.5.0
  * The output from the list subcommands has been tweaked to be
    more consistent.
  * A workaround was added for a bug with the Amiga port of lha
    that causes some versions to generate malformed archives where
    directories are stored using the -lh0- compression type.
  * Support was added for the 64-bit file sizes header, allowing
    huge files (>=4GiB) generated by the MorphOS port of lha to be
    extracted correctly.
  * The compression ratio shown in list output now always rounds up
    to the next 0.1%.
  * The manual page now includes more detailed information about
    the different list subcommands.
  * The liblhasa headers are now installed into a directory with a
    name that accurately reflects the project's version number.
  * The liblhasa .so version numbers now have meaningful numbers.
  * Some error messages were changed to print filenames safely.
  * Extraction of DECLHA self-extracting archives was fixed.
  * Undefined behavior in the BitStreamReader code was fixed.

Sun May 14 15:45:46 UTC 2023 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 0.4.0
  * A verbose mode was added to the list output that shows the
    full file timestamp.
  * Support for archives generated by the DOS LHARK tool was
    added.

- Update to new upstream release 0.3.1
  * This release fixes an integer underflow vulnerability in the
    code for doing LZH level 3 header decodes (TALOS-CAN-0095)
    [bnc#973790] [CVE-2016-2347]

Sat Nov  7 09:38:52 UTC 2015 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 0.3.0
* PMarc -pm1- archives that contain truncated compressed data (the
  decompressed length is longer than what can be read from the
  compressed data) now decompress as intended. Certain archives in
  the wild make the assumption that this can be done.
* LArc -lz5- archives that make use of the initial history buffer
  now decompress correctly.
* The tests no longer use predictable temporary paths.

- Drop gpg-offline build-time requirement; this is now handled by
  the local source validator

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug  7 21:20:14 UTC 2013 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 0.2.0
* Decompression of archives using the -lhx- file format supported
  by unlha32.dll is now supported.
* The -p (print to stdout) command line option is now supported.
* A bug where archives read from pipes (e.g. stdin) were not
  extracted beyond the first file in the archive was fixed.
* Output when using the -w (extract directory) option now correctly
  matches the output of Unix lha.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar 28 21:28:20 UTC 2013 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 0.1.0
* This version adds better support for OS-9 lzh archives and fixes
  several security vulnerabilities related to handling of symbolic
  links.

- Update to new upstream release 0.0.7
* This release adds support for extraction of Unix symbolic links
  and parsing of Unix-level 0 extended header areas. A decompressor
  has been added for the "old" PMarc compression algorithm (-pm1-).
