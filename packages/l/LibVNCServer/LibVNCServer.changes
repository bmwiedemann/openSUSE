- version update to 0.9.13 [bsc#1173477]
  ## Overall changes:

    * Added a hooking function (`clientFramebufferUpdateRequestHook`) to deliver
          rfbFramebufferUpdateRequest messages from clients to the frame producer
          thanks to Jae Hyun Yoo.
    * Added SetDesktopSize/ExtendedDesktopSize support thanks to Floris Bos.
    * Added multi-threading support for MS Windows.
    * Fixed VNC repeater/proxy functionality that was broken in 0.9.12.

Wed Sep 26 21:08:14 UTC 2012 - p.drouand@gmail.com

- Update to 0.9.9 version:
 - Overall changes:
     * Added noVNC HTML5 VNC viewer (http://kanaka.github.com/noVNC/) connect possibility
       to our http server. Pure JavaScript, no Java plugin required anymore! (But a
       recent browser...)
     * Added a GTK+ VNC viewer example.

   - LibVNCServer/LibVNCClient:
     * Added support to build for Google Android.
     * Complete IPv6 support in both LibVNCServer and LibVNCClient.

   - LibVNCServer:
     * Split two event-loop related functions out of the rfbProcessEvents() mechanism.
       This is required to be able to do proper event loop integration with Qt. Idea was
       taken from Vino's libvncserver fork.
     * Added TightPNG (http://wiki.qemu.org/VNC_Tight_PNG) encoding support. Like the
       original Tight encoding, this still uses JPEG, but ZLIB encoded rects are encoded
       with PNG here.
     * Added suport for serving VNC sessions through WebSockets
       (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket), a web technology providing for multiplexing
       bi-directional, full-duplex communications channels over a single TCP connection.
     * Support connections from the Mac OS X built-in VNC client to LibVNCServer
       instances running with no password.
     * Replaced the Tight encoder with a TurboVNC one which is tremendously faster in most
       cases, especially with high-color video or 3D workloads.
       (http://www.virtualgl.org/pmwiki/uploads/About/tighttoturbo.pdf)

   - LibVNCClient:
     * Added support to only listen for reverse connections on a specific IP address.
     * Support for using OpenSSL instead of GnuTLS. This could come in handy on embedded
       devices where only this TLS implementation is available.
     * Added support to connect to UltraVNC Single Click servers.
