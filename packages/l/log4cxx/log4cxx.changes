  * Qt6 can be used when building with LOG4CXX_QT_SUPPORT=on
  * TelnetAppender can now deliver messages when the socket is in
    a TIME_WAIT state [#495]
  * TelnetAppender can be restricted to specific network [#498]
  * The following issues have been addressed:
  * HTML output was illformed when the logger name, title or
    thread name contained the special HTML characters
  * JSON output was illformed when a message contained certain
    control characters [#512]
  * Undefined behaviour when reloading a configuration file after
    calling LogManager::shutdown [#504]
  * Compilation error when using gcc on MacOS [#499]
  * It was possible for logging events to be lost when reloading
    a configuration file [#491]
  * Buffered file output is now periodically flushed by a
    background thread [#445]
  * The MultiprocessRollingFileAppender did not work [#439]
  * Boundary conditions not comprehensively checked when
    processing a configuration file
  * Properly prevent undefined behaviour when an appender is
    deleted without being closed [#431]
  * Prevent abnormal termination on exit when using a static
    NDC/MDC variable [#426]
  * Support for std::experimental::optional
  * Overhead reduction of upto 60% sending logging events to
    an appender
  * Statistics on the AsyncAppender's queue length
    (in Log4cxx debug output)
  * Fuzz tests along with Google OSS-Fuzz integration
  * A potential 'use after free' fault when using AsyncAppender [#397]

  * log4cxx::hexdump function that returns a string of hexadecimal
    byte values
  * Ability to remove a HierarchyEventListener [#233]
  * Less string copying when sending a logging event to an appender
  * Less frequent mutex contention when logging from multiple
    threads concurrently [#320]
  * Allow thread information to be included in JSON formatted output
  * Optional support for logging during process termination [#271]
  * A cmake option to place Log4cxx functions in a different
    namespace [#277]

Sat Dec 30 20:59:08 UTC 2023 - Dirk M端ller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.1.0 (bsc#1211173, CVE-2023-31038):
  * Fix CVE-2023-31038
  * Fix to build on Windows Server 2016
  * Fix compiling errors with older compilers
  * Make ODBC and SMTP opt-in instead of automatic
  * Parameterize statements for ODBC inserts. Add new generic
    DBAppender class that uses APR for database support
  * Fix Qt support
- update to 1.0.0:
  * This is a major release that fixes a number of long-standing
    issues and is desinged to make Log4cxx ABI stable moving
    forward.
  * Removed log4j style Java serialization. Due to Java's inherent
    problems with serialization, and the fact that Chainsaw no
    longer supports it, it has been completely removed.
  * A number of obsolete classes have been removed
  * Removal of TTCCLayout. If you still want this layout, use a
    PatternLayout with a format similar to the following: %r [%t] %-5p
    - %m%n
  * Removal of DateLayout. Use PatternLayout instead.
  * Classes now use an internal private class to store member
    variables in order to make them ABI stable
  * Multiprocess support is available, but Log4cxx must be
    explicitly compiled with this option
- implement gpg validation
