-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec 15 02:06:55 UTC 2021 - Simon Lees <sflees@suse.de>

- Update to 2.16.0 [bsc#1193743, CVE-2021-45046]
  * Features
    - Add JsonTemplateLayout.
    - Create module log4j-mongodb4 to use new major version 4
      MongoDB driver.
    - More flexible configuration of the Disruptor WaitStrategy.
      Thanks to Stepan Gorban.
  * Bugfixes and minor enhancements
    - It was found that the fix to address CVE-2021-44228 in Apache 
      Log4j 2.15.0 was incomplete in certain non-default
      configurations.
      This could allows attackers with control over Thread Context
      Map (MDC) input data when the logging configuration uses a
      Pattern Layout with either a Context Lookup (for example,
      $${ctx:loginId}) or a Thread Context Map pattern (%X, %mdc, or
      %MDC) to craft malicious input data using a JNDI Lookup
      pattern resulting in a denial of service (DOS) attack.
      Log4j 2.15.0 restricts JNDI LDAP lookups to localhost by
      default. Note that previous mitigations involving
      configuration such as setting the system property
      log4j2.noFormatMsgLookup to true do NOT mitigate this specific
      vulnerability.
    - Upstream initial fix for bsc#1193611, CVE-2021-44228
    - Numerous other minor bugfixes 
  * Drop CVE-2021-44228.patch and disable-jndi-by-default.patch
    included upstream
  * To make the bots happy this stream isn't affected by
    bsc#1193662 CVE-2021-4104 which is 1.X only

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec 14 17:43:26 UTC 2021 - Peter Simons <psimons@suse.com>

- Apply "disable-jndi-by-default.patch" to disable JNDI support by
  default. There is evidence that the previous upstream fix for
  CVE-2021-44228 did not solve the vulnerability entirely. Since
  JNDI support is ususally not required, upstream recommends this
  route to be completely safe. [bsc#1193611, CVE-2021-44228]

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Dec 10 14:03:24 UTC 2021 - Peter Simons <psimons@suse.com>

- Apply "CVE-2021-44228.patch" to fix a remote code execution
  vulnerability that existed in the LDAP JNDI parser. [bsc#1193611,
  CVE-2021-44228]

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr 27 14:57:36 UTC 2020 - Fridrich Strba <fstrba@suse.com>

Tue Jan 21 10:55:28 UTC 2020 - Pedro Monreal Gonzalez <pmonrealgonzalez@suse.com>

- Update to 2.13.0 [bsc#1159646, CVE-2019-17571]
  * Bugfixes and minor enhancements:
    - CVE-2019-17571: Remote code execution: Deserialization of untrusted
      data in SocketServer
    - Log4j 2 now requires Java 8 or higher to build and run.
    - Better integration with Spring Boot by providing access to Spring
      variables in Log4j 2 configuration files and allowing Log4j 2 system
      properties to be defined in the Spring configuration.
    - Support for accessing Kubernetes information via a Log4j 2 Lookup.
    - The Gelf Layout now allows the message to be formatted using a
      PatternLayout pattern.
    - Due to a break in compatibility in the SLF4J binding, Log4j now
      ships with two versions of the SLF4J to Log4j adapters.
    - log4j-slf4j-impl should be used with SLF4J 1.7.x and earlier and
      log4j-slf4j18-impl should be used with SLF4J 1.8.x and later.
    - Note that the XML, JSON and YAML formats changed in the 2.11.0 release:
      they no longer have the "timeMillis" attribute and instead have an
      "Instant" element with "epochSecond" and "nanoOfSecond" attributes.
    - The Log4j 2.13.0 API, as well as many core components, maintains
      binary compatibility with previous releases.
  * New Features
    - Add ThreadContext.putIfNotNull method.
    - Add a Level Patttern Selector.
    - Add experimental support for Log4j 1 configuration files.
    - Add the ability to lookup Kubernetes attributes in the Log4j
      configuration. Allow Log4j properties to be retrieved from the
      Spring environment if it is available.
    - Allow Spring Boot application properties to be accessed in the
      Log4j 2 configuration. Add lower and upper case Lookups.
    - Add builder pattern to Logger interface.
  * Fixed Bugs
    - Prevent recursive calls to java.util.LogManager.getLogger().
    - Added try/finally around event.execute() for RingBufferLogEventHandler
      to clear memory correctly in case of exception/error.
    - Wrong java version check in ThreadNameCachingStrategy.
    - Use a less confusing name for the CompositeConfiguration source.
    - Add setKey method to Kafka Appender Builder.
    - ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException could occur with MAC address longer
      than 6 bytes.
    - The rolling file appenders would fail to compress the file after
      rollover if the file name matched the file pattern.
    - @PluginValue does not support attribute names besides "value".
    - Validation blocks definition of script in properties configuration.
    - Set result of rename action to true if file was copied.
    - Add automatic module names where missing.
    - OutputStreamAppender.Builder ignores setFilter().
    - Prevent a memory leak when async loggers throw errors.
  * Changes
    - Update Jackson to 2.9.10.
    - Allow message portion of GELF layout to be formatted using a PatternLayout.
    - Allow ThreadContext attributes to be explicitly included or excluded in the GelfLayout.
