- Update to version 0.5.3:
  * This is just a quick fix of the xlib-display-server and leftwm crates
    to get them back to building for 32-bit systems.
- Changes since 0.5.2:
  * New window rule options, window_hiding_strategy, default_height and default_width were introduced.
  * X11RB server backend has been added.
  * Directional focus for window switching!
  * Scratchpads can now be called with arguments!
  * Window history is now cleaned up, which should fix focusing issues!
  * LeftWM is back to building on MSRV and later Rust Versions.
  * Hidden windows can now be captured by screen recorders, if needed!
  * 32 bit builds are working again.
  * Visible and busy workspaces no longer come together for downstream programs.
  * The currently supported MSRV is 1.74.0

- Update to version 0.5.1:
  * The layouts and workspace.layouts in config.ron must be declared as
  Strings because they are no longer backed by an enum. (ie. use layouts:
  ["CenterMain"] instead of layouts: [CenterMain])
  * The max_window_width config was removed without direct replacement. The
  "always fill entire screen" behavior can now be addressed by creating a
  custom layout with an appropriate Reserve property.
  * LeftWM now depends on lefthk ^0.2.0, which has been refactored
  * Dialog windows correctly obey their spawned sized
  * Fixes to location of spawned windows
  * Fixes to full-screened windows
  * Maximized windows no longer hide the dock
  * Fixes to ordering of windows after exiting from full screen mode
  * Basic theme and documentation fixes
  * Improved performance for set_layout , event_loop, and Xscreens
  * Improved error messages for leftwm-state and leftwm-check
  * Cursors now snap to the bottom right of a window when resizing
  * The new ignore_empty and ignore_used options in FocusNext/Previous Tag
  * Command SwapWindowToTop introduced
