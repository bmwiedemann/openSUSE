- Build AVX2 enabled hwcaps library for x86_64-v3

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec 28 12:07:35 UTC 2021 - Luigi Baldoni <aloisio@gmx.com>

- Update to version 21.07
  * New switches: -spm and -im!{file_path} to exclude
    directories from processing for specified paths that don't
    contain path separator character at the end of path.
  * The sorting order of files in archives was slightly changed
    to be more consistent for cases where the name of some
    directory is the same as the prefix part of the name of
    another directory or file.

Sat Dec 11 22:04:00 UTC 2021 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update lzma-sdk-shlib.patch to use Sha256Opt.c for generating
  libclzma.so. boo#1193657

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov 29 11:37:21 UTC 2021 - Luigi Baldoni <aloisio@gmx.com>

- Update to version 21.06
  * Bug in LZMA encoder in file LzmaEnc.c was fixed:
    LzmaEnc_MemEncode(), LzmaEncode() and LzmaCompress() could
    work incorrectly, if size value for output buffer is smaller
    than size required for all compressed data. LzmaEnc_Encode()
    could work incorrectly, if callback ISeqOutStream::Write()
    doesn't write all compressed data.
    NCompress::NLzma::CEncoder::Code() could work incorrectly,
    if callback ISequentialOutStream::Write() returns error
    code.
  * Bug in versions 21.00-21.05 was fixed:
    7-Zip didn't set attributes of directories during archive
    extracting.
  version 21.04 beta:
  * 7-Zip now reduces the number of working CPU threads for
    compression, if RAM size is not enough for compression with
    big LZMA2 dictionary.
  * 7-Zip now can create and check "file.sha256" text files that
    contain the list of file names and SHA-256 checksums in
    format compatible with sha256sum program.
  version 21.03 beta:
  * The maximum dictionary size for LZMA/LZMA2 compressing was
    increased to 4 GB (3840 MiB).
  * Minor speed optimizations in LZMA/LZMA2 compressing.
  version 21.02 alpha:
  * The speed for LZMA and LZMA2 decompression in arm64 versions
    was increased by 20%-60%.
  version 21.01 alpha:
  * The improvements for speed of ARM64 version using hardware
    CPU instructions  for AES, CRC-32, SHA-1 and SHA-256.
  * Some bugs were fixed.
  version 20.02 alpha:
  * The default number of LZMA2 chunks per solid block in 7z
    archive was increased to 64. It allows to increase the
    compression speed for big 7z archives, if there is a big
    number  of CPU cores and threads.
  * The speed of PPMd compressing/decompressing was increased
    for 7z archives.
  * The new -ssp switch. If the switch -ssp is specified, 7-Zip
    doesn't allow the system  to modify "Last Access Time"
    property of source files for archiving and hashing operations. 
  * Some bugs were fixed.
  version 20.00 alpha;
  * 7-Zip now supports new optional match finders for LZMA/LZMA2
    compression: bt5 and hc5,  that can work faster than bt4 and
    hc4 match finders for the data with big redundancy.
  * The compression ratio was improved for Fast and Fastest
    compression levels with the following default settings:
    + Fastest level (-mx1) : hc5 match finder with 256 KB
      dictionary.
    + Fast level (-mx3) : hc5 match finder with 4 MB
      dictionary.
  * Minor speed optimizations in multithreaded LZMA/LZMA2
    compression for Normal/Maximum/Ultra compression levels.

Fri Feb 22 11:22:49 UTC 2019 - Luigi Baldoni <aloisio@gmx.com>

- Update to version 19.00
  * Encryption strength for 7z archives was increased:
    the size of random initialization vector was increased from
    64-bit to 128-bit, and the pseudo-random number generator was
    improved.
  * The bug in 7zIn.c code was fixed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Dec 30 10:13:52 UTC 2018 - Luigi Baldoni <aloisio@gmx.com>

- Update to version 18.06
  * The speed for LZMA/LZMA2 compressing was increased by 3-10%,
    and there are minor changes in compression ratio.
  * Some bugs were fixed.
  * The bug in 7-Zip 18.02-18.05 was fixed:
    There was memory leak in multithreading xz decoder -
    XzDecMt_Decode(), if xz stream contains only one block.
  * The changes for MSVS compiler makefiles:
    + the makefiles now use "PLATFORM" macroname with values
      (x64, x86, arm64) instead of "CPU" macroname with values
      (AMD64, ARM64).
    + the makefiles by default now use static version of the
      run-time library.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May  1 11:19:07 UTC 2018 - aloisio@gmx.com

- Update to version 18.05
  * The speed for LZMA/LZMA2 compressing was increased
    by 8% for fastest/fast compression levels and
    by 3% for normal/maximum compression levels.
  * The BUG was fixed in Lzma2Enc.c
    Lzma2Enc_Encode2() function worked incorretly,
      if (inStream == NULL) and the number of block threads is
      more than 1.

    LZMA decoder written in C.
  * The speed for single-thread LZMA/LZMA2 decoder written in C
    was increased by 3%.
