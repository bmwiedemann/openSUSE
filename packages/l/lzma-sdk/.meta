  <title>SDK for lzma compression</title>
  <description>LZMA SDK provides the documentation, samples, header files, libraries,
and tools you need to develop applications that use LZMA compression.

LZMA is default and general compression method of 7z format
in 7-Zip compression program (www.7-zip.org). LZMA provides high
compression ratio and very fast decompression.

LZMA is an improved version of famous LZ77 compression algorithm.
It was improved in way of maximum increasing of compression ratio,
keeping high decompression speed and low memory requirements for
decompressing.
