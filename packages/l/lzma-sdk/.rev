    <comment>- Update lzma-sdk-shlib.patch to use Sha256Opt.c for generating
  libclzma.so. boo#1193657
- Update to version 21.06
  * Bug in LZMA encoder in file LzmaEnc.c was fixed:
    LzmaEnc_MemEncode(), LzmaEncode() and LzmaCompress() could
    work incorrectly, if size value for output buffer is smaller
    than size required for all compressed data. LzmaEnc_Encode()
    could work incorrectly, if callback ISeqOutStream::Write()
    doesn't write all compressed data.
    NCompress::NLzma::CEncoder::Code() could work incorrectly,
    if callback ISequentialOutStream::Write() returns error
    code.
  * Bug in versions 21.00-21.05 was fixed:
    7-Zip didn't set attributes of directories during archive
    extracting.
  version 21.04 beta:
  * 7-Zip now reduces the number of working CPU threads for
    compression, if RAM size is not enough for compression with
    big LZMA2 dictionary.
  * 7-Zip now can create and check &quot;file.sha256&quot; text files that
    contain the list of file names and SHA-256 checksums in
    format compatible with sha256sum program.
  version 21.03 beta:
  * The maximum dictionary size for LZMA/LZMA2 compressing was
    increased to 4 GB (3840 MiB).
  * Minor speed optimizations in LZMA/LZMA2 compressing.
  version 21.02 alpha:
  * The speed for LZMA and LZMA2 decompression in arm64 versions
    was increased by 20%-60%.
  version 21.01 alpha:
  * The improvements for speed of ARM64 version using hardware
    CPU instructions  for AES, CRC-32, SHA-1 and SHA-256.
  * Some bugs were fixed.
  version 20.02 alpha:
  * The default number of LZMA2 chunks per solid block in 7z
    archive was increased to 64. It allows to increase the
    compression speed for big 7z archives, if there is a big
    number  of CPU cores and threads.
  * The speed of PPMd compressing/decompressing was increased
    for 7z archives.
  * The new -ssp switch. If the switch -ssp is specified, 7-Zip
    doesn't allow the system  to modify &quot;Last Access Time&quot;
    property of source files for archiving and hashing operations. 
  * Some bugs were fixed.
  version 20.00 alpha;
  * 7-Zip now supports new optional match finders for LZMA/LZMA2
    compression: bt5 and hc5,  that can work faster than bt4 and
    hc4 match finders for the data with big redundancy.
  * The compression ratio was improved for Fast and Fastest
    compression levels with the following default settings:
    + Fastest level (-mx1) : hc5 match finder with 256 KB
      dictionary.
    + Fast level (-mx3) : hc5 match finder with 4 MB
      dictionary.
  * Minor speed optimizations in multithreaded LZMA/LZMA2
    compression for Normal/Maximum/Ultra compression levels.
- Update to version 19.00
  * Encryption strength for 7z archives was increased:
    the size of random initialization vector was increased from
    64-bit to 128-bit, and the pseudo-random number generator was
    improved.
  * The bug in 7zIn.c code was fixed.
- Update to version 18.06
  * The speed for LZMA/LZMA2 compressing was increased by 3-10%,
    and there are minor changes in compression ratio.
  * Some bugs were fixed.
  * The bug in 7-Zip 18.02-18.05 was fixed:
    There was memory leak in multithreading xz decoder -
    XzDecMt_Decode(), if xz stream contains only one block.
  * The changes for MSVS compiler makefiles:
    + the makefiles now use &quot;PLATFORM&quot; macroname with values
      (x64, x86, arm64) instead of &quot;CPU&quot; macroname with values
      (AMD64, ARM64).
    + the makefiles by default now use static version of the
      run-time library.
- Fixed unpacking problem
- Update to version 18.05
  * The speed for LZMA/LZMA2 compressing was increased
    by 8% for fastest/fast compression levels and
    by 3% for normal/maximum compression levels.
  * The BUG was fixed in Lzma2Enc.c
    Lzma2Enc_Encode2() function worked incorretly,
      if (inStream == NULL) and the number of block threads is
      more than 1.
- Refreshed lzma-sdk-shlib.patch
- Update to version 18.03
  * Asm\x86\LzmaDecOpt.asm: new optimized LZMA decoder written in
    asm for x64 with about 30% higher speed than main version of
    LZMA decoder written in C.
  * The speed for single-thread LZMA/LZMA2 decoder written in C
    was increased by 3%.
- Refreshed lzma-sdk-shlib.patch
- Update to version 18.01
  * Some changes in LZMA2/xz multithreading code for compressing.
    Some bugs were fixed.
- Update to new upstream release 17.01
  * Some bugs were fixed.
- Replace lzma-sdk-16.04-sharedlib.patch with lzma-sdk-shlib.patch.
- Trim/update description. Redo .pc file generation so that the
  resulting file looks like other .pc files on openSUSE.
- Refreshed lzma-sdk-16.04-sharedlib.patch to add source to
  the library to have extra functions and exported extra
  symbols
- Initial package (version 16.04)
