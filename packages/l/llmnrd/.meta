  <title>Link-Local Multicast Resolution (LLMNR) Daemon</title>
  <description>llmnrd is a daemon implementing the Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR)
protocol according to RFC 4795. It currently only supports Linux, as it uses the
netlink kernel interface.

llmnrd will respond to name resolution queries sent by Windows clients in
networks where no DNS server is available. It supports both IPv4 and IPv6.
