  <title>LaTeX-Based WYSIWYG Editor</title>
  <description>LyX is a front-end for LaTeX under X11. It combines the comfortable use
of a word processor with the high quality of LaTeX typesetting.
Documents are displayed in a WYSIWYG-like way. User does not choose low
level attributes (&quot;large italic&quot;) but high level layouts (styles) for
each paragraph. Of course, low level formatting is still possible.</description>
