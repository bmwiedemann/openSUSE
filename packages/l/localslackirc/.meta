  <title>IRC gateway for slack and rocket.chat</title>
  <description>IRC gateway for slack, running on localhost for one user. This project is a replacement for slack's IRC gateway that they dropped.

One instance of localslackirc connects to one slack account and one IRC client, passing the messages between the two.
