  <title>Very High Ratio and Speed Compression Designed for Large Files</title>
  <description>LRZIP is a compression program that can achieve very high compression
ratios and speed when used with large files. It uses the combined compression
algorithms of lzma for maximum compression, lzo for maximum speed, and the long
range redundancy reduction of rzip. It is designed to scale with increases
with RAM size, improving compression further. A choice of either size or
speed optimizations allows for either better compression than even lzma can
provide, or better speed than gzip, but with bzip2 sized compression levels.
