- update to 0.601: no user-visible changes

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 23 09:29:45 UTC 2011 - pascal.bleser@opensuse.org

- update to 0.600:
  * massive rewrite with new file format to accomodate new features
  * allocate temporary buffers of safely sized ram that can act as temporary
    storage for performing de/compression to/from STDIN/STDOUT without
    requiring temporary physical files; files compressed on machines with much
    larger ram being decompressed on smaller ram machines may still require
    temporary files, but as much as possible is done using in-ram
    decompression, and minimally sized temporary files; information displayed
    is more verbose and accurate in STDIN/STDOUT mode
  * the temporary buffers created for decompressing to STDOUT are also used for
    decompressing regular files now avoiding multiple write/reads when
    re-constructing the file on decompression: this can dramatically speed up
    the rzip phase of decompression on complicated files with many small
    matches, and always makes testing faster
  * compress block headers as well now since we know how many bytes can be used
    to describe the length of the block, decreasing overall file size
  * store the rzip chunk size per chunk to make it possible to check total file
    size by summating each rzip chunk size when it's not known till the end (as
    happens when compressing from STDIN)
  * implement password protected encryption:
    + import the polarssl code for sha512 and aes128 routines
    + read password without echoing to screen by disabling echo via terminfo
    + take the password then multiply hash it according to the date it was
      generated
    + increase the number of hashes according to Moore's law so it always takes
      approximately 1 second per password on the most modern hardware when first
      encrypted
    + hash the password against 8 bytes of salt which is a combination of the 2
      byte encoded loop counter (for how many times to hash the password) and 6
      random bytes
    + take random from /dev/urandom if it's available and fall back to random()
      if not
    + encrypt each block of compressed data with 8 extra bytes of random salt
    + once the headers are written, go back and encrypt the headers as well
    + then encrypt the md5 hash value as well
    + anything beyond the initial lrzip magic header should apppear as random
      data and no two successive encryptions of the same data with
      the same password should generate the same data
    + big Endian fixes
    + change lrztar and lrzuntar to not use temporary files
    + countless other fixes, documentation and cleanups

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 08 10:38:13 UTC 2011 - pascal.bleser@opensuse.org

- update to 0.571:
  * negative value allocs are now prevented with high thread/low RAM
    combinations
  * free space is now checked before attempting to compress or decompress, and
    the program aborts if there is inadequate space and -f is not enabled
  * the check for where data is going when refusing to write stdout to a
    terminal was corrected
  * temporary files are unlinked as soon as possible to minimize the chance of
    stale temporary files being left
  * file check can no longer be enabled when meaningless
  * the time displayed and progress when known from STDIN were fixed
  * spurious errors when trying to mmap files are avoided
  * temporary file sizes used when decompressing to STDOUT were minimized

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb 25 16:51:19 UTC 2011 - pascal.bleser@opensuse.org

- update to 0.570:
  * improvements were made for more CPU usage and faster compression and
    decompression
  * memory is now precisely controlled to avoid running out of memory while
    using the largest possible compression windows
  * a single thread is used when advantageous
  * verbose output options were added for -i information
  * the lrzip.conf features were updated
  * the -M option was dropped
  * the -T lzo testing option was changed to not take a parameter
  * deletion of files that the program has refused to overwrite is prevented
  * output in failure modes was made cleaner
  * default compiler flags were added
  * the program now refuses to read from or write to a terminal with
    stdin/stdout
  * missed temporary files are deleted
  * a large clean up of the documentation was done

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb 21 19:12:05 UTC 2011 - pascal.bleser@opensuse.org

- update to 0.560:
  * implement md5 hash checking on compression and decompression by using
    buffers to pass to the existing crc checking and re-using them for the md5
    checking
  * speed up the hash checking on compression by not reading the whole chunk at
    once to do the hash check, and instead read one paged size chunk
  * store the md5 hash value at the end of the archive, maintaining backward
    compatibility with existing 0.5 versions of lrzip, and places a flag in the
    header denoting its existence
  * use the header flag for md5's existence to determine what hash check to
    perform on decompression
  * add hash value display to maximum verbose output and in information mode
  * add -H option to enable hash value displaying without verbose mode
  * display what hash checking will be used on decompression in verbose mode
    and in information displayed with -i
  * add -c option to perform a hash check on the file generated on
    decompression, comparing it to that stored in the lrzip archive, or that
    generated on decompression on archives that do not have it stored
  * delete broken or damaged files generated on interruption or when they fail
    integrity testing by default
  * implement the -k option to keep broken or damaged files

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb 11 12:05:13 UTC 2011 - pascal.bleser@opensuse.org

- update to 0.552:
  * fix incompressible blocks causing failure with bzip2 and gzip
  * flush writes to disk before allocating ram
  * relax memory allocation when no back end compression will be used
  * clean up unnecessary semaphore usage in decompression
  * fix minor typos
  * convert mmaps to malloc in runzip as they may silently fail if not a
    multiple of page size, thereby leading to silent corruption on
    decompression
  * return the correct length by unzip_literal

- changes from 0.551:
  * fix stdin failing due to getting sizes all wrong
  * fix stdin compression values not being shown at end
  * fix inappropriate failure when lzma doesn't compress block

- changes from 0.550:
  * move the threading on compression to higher up in the code, allowing the
    next stream to start using compression threads before the previous stream
    has finished; this speeds up compression on files that take more than one
    pass to compress
  * limit the number of threads decompressing stream 0 to just 1 since it's
    always followed by stream 1 chunks, and it may lead to failure to
    decompress due to running out of memory by running too many threads
  * default compression level and window size on lzma is set to 7 which is the
    highest it goes; scale the 9 lrzip levels into 7, thus making the default
    lzma level 5 which uses a lot less memory and is substantially faster at
    the cost of some compression
  * rationalise the memory testing now that the default lzma settings use a lot
    less ram by default, and make all systems use no more than 1/3 ram in one
    mmap; this allows larger windows to be used by 32 bit at last without
    memory allocation errors
  * revert "Make threads spawn at regular intervals along chunk size thus
    speeding up compression" as it actually slowed it down instead of speeding
    it up
  * cope with compression/decompression threads failing by waiting till the
    previous thread has finished its work, thus serialising the work and using
    less ram, making success more likely
  * fix some dodgy callocs which weren't really allocating enough ram
  * destroy semaphores used in stream_in on closing the stream
  * minor output improvements

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov 24 17:36:35 UTC 2010 - pascal.bleser@opensuse.org

- update to 0.543:
  * now copes when there are multiple stream 0 entries per chunk, which would
    cause a failure on massive file decompression
  * a mistake in which lzma windows were being set far too small at all times
    was fixed
  * the nice level of the main process was decreased compared to back end
    threads as it tends to be the rate limiting step

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Nov 20 11:38:35 UTC 2010 - pascal.bleser@opensuse.org

- update to 0.542:

  * minor tweaks were made to output
  * the size of the high buffer in sliding mmap was rounded up to one page
  * a little more was squeezed out of 32-bit compression windows
  * a problem with sliding mmap from not working from the 2nd pass onwards,
    causing a slowdown of death, was fixed

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov 18 16:54:52 UTC 2010 - pascal.bleser@opensuse.org

- update to 0.541:
  * massive multithreading was implemented for decompression, making slower
    algorithms scale dramatically with number of CPUs, and completing huge
    scalability improvements on both compression and decompression
  * the output of zpaq consuming lots of CPU time and trampling on itself in
    the console was fixed
  * the control window is now ensured to be set appropriately on 32 bit
  * numerous minor output improvements were made
  * the docs and benchmarks were updated

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Nov 13 23:59:52 UTC 2010 - pascal.bleser@opensuse.org

- update to 0.530:
  * a massive multithreading implementation allows a huge speed-up on SMP
    machines during compression
  * the -p option was added to override the number of processors to use
  * the -P option was deprecated
  * the size of all compression windows was increased to minimize the number of
    headers written
  * screen output was altered to suit threading

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Nov  7 11:14:20 UTC 2010 - pascal.bleser@opensuse.org

- update to 0.5.2:

    600MB windows as well
  * page size is checked if possible instead of assuming it's always 4k
  * the progress output was improved
  * failure to chmod and failure to set nice level were changed to warnings only
  * a distinction between stderr messages and output was standardized

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov  5 23:33:46 UTC 2010 - pascal.bleser@opensuse.org

  * up to 44-bit sized offsets can be addressed on 32-bit machines on
    decompression
