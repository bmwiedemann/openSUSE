  <title>Elegant sans-serif Typeface Family</title>
  <description>Raleway is an elegant sans-serif typeface, designed by Matt McInerney,
initially in a single Thin weight. It is a display face that features
both old style and lining numerals, standard and discretionary ligatures,
a pretty complete set of diacritics, as well as stylistic alternates
inspired by more geometric sans-serif typefaces than it's neo-grotesque
inspired default character set.

With Matt's approval, we extendeded Raleway Thin into a full 9 weights
family, from Thin to Heavy. We also added True Italics for all the
9 weights, and expanded the Char-set support all 104 Latin Languages.</description>
