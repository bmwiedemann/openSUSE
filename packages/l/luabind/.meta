  <description>Luabind is a library that helps you create bindings between C++ and Lua. It has the ability to expose functions and classes, written in C++, to Lua. It will also supply the functionality to define classes in Lua and let them derive from other Lua classes or C++ classes. Lua classes can override virtual functions from their C++ base classes. It is written towards Lua 5.0, and does not work with Lua 4.</description>
