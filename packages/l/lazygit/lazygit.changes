Sat Mar 23 13:05:41 UTC 2024 - Jeff Kowalczyk <jkowalczyk@suse.com>

- Packaging improvments:
  * Update to BuildRequires: golang(API) >= 1.21 matching go.mod
  * Drop autosetup -n arg only needed when archive and package
    name differ
  * Build PIE with pattern that may become recommended procedure:
    %%ifnarch ppc64 GOFLAGS="-buildmode=pie" %%endif go build
    A go toolchain buildmode default config would be preferable
    but none exist at this time.
