Thu Apr 15 20:17:30 UTC 2021 - Luiz Angelo Daros de Luca <luizluca@tre-sc.jus.br>

- Update to 4.5.3:
  * CoreService class for Android can make the device vibrate while
    incoming call is ringing.
  * Audio conference API improved: distribution of participant list
    over RFC4575 SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY.
  * enterForeground() and enterBackground() automatically called
    (iOS and Android).
  * auto acquire and release of audio focus for Android.
  * Core.iterate() is being called automatically internally for
    Android, it is no longer needed to create a timer in the
    application to call it.
  * New audio routes API to choose which device use to capture &
    play audio (Android & iOS). The application can manage
  * audio route changes (bluetooth, speaker, earpiece) throug
    liblinphone's API.
  * Added API to play user's ringtone instead of default ringtone
    for Android.
  * Added callback to notify a message is about to be sent.
  * iOS: added linphone_core_configure_audio_session() to be called
    when used with Callkit
  * client-based video conference in active speaker switching mode
    (beta feature).
  * Warning: some function parameters have been renamed for
    consistency, which modified the Swift API (where parameter
    names are part of the ABI). As a result, adjustements in
    applications are expected when migrating a swift app based on
    liblinphone from 4.4 to 4.5.
  * Improved Android network manager.
  * To make it consistent with other liblinphone's object,
    linphone_core_create_subscribe(),
    linphone_core_create_subscribe2(),
    linphone_core_create_publish() now give ownership of the
    returned LinphoneEvent, which means that it is no longer need
    to call linphone_event_ref() after calling these functions. As
    a consequence, an application not using linphone_event_ref()
    should now use linphone_event_unref() when the LinphoneEvent is
    no longer used, otherwise it will create a memory leak.
  * Real time text related function
    linphone_chat_message_get_char() now will always return the
    new line character, which wasn't the case before if the
    get_char() was done after the composing callback was triggered
    for this character.
  * linphone_core_interpret_url() will unescape characters first if
    possible if only a username is given as input parameter.
  * linphone_chat_message_cancel_file_transfer() no longer deletes
    the file for outgoing messages.
  * magic search result created from filter now applies the
    international prefix of the default proxy config if possible.
  * To improve performance file transfer progress callback will be
    at most notified 100 times.
  * Deprecate linphone_core_audio_route_changed() that was
    introduced in 4.4, to fix audio issues
  * when switching audio to some low sample rate Bluetooth devices
    It is now handled internally.
  * Internal refactoring of management of locally played tones, in
    order to fix race conditions.
  * Magic search bar not looking in all friends lists.
  * Error IMDN in LIME chat rooms not properly sent.
  * Chat message lost during attachment auto download if Core
    stopped during the process.
  * Windows tests.
  * Name of MediaCodec encoder and decoder filters in H264Helper
    Java class.
  * Both FileContent and FileTransferContent being present in
    linphone_chat_message_get_contents() list until upload is
    finished.
