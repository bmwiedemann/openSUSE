    <comment>- Update to 1.5.3:
  - Bug Fixes
    - Correct a typo causing builds to fail on a fresh checkout.
- Update to 1.5.2:
  - New Features
    - Added pack cross-Lua helper/polyfill to the compiler env
      alongside unpack
    - Precompile built-in macros, improving startup time
      significantly.
    - Accept :global-mangle false in compiler opts to disable
      global mangling.
    - Stop printing sparse tables as sequences by default.
  - Bug Fixes
    - Defaults on fennel.repl.view-opts are no longer clobbered
      by (fennel.repl {:view-opts {}})
    - Fix a bug where fennel.view allowed non-integer
      :max-sparse-gap settings.
    - Prevent incorrect fennel.view output like {1 :x 1.2 :y 2
      :z} -&gt; [&quot;x&quot; &quot;y&quot; &quot;z&quot;] when max-sparse-gap is still satisfied
      by gaps between decimal keys.
    - Ensure fennel --plugin plug.lua loads the compiler env like
      it does for plug.fnl
    - Work around string formatting bug in Fengari.
    - Use options.warn when provided in the parser.
    - Fix an issue where unquoting a regular table would fail
      outside compile scope.
- Update to 1.5.1:
    - Bug Fixes, doc/fennel.doc: Don't mutate :fnl/arglist
      directly when showing callable form (set (. tgt k1 ...) v)
      now works on known globals and $, $1 ... $9 in hashfns
    - Macro quote expansion no longer breaks when sym, list or
      sequence is shadowed
    - Bring fennel.traceback behavior closer to Lua's traceback
      by not modifying non-string and non-nil values.
    - Avoid losing precision when compiling large numbers on
      LuaJIT.
    - Add syntax for representing infinity and NaN values.
- Update to 1.5.0:
  - New Features
    - Macro pick-values is now a special, allowing it to emit
      better Lua output.
    - Add fennel.getinfo as source-map-aware equivalent of
      debug.getinfo.
    - Optimize allocation away when destructuring tables to
      tables.
    - Allow &amp; and &amp;as in the same destructure clause.
    - More consistent module-not-found warnings for
      --require-as-include.
    - Improve compiler output for and/or forms with potential
      side-effects.
    - Allow locals in places where they make sense rather than
      mid-expression.
    - Accept --keywords option to add to the list of built-in Lua
      keywords.
    - REPL completion now works on partial REPL commands: e.g.
      ,complete ,d -&gt; ,doc.
    - Tables in the REPL default to printing with limited depth.
    - View settings in REPL can be changed: (set
      ___repl___.view-opts.depth 100).
    - Support dynamic field names in (set (. tbl field) val).
    - The fennel.compile function now accepts an AST, iterator,
      or file.
    - Catch typos when a space is missing after a string.
  - Bug Fixes
    - Don't non-nil assert on _foo arguments in lambda.
    - Propagate compile options into ,compile repl command.
    - IIFEs emitted by and/or inside (fn [...]) now propagate
      varargs. macrodebug on cyclic macro expansions now
      serialize to valid code (no @1, ..)
- Update to 1.4.2:
  - Bug Fixes
    - Fix a bug where (tail! (f x)) could sometimes compile to
      return return f(x)
    - Make tail! ensure its target is not a special form call
      like (tail! (or x (f)))
    - Fix broken man page installation on make install
- Update to 1.4.1:
  - This was the last release that provided Linux arm32 binaries.
  - New Features
    - Iterators accept locals wrapped in parens like all other
      multi-value bindings. fennel.repl is now a callable
      table, allowing the default (fennel.repl) options to
      be customized by setting option fields on the table
      itself. This accidentally caused incompatibility with
      coroutine.create.
  - Bug Fixes
    - Fix a bug with metadata tables in lambda being ignored.
    - Fix identity value for band operator.
    - Fix a bug in icollect with &amp;into and multiple values.
      assert-repl, as a drop-in replacement for assert, no longer
      takes an opts param
    - Fix a bug where (. (a-macro) k) bypassed protections
      against invalid Lua output
  - Changes and Removals
    - Deprecate the __fennelrest destructuring metamethod.
- Update to 1.4.0:
  - Bug Fixes
    - Prevent metadata from being accessible in compiler sandbox.
  - New Forms
    - Add tail! which asserts that the argument is called in tail
      position.
    - Add assert-repl to make an assertion which opens a repl
      when it fails.
  - New Features
    - Add --assert-as-repl flag to replace assert calls with
      assert-repl.
    - Allow you to return a value from the repl with ,return FORM
      command.
    - Save previous REPL values in *1, *2, and *3 locals.
    - Make repl prompt change when repl sessions get nested.
- Update to 1.3.1:
  - New Features
    - Expose REPL's methods in the ___repl___ table, allowing
      method redefinition at runtime.
    - Allow following docstring with a metadata table syntax.
    - Return whole metadata table when metadata.get is called
      without a key.
    - Add :byte-escape option to fennel.view for overriding
      default char escapes
    - Generate man pages for fennel-api(3), fennel-reference(5),
      and fennel-tutorial(7) from their respective documentation.
  - Note for packagers: The man page fennel.1 has been moved to
    man/man1/fennel.1 along with the new generated man pages. For
    build scripts that copy files manually in lieu of make
    install, this may require an update.
  - Bug Fixes
    - Fix a bug where operator compiler output had incorrect
      precedence with 3+ args
    - Fix a bug where the comment special would fail on forms
      containing &quot;]]&quot;
    - Fix a bug where tables like {:true 1 true 2} emit with
      unstable key order
    - Fix a bug where table literals mutated by a macro emit with
      unstable key order when AOT-compiled in Lua &gt; 5.2
    - Fix a bug where very long individual lines in the repl
      would be truncated
    - Fix an edge case where {:__metatable true} (as in
      pandoc-lua) breaks fennel.view
    - Fix a 1.3.0 bug where macros only accepts table literals,
      not table-returning exprs
    - Fix a bug where metadata tables with different arglists
      break lambdas
    - Fix a bug with detecting cycles for tables that have custom
      __pairs metamethod in fennel.view
    - Fix a bug where vararg couldn't be the only thing in a
      hashfn
- Update to 1.3.0:
  - New Forms
    - Add case which does pattern matching without pinning
      existing locals
    - Add case-try which works like match-try without pinning
      locals
    - Add faccumulate macro as range analog to accumulate
  - New Features
    - Reduced compiler memory footprint
    - Omit escape codes highlighting errors when NO_COLOR env var
      is set
    - Support &amp; for rest args in function arglists for
      consistency with let
    - Add error-pinpoint option to support custom error
      highlighting
    - The fn special now allows arbitrary compiler metadata keys
      via the metadata table syntax
    - Options in fennel.view can be altered for the next
      invocation of the pretty-printer by setting them to {:once
      val} or {:once val :after other-val}. See fennel.view
      docstring for more info
  - Bug Fixes
    - Fix a bug where readline repl history would be saved to the
      wrong file
    - Fix a bug where set did not catch unknown locals when
      setting table fields
    - Add a workaround for a bug around ctrl-d in readline
