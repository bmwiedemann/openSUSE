- Update to 1.6.0:
  - New Features
    - Support extra-compiler-env in options table when compiling.
    - Accept path in options table of fennel.install.
    - Improve printing of large integers in Lua 5.3+.
    - Allow disk reads from compiler sandbox.
    - Add --to-be-closed option for better stack traces in
      with-open on Lua 5.4.
    - Stack traces from macro errors shouldn't contain compiler
      internals.
    - Look for macros in .fnlm files in addition to .fnl files.
    - Support extra-env in compiler API when evaluating in
      compiler scope.
    - Allow --compile-binary to work on .lua and .luac files.
    - Add --lambda-as-fn option to remove overhead from arg
      checking.
  - Bug Fixes
    - Fix a bug where ,find repl command didn't work on files
      with long names.
    - Some 3-decimal string escapes ignored the 3rd digit; e.g.
      \x7f -> \127 -> \f7.
    - In PUC Lua 5.1, the escape "\127" compiled to a literal
      byte in the string.

      :max-sparse-gap settings.
    - Prevent incorrect fennel.view output like {1 :x 1.2 :y 2
      :z} -> ["x" "y" "z"] when max-sparse-gap is still satisfied
      by gaps between decimal keys.
    - Ensure fennel --plugin plug.lua loads the compiler env like
      it does for plug.fnl
    - Work around string formatting bug in Fengari.
    - Use options.warn when provided in the parser.
    - Fix an issue where unquoting a regular table would fail
      outside compile scope.
- Update to 1.5.1:
    - Bug Fixes, doc/fennel.doc: Don't mutate :fnl/arglist
      directly when showing callable form (set (. tgt k1 ...) v)
      now works on known globals and $, $1 ... $9 in hashfns
    - Macro quote expansion no longer breaks when sym, list or
      sequence is shadowed
    - Bring fennel.traceback behavior closer to Lua's traceback
      by not modifying non-string and non-nil values.

      side-effects.
    - Allow locals in places where they make sense rather than
      mid-expression.
    - Accept --keywords option to add to the list of built-in Lua
      keywords.
    - REPL completion now works on partial REPL commands: e.g.
      ,complete ,d -> ,doc.
    - Tables in the REPL default to printing with limited depth.
    - View settings in REPL can be changed: (set
      ___repl___.view-opts.depth 100).
    - Support dynamic field names in (set (. tbl field) val).
    - The fennel.compile function now accepts an AST, iterator,
      or file.

  - Bug Fixes
    - Don't non-nil assert on _foo arguments in lambda.
    - Propagate compile options into ,compile repl command.

    - Fix a bug where (tail! (f x)) could sometimes compile to
      return return f(x)
    - Make tail! ensure its target is not a special form call
      like (tail! (or x (f)))
    - Fix broken man page installation on make install
- Update to 1.4.1:
  - This was the last release that provided Linux arm32 binaries.
  - New Features
    - Iterators accept locals wrapped in parens like all other
      multi-value bindings. fennel.repl is now a callable
      table, allowing the default (fennel.repl) options to
      be customized by setting option fields on the table
      itself. This accidentally caused incompatibility with
      coroutine.create.
  - Bug Fixes
    - Fix a bug with metadata tables in lambda being ignored.
    - Fix identity value for band operator.
    - Fix a bug in icollect with &into and multiple values.

      position.
    - Add assert-repl to make an assertion which opens a repl
      when it fails.
  - New Features

      assert-repl.
    - Allow you to return a value from the repl with ,return FORM
      command.
    - Save previous REPL values in *1, *2, and *3 locals.
    - Make repl prompt change when repl sessions get nested.
- Update to 1.3.1:
  - New Features
    - Expose REPL's methods in the ___repl___ table, allowing
      method redefinition at runtime.
    - Allow following docstring with a metadata table syntax.
    - Return whole metadata table when metadata.get is called
      without a key.
    - Add :byte-escape option to fennel.view for overriding
      default char escapes
    - Generate man pages for fennel-api(3), fennel-reference(5),
      and fennel-tutorial(7) from their respective documentation.
  - Note for packagers: The man page fennel.1 has been moved to
    man/man1/fennel.1 along with the new generated man pages. For
    build scripts that copy files manually in lieu of make
    install, this may require an update.
  - Bug Fixes
    - Fix a bug where operator compiler output had incorrect
      precedence with 3+ args
    - Fix a bug where the comment special would fail on forms
      containing "]]"

      unstable key order

      unstable key order when AOT-compiled in Lua > 5.2
    - Fix a bug where very long individual lines in the repl
      would be truncated
    - Fix an edge case where {:__metatable true} (as in
      pandoc-lua) breaks fennel.view
    - Fix a 1.3.0 bug where macros only accepts table literals,
      not table-returning exprs
    - Fix a bug where metadata tables with different arglists
      break lambdas
    - Fix a bug with detecting cycles for tables that have custom
      __pairs metamethod in fennel.view
    - Fix a bug where vararg couldn't be the only thing in a
      hashfn
- Update to 1.3.0:
  - New Forms
    - Add case which does pattern matching without pinning
      existing locals
    - Add case-try which works like match-try without pinning
      locals
    - Add faccumulate macro as range analog to accumulate
  - New Features
    - Reduced compiler memory footprint
    - Omit escape codes highlighting errors when NO_COLOR env var
      is set
    - Support & for rest args in function arglists for
      consistency with let
    - Add error-pinpoint option to support custom error
      highlighting
    - The fn special now allows arbitrary compiler metadata keys
      via the metadata table syntax
    - Options in fennel.view can be altered for the next
      invocation of the pretty-printer by setting them to {:once
      val} or {:once val :after other-val}. See fennel.view
      docstring for more info

      wrong file
