- Update to 1.2.1
New Features
  * Add `fennel.install` function to the API for adding the
    searcher
  * Add missing `table?` predicate to fennel API to go with
    `list?`, `sym?`, etc

Bug Fixes
  * Skip autogenerated locals in repl locals saving to avoid
    exceeding local limit
  * Ensure `(values)` consistently evaluates to zero values
  * Fix bug preventing new macros from shadowing other macros
  * Ensure macros use stable `pairs` table traversal for
    reproducible builds

- Changes in 1.2.0:
New Forms
  * Add `fcollect` macro for range "comprehension"

New Features
  * Make `include` splice modules in where they're used instead of
    at the top
  * Add `ast-source` function to API to get file/line info from
    AST nodes
  * Show errors using terminal control codes instead of arrow
    indicator
  * Parser now includes column information (byte-based) in AST
    nodes
  * For greater consistency, add `&into`/`&until` to certain
    looping constructs

Bug Fixes
  * Duplicate table keys no longer crash the compiler
  * Don't print stack trace for compiler errors in built-in macros
  * Fix an issue with native modules in `--compile-binary`
  * Improve argument handling so unused arguments get passed on to
    script
  * Fix a bug where macros modifying table literals would emit
    incorrect output
  * Fix a bug in the REPL where parser errors display the error
    message as `nil`
  * Fix a bug when `nil` were emitted by `unquote` in a macro,
    and the macro was not compiled correctly because the resulting
    list length was calculated incorrectly
  * Fix a REPL bug where `,doc m.foo` did not resolve multisym to
    macro for macro modules loaded as macro table via
    `(import-macros m :my.macro.module)`

Changes in 1.1.0:
New Forms
  * Add `match-try` macro for chained pattern matching for steps
    which might fail

New Features
  * The `fennel.parser` function now accepts a string in addition
    to an iterator
  * The `accumulate` macro can now accumulate over multiple values
  * The `fn` special now accepts a metadata table in place of a
    docstring
  * The `,reload mod` repl command can now reload macro modules

Bug Fixes
  * Fix an issue where built-in macros would modify their AST
    arguments
  * Fix a bug where  `--skip-include` would mistakenly emit a
    warning
  * Remove hex string escapes to preserve PUC Lua 5.1 compatibility
  * Prevent errors resolving the target of certain repl commands
    from crashing
  * Fix a bug where disabling the compiler sandbox broke module
    require scope
  * Fix a bug where certain specials wouldn't short-circuit in
    `and`/`or`
  * Fix a bug where symbols bound to `nil` did not show up in REPL
    completion

Changes and Removals
  * Deprecate the `granulate` and `string-stream` functions in the
    API
  * Deprecate the `global` form in favor of using the `_G` table
