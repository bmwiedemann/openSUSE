  * Improved Libertine Bold (Small Caps, Cyrrilic ...).
  * New style: Libertine Monospaced for the use in listings, code examples etc.
  * Workaround in OS/2-Tabel for certain eBooks.

- Update to 4.7.5. From the upstream ChangeLog (excerpt):
  * added small cyrillic m (uni043C) to Biolinum and some other
    missing cyrillics
  * Inverted Interrobang (uni2E18) added
  * Add Substitution/Transposition brackets 2E02-0A
  * Problems with Fractions (ID 2665656): without a contextual
    chaining substitution fractions like 1/7 or 1/10
  * some glyphs were wrongly named
  * sun is now called uni263C 
  * I had to move that .cap-variants of the accents to the PUA,
    because they covered space where Unicode in between defined
    new characters. So I systematically moved the .cap-Accents
  * new point accent at uni0358
  * new Mark for uni0358 in many O/o-characters
  * improved support for POJ (Taiwan transcription)
  * now kerning for kernclasspair p.sc + a.sc 
  * first use of contextual chaining substitution:
    - when a combining accent follows an i, the dotlessi is
      used to prevent an accent crash
    - when one of the accented or leftwarding glyphs such as
      (ä, V) follow an f, a short neck version of f (f.alt) is
      being used for optical reasons
  * Added U+033B COMBINING SQUARE BELOW
  * Italic: Correction of schwa

    This version should be without this bug, the reason for the old

  • Italic variant now uses the same perfect OpenType-GSUB as the regular.

Mon Mar 03 14:41:51 CET 2008 - mfabian@suse.de

- update to 2.7.9. Changes from ChangeLog.txt:
  • new Hinting! Now it is possible to use Libertine with Word on
    Windows properly. The shape on screen should be clearer now
    on every system!
  • new kern pairs for better typography
  • some wrong contour directions corrected
  • many small corrections
  • OT "fina" has been removed from wordend-sigma
  • countless small improvements
  • kerning for Caps variant
  • the conflict (that came up lately with a library update)
    between underlined and regular is diminished
  • Symbols for „page“, „graph“, „picture“ and „table“ added
  • Oldstyle numbers (minuscle numbers) were just contained as
    proportionals. Somebody wanted them also as table numbers.
    Ladder became standard oldstyles now. Some of these glyphs
    look somehow thinner to fit them on the fixed width.
  • bold italic variant had a wrong style entry which seemed
    to confuse Mac's fonthandling, also other style confusions
    should be fixed now
  • bold italic also had wrong metrics which resulted in a
    cutoff of glyph parts and wrong line spacing.
  • großes Eszett hinzugefügt (uni1E9E) entsprechend
    Kapitälchen-Eszett
  • kleines Eszett so verändert, dass es zum großen passt
    (ſz statt  ſs), das vorige Eszett ist als germandbls.alt
    weiterenthalten
  • Im Stilsatz ss03 kann für Schweizer nun automatisch von
    Eszetts auf ss umgestellt werden.
  • die dt. ÄÖÜ sind nun von der Alternativposition an die
    rechte Stelle gerückt. Für die nichtdeutschsprachige Nutzung
    empfehlen sich jetzt die (vormals standart, jetzt aber auf
    die Alternativposition gewechselten Akzentuierten)
  • Due to A. Panovs help hopefully a lot of design
    improvements for the cyrrilic alphabet. 
  • Some changes in Small Caps for better spacing.
  • FO-overlap in Small Caps (due to wrong kerning entry) removed
  • Complete revision of the bold version. Should result in a
    clearer shape and better thin-width-contrast
  • Due to better support in the FontForge editor the
    OpenType-tables have been completely redefined.
