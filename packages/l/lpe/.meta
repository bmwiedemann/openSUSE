  <title>Small programming text editor</title>
  <description>Lpe stands for &quot;lightweight programmer's editor&quot;, and is exactly that.
It is designed to provide at the same time all the features that might
be required in a decent code editor and a light, intuitive feel that
makes it a pleasure to work with, making all necessary commands
accessible as easily as possible.</description>
