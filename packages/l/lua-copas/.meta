  <title>Coroutine Oriented Portable Asynchronous Services</title>
  <description>Copas is a dispatcher based on coroutines that can be used by TCP/IP servers. It uses LuaSocket as the interface with the TCP/IP stack. A server registered with Copas should provide a handler for requests and use Copas socket functions to send the response. Copas loops through requests and invokes the corresponding handlers. For a full implementation of a Copas HTTP server you can refer to Xavante as an example.</description>
