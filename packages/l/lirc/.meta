  <title>Tools for Infrared Receivers</title>
  <description>LIRC is a package that supports receiving and sending IR signals with
the most common IR remote controls. It contains a daemon that decodes
and sends IR signals, a mouse daemon that translates IR signals to
mouse movements, and a couple of user programs that allow you to
control your computer with a remote control.</description>
