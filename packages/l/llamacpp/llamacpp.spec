%description
The llama.cpp library provides a C++ interface for running inference
with large language models (LLMs). Initially designed to support Meta's
LLaMA model, it has since been extended to work with a variety of other models.

This package includes the llama-cli tool to run inference using the library.

%package -n libmtmd
Summary:        Library to run multimodals inference models

%description -n libmtmd
As outlined in the history, libmtmd is the modern library designed to
replace the original llava.cpp implementation for handling multimodal inputs.

Built upon clip.cpp (similar to llava.cpp), libmtmd offers several advantages:
- Unified Interface: Aims to consolidate interaction for various multimodal models.
- Improved UX/DX: Features a more intuitive API, inspired by the Processor class
  in the Hugging Face transformers library.
- Flexibility: Designed to support multiple input types (text, audio, images) while
  respecting the wide variety of chat templates used by different models.
