%description
Logstalgia is a website traffic visualization that replays or streams
Apache web-server access logs as a pong-like battle between the web
server and an never ending torrent of requests. Requests appear as
colored balls (the same color as the host) which travel across the
screen to arrive at the requested location. Successful requests are
hit by the paddle while unsuccessful ones (eg 404 - File Not Found)
are missed and pass through.
