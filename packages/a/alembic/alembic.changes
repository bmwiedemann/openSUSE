Wed Apr 28 14:46:23 UTC 2021 - Ferdinand Thiessen <rpm@fthiessen.de>

- Update to 1.8.0:
 API:
  * Dropped support for the ancient TR1, expect compilers to support
    at least support C++std11 and currently default to C++std14.
  * Removed ALEMBIC_LIB_USES_TR1 and ALEMBIC_LIB_USES_BOOST and
    instead expect the std versions like shared_ptr.
 Ogawa:
  * Better support emscripten and ARM toolchains by using memcpy
    to avoid dereferencing non-aligned pointers.
 AbcStitcher:
  * Propagate MetaData from the first of our ordered input archives
    over to the stitched output.
 Other:
  * Overhaul to support Imath 3
  * Fix for using Alembic as a 3rd party with Imath 3.
