- update to 1.8.4:
  * Add ALEMBIC_DEBUG_WARNINGS_AS_ERRORS to control the build in debug mode.
  * It is set to ON by default to preserve the current behavior.
  * Use add_compile_options instead of the older add_definitions. (PR371)
  * Fix the include dirs for AbcCoreHDF5 tests. (PR382)
  * Fix issue hinted at in Issue 223: use PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR instead of
  * CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR when embedding Alembic within another CMake project. (PR393)
  * On Windows _BitScanForward64 is only available when _WIN64 is defined.
  * When it is not, fall back on using _BitScanForward. (PR 373)
  * Fuzzer issue 49213 turned up some new malformed MetaData memory problems.
  * Indexed MetaData on the write side only allows 254 (plus the default empty one)
  * small (up to 256 bytes), we now throw if we encounter malformed MetaData.
  * We were also allowing empty property and object names through on the read side
  * even though the writer forbids this.
  * Finally integrate a couple of tests flagged by Taotao Gu's local fuzzer.
  * (PR391 and PR397)
  * Fuzzer issue 52939 showed that with certain malformed MetaData the pair
  * separator should NOT occur before the assign separator. (PR396)
  * N2f and N2d properties were not being correctly bound.(PR390)

    fulfill the Imath requirement.
  * Address report from GCC Undefined Behavior Sanitizer by initializing a couple
    of bools in OXform. 
  * Fix compile issue when using C++17 with Microsoft Visual Studio and use a
    hopefully much faster find first bit set when using that compiler. (Issue 358)
  * One of the fuzzer tests were was failing with 32 bit builds because of a
    different exception message.
  * Fix a bug with 32 bit memory mapped Windows builds.
  * Look for boost python a little differently, falling back on existing behavior.

Wed Apr 28 14:46:23 UTC 2021 - Ferdinand Thiessen <rpm@fthiessen.de>

- Update to 1.8.0:
 API:
  * Dropped support for the ancient TR1, expect compilers to support
    at least support C++std11 and currently default to C++std14.
  * Removed ALEMBIC_LIB_USES_TR1 and ALEMBIC_LIB_USES_BOOST and
    instead expect the std versions like shared_ptr.
 Ogawa:
  * Better support emscripten and ARM toolchains by using memcpy
    to avoid dereferencing non-aligned pointers.
 AbcStitcher:
  * Propagate MetaData from the first of our ordered input archives
    over to the stitched output.
