- Update to version 1.2.1
  * This release fixes a security vulnerability that could allow
    an attacker to execute an arbitrary binary under certain
    conditions.
    See: https://github.com/FiloSottile/age/security/advisories/GHSA-32gq-x56h-299c
  * Plugin names may now only contain alphanumeric characters or
    the four special characters +-._.

- Update to version 1.2.0
  * A small release to build the release binaries with a more
    recent Go toolchain, and to fix a couple CLI edge cases.
  * The Go module now exposes a plugin package that provides an age
    plugin client. That is, Recipient and Identity implementations
    that invoke a plugin binary, allowing the use of age plugins
    in Go programs.
  * Finally, Recipients can now return a set of "labels"
    by implementing RecipientWithLabels. This allows replicating
    the special behavior of the scrypt Recipient in third-party
    Recipients, or applying policy useful for authenticated
    or post-quantum Recipients.

- Update to version 1.1.1
  Plugins support
  * The age CLI now supports plugins, such as age-plugin-yubikey
  Breaking changes
  * If -i is used, passphrase-encrypted files are now rejected.
  * Empty final chunks are now rejected.
  Minor changes
  * PKCS#8-encoded Ed25519 private keys (such as 1Password exports)
    are now supported as SSH identities.
  * If an armored file is pasted into the terminal, age will now
    attempt to wait until the end of the file before prompting for
    a password.
  * Some invalid files are now correctly rejected, in particular
    encrypted files with trailing data.
  * If /dev/tty is present but can't be opened, age will now
    fallback to trying to treat stdin as a terminal as if
    /dev/tty wasn't present.
  * Input prompts now go to the terminal, even if standard error#
    is redirected.
  * Values of the new armor.Error type are now returned wrapped in
    decryption errors when appropriate.
  * Documentation and error messages were improved.
