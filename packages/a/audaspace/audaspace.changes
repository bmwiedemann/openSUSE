Sat Feb  4 17:22:00 UTC 2023 - Stefan Brüns <stefan.bruens@rwth-aachen.de>

- Update to release 1.4.0
  * Support for OS specific/native audio devices/backends has been
    added, that is PulseAudio (Linux), WASAPI (Windows) and
    CoreAudio (MacOS).
  * New sound effects have been added, namely Modulator and
    Equalizer. Thanks to Marcos Perez for contributing the
    Equalizer.
  * File stream info: if an audio file contains multiple streams
    you can choose which one to process instead of taking the first
    one (this feature is only supported by ffmpeg, not libsndfile).
  * API Change: double instead of float for time values for more
    precise timing control.
  * There have been lots of bugfixes, which are basically the
    majority of all changes.
  * And some other minor improvements were implemented as well.
- Drop upstream patches:
  * audaspace-gcc7.patch
  * audaspace-plugin-build-options.patch
  * audaspace-support-ffmpeg4.patch
  * 034645c883a51dfc8897dccce15aa8ee4a9d5c8c.patch
- Add pkgconfig(pulse) to allow audio via pulseaudio/pipewire
- Use pkgconfig(jack), let distro select jack implementation
- Split plugins packages to avoid pulling in excessive
  dependencies, and recommend at least one device plugin from
  the library.

- Created package audaspace which was previously a part of blender
  but is an external standalone library as from blender 2.80.
- Created audaspace-datetime.patch to remove time stamps from the
  documentation.
- Created audaspace-pkgcnflib.patch to give the correct _libdir for
  x86_64 builds, it was hardcoded to /lib.
- Features:
  *input/output devices
   input from microphones, line in, etc.
   output devices including 3D audio support
  *file reading/writing
  *filters like low-/highpass and effects like delay, reverse
   or fading
  *generators for simple waveforms like silence, sine and triangle
  *respecification - is used for changing stream parameters which are
   channel count - channel remapping
   sample format - the library internally uses 32 bit floats
   sample rate - resampling
  *simple (superposition, joining and ping-pong aka forward-reverse)
   and more complex (non-linear audio editing) sequencing of sounds
