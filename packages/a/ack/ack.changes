   [bnc#855340] [CVE-2013-7069]

    execution when using ack through malicious files

    the global /etc/ackrc, your own private ~/.ackrc, the ACK_OPTIONS
    environment variable, and of course from the command line.
  * Now ignores Eclipse .metadata directory.
- includes changes form 2.11_02:

    of parentheses
  * Ack would get confused when trying to colorize the output in
    DOS-format files

Mon Sep 19 08:08:13 UTC 2011 - puzel@suse.com

  * Added Groovy support (--groovy).
  * Added .pm6 as a --perl extension.
  * Lua can now get detected from the shebang line.  Thanks,
    Matthew Wild.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Sep 17 10:44:39 UTC 2011 - jengelh@medozas.de

- Remove redundant tags/sections from specfile
- Use %_smp_mflags for parallel build

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov 16 10:38:26 UTC 2010 - puzel@novell.com

- update to 1.94: 
 [ENHANCEMENTS]
  * Added support for Go and Delphi.
  * Ignores Monotone's _MTN directories.
  * Added .xsl to the list of --xml files.

- changes from 1.93_02:
  [FIXES]
  * --man and --version now return with an exit code of 0 (they used to exit with a 1)

  [ENHANCEMENTS]
  * the --ignore-dir option now can ignore entire paths relative to your current directory
  * added --invert-file-match switch to negate the sense of the -g/-G switches

- changes from 1.93_01:
  [FILE TYPE UPDATES]
  * added --verilog, --vhdl and --clojure
  * files that match *.mk and *.mak as well as GNUmakefile are now included in the ack filetype 'make' (issue 88)
  * added RSpec's .spec type to the --ruby list

  [ENHANCEMENTS]
  * added docs for -r, -R, --recurse options
  * added new switch --color-lineno and environment variable ACK_COLOR_LINENO, which allow setting the line number color
  * added option --show-types to output the types that ack considers a file to have
  * 'ack --count --no-filename regex' doesn't output a list of numbers but a sum of all occurences; this is NOT what grep does but is the more sensible behavior

  [FIXES]
  * fixed ack misbehavior when using --match or not specifying a regex
  * fixed issue 74: analog to grep, 'ack --count regex file' now only outputs the number of found matches, if only one file is given
  * fixed issue 76: giving both --line and a regex (with --match) now leads to an error; the same is true for -f or -g in conjunction with --match
  * fixed issue 80: piping into ack --count now works as expected: ack always returned 0 when piped into, no matter how many matches where found
  * fixed issue 81: .ackrc now ignores leading/trailing whitespace

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov 11 23:00:39 UTC 2010 - pascal.bleser@opensuse.org

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Feb 14 22:09:12 UTC 2010 - pascal.bleser@opensuse.org

- removed bash completion file, way too slow

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Feb 14 21:53:01 UTC 2010 - pascal.bleser@opensuse.org

- update to 1.92:
 [ENHANCEMENTS]
  * Added Scala support.  Thanks to Dan Sully.
  * Added .phtml as an extension for PHP.
  * Using -f or -g now return a proper error code.  If files are
    found, ack returns 0.  If none are found, ack returns 1.  This
    is a change in the specification, but the code didn't match the
    specfication anyway.
  * No man pages are created for any of the .pm files any more.
 [FIXES]
  * The --pager flag would not work.  Now it does.  Thanks Packy
    Anderson.
  * File matching for Emacs work files that match #*# was wrong.
    It was checking the entire path, not just the basename.  This
    is fixed.  (http://github.com/petdance/ack/issues/closed/#issue/101)
  * Fixed URLs that pointed to old Google Code.

- split out perl-App-Ack into its own subpackage

-------------------------------------------------------------------

    auto-completion file
