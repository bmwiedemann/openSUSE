%description
This is a collection of decompression routines for old formats popular
in the Amiga, Atari computers and some other systems from 80's and 90's
as well as some that are currently used which were used in a some
specific way in these old systems.

For simple usage both a simple command line application as well as a
simple API to use the decompressors are provided. The compression
algorithm is automatically detected in most cases, however there are some
corner cases where it is not entirely reliable due to weaknesses in the
old format used.
