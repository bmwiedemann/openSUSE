%description
Active Directory services tool for samba.
For join, unjoin, provisioning, demotion, user/group and password administration,
ldap attribute modification, posix enablement, kdc timesync, pam and nss configuration,
daemon start/stop, cache flush, etc.
The ads command attempts to maintain compatibility with the proprietary vastool command,
while also adding additional features relevant to samba (such as kdc provisioning).
