  <title>Converts ASCII Text into PostScript</title>
  <description>a2ps converts ASCII text into PostScript. This feature is used by
apsfilter, for example, to pretty-print ASCII text.

Warning: a2ps is not able to convert complex unicode (UTF-8) text to
PostScript.  Only language text which can be converted from UTF-8 to
latin encodings are supported.</description>
