%description
This package contains a tool to convert perf.data profile to AutoFDO
profile that can be used by GCC and LLVM.

Each compiler is supported by a different tool. For GCC, use
'create_gcov'. For LLVM, use 'create_llvm_prof'. The two tools
have compatible command line flags. However, the outputs are
incompatible. You cannot use the profile generated for GCC in
LLVM and vice-versa.
