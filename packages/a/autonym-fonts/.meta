  <title>A font that can render all language autonyms</title>
  <description>If we want to show a large number of languages written in their own scripts
(autonyms), we cannot apply the usual webfonts to it. This is because since
each script require a webfonts, we will end up in using a large number of
webfonts. This can cause large bandwidth usage.

Autonym font tries to solve this. The font contains glyphs and opentype rules
for rendering the language autonyms. And it contains only those glyphs for a
language. For example, for Thai, the font has glyphs required for rendering ไทย 
alone.</description>
