    <comment>Fork of RawTherapee with the following main differences:
* The user interface and the underlying processing pipeline have been significantly restructured, with many tools removed, some new tools added, and several tools rewritten and/or refactored.
* Various new tools for performing local edits have been added, with support for various masking modes (both drawn and parametric).
* A new automatic perspective correction tool (taken from darktable) has been added.
* Better metadata handling (thanks to the exiv2 and exiftool libraries), with (optional) support for reading and writing XMP sidecar files.
* Support for using LibRaw for decoding raw files. </comment>
