    <comment>Fork of RawTherapee with the following main differences:
* The user interface and the underlying processing pipeline have been significantly restructured, with many tools removed, some new tools added, and several tools rewritten and/or refactored.
* Various new tools for performing local edits have been added, with support for various masking modes (both drawn and parametric).
* A new automatic perspective correction tool (taken from darktable) has been added.
* Better metadata handling (thanks to the exiv2 and exiftool libraries), with (optional) support for reading and writing XMP sidecar files.
* Support for using LibRaw for decoding raw files. </comment>

    <comment>- Disable LTO, since it makes the program crashing.

    <comment>- Update to 1.16.2:
  * Fixed bug in fast-path for output profile application.
  * Fixed segfault when the thumb cache contains an invalid date.
  * Update camera matrices.
  * Update translations.
  * LUT: protect against NaN indices.
  * Img out: added custom ICC profile conversion to avoid clamping to [0,1].
  * Color correction: added LUT mode.
  * Handle linear DNG as other raw images.
  * Tonecurve: improved range for the saturation2 curve.
  * Denoise: some tweaks to the detail mask.
  * Filmsimulation: added support for ACES clf LMT LUTs using OpenColorIOv2.
  * Logenc: added highlight precompression.
  * Tonecurve: allow whitepoint to go up to 100 (~10000 nits).

    <comment>- Update to 1.16.3:
  * editorpanel: fixed refresh of image area when switching images
  * clutstore: do not search for working profile in the file name for CLF LUTs
  * pipeline: move film simulation earlier (right after tone curve)
  * tone equalizer: improved robustness of regularization with hdr images
  * avoid infinities when loading and manipulating hdr images
  * exposure: do not use a LUT, it's not needed
  * fixed bug in applying partial profiles in append mode from the combobox
  * filecatalog: let the user choose which sidecars to affect when deleting a file
  * colorcorrection: slightly extend the range of offset sliders
  * tonecurve: fixed glitch in expansion of curve according to the white point
  * denoise: testing new ways of adjusting parameters according to the scale factor
