  * Saving bytecode for a never returning function would cause assert failure
  * Fixed an error when compiling a class method call as post-op and the name matches a type name
  * Template types are now properly identified in separate namespaces
  * Fixed memory build-up due to delayed cleanup when discarding modules with shared entities
  * opImplCast with variable type won't be used for non-ref types
  * Fixed compiler error when both opConv and opImplConv are implemented
  * Fixed bug when loading bytecode containing shared interfaces with inheritance
  * auto declarations now works correctly with implicit handle types
  * Initializing an ASHANDLE type with overloaded opHndlAssign taking a var type as a handle wasn't done correctly
  * Fixed loading byte code that uses external shared classes in namespace
  * The bytecode for external shared entities is no longer saved in the module when inherited from
  * Bytecode with external shared classes with virtual methods failed to load from bytecode
  * Fixed assert failure on call to opCast(?&out) with a non-variable expression
  * Passing a string literal to function expecting &out will now give compiler error
  * Fixed problem in compiler that didn't release a temporary variable when passing anonymous object to function expecting ?&in
  * Fixed a bug when loading bytecode having identical shared functions in different namespaces
  * Compiler will now detect name conflict between property and function
  * asIScriptFunction::GetDeclaration(false, true) no longer includes the namespace before the function name for class methods
  * Fixed assert failure in asIScriptEngine::RefCastObject when object has multiple opCast methods
  * Compiler no longer accepts primitives in the right hand expression for handle assignments
  * Fixed compiler warning with use of asOFFSET on 64bit platforms
  * Fixed crash caused by CreateScriptObjectCopy when script class' constructor takes argument by handle
  * Child funcdefs in templates will no longer convert parameter types to @const&
  * Fixed problem when compiling anonymous initialization list from default arg
  * Ownership of shared template instances wasn't correctly transferred when discarding modules
  * Fixed crash in compiler when matching anonymous list to function taking funcdef
  * Fixed assert failure in builder when compiling external shared interfaces with inheritance
  * Fixed crash in compiler when invalid script has inheritance from class with duplicate methods

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb 28 16:52:32 UTC 2017 - rpm@fthiessen.de

- Update to new upstream release 2.31.2
  * Fixed big endian errors in the compiler related to enum values
  * CreateScriptObject crashed when called for template value types
  * Fixed crash when discarding modules containing shared funcdefs
  * Fixed big endian errors in the compiler related to implicit
    conversions of constants
  * Fixed bug with saved byte code not being portable between
    32bit and 64bit platforms when including ChkNullS instruction
  * Fixed assert failure in compiler when compiling
    invalid switch case
  * Fixed bug in compiler when passing a @& argument to a function
  * Fixed bug when compiling get property accessor returning
    a registered type that is then implicitly converted to another
  * Fixed assert failure when compiling boolean not operator
    on constant
  * Fixed incorrect compiler warning about too large value when
    assigning negative value to const int8/int16
  * Compiler emits warnings if 64bit integer constants cannot
    fit when implicitly converted to smaller types
  * Compiler didn't support implicitly converting constant uint64
    values to uint32 values
  * Fixed assert failure when compiling comparison operator on
    boolean constant
  * Fixed bug in bytecode serialization when adjusting pointer
    sizes for calls using asBC_ALLOC
  * Fixed problem with registering types using the
    asOBJ_IMPLICIT_HANDLE flag
  * Fixed assert failure on implicit conversion from 8/16 bit
    uint constant to integer
  * opCast(?&out) on null handle now works without raising
    null pointer exceptions
  * Corrected as_config.h so Linux for 64bit ARM doesn't try to
    compile as_callfunc_x64_gcc.cpp
  * Fixed crash on GCC 6 due to CastToObjectType
    accepting this == null
