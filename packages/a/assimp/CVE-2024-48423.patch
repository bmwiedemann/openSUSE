Subject: [PATCH] Fix use after free in the CallbackToLogRedirector (#5918)

The heap-use-after-free vulnerability occurs in the
CallbackToLogRedirector function. During the process of logging,
a previously freed memory region is accessed, leading to a
use-after-free condition. This vulnerability stems from incorrect
memory management, specifically, freeing a log stream and then
attempting to access it later on.

This patch sets NULL value for The DefaultStream global pointer.
