Tue Sep  1 23:57:08 UTC 2020 - Michael Ströder <michael@stroeder.com>

- Update to version 2.4.4
  * Security
    - prevent XSS and open redirect on OIDC session management OP iframe,
      introducing generic OIDCRedirectURLsAllowed primitive; thanks Andrew Brady
    - add OIDCStateCookiePrefix primitive for the state cookie prefix to anonymise the state cookie name
  * Bugfixes
    - fix double Set-Cookie behaviour when using OIDCSessionType client-cookie,
      calling the session info hook and writing out a session update (twice); thanks @deisser
    - reverse order of creating HTML response and writing the (client-type)
      session cookie in the session info hook so the session data is actually saved; thanks @deisser
    - delete state cookie when it cannot be decoded/decrypted
    - avoid an Apache authorisation error and HTTP 500 when logout is triggered by a different RP
  * Features
    - add conditional expression to OIDCUnAuthAction to override auto-detection of
      non-browser requests; see #479; thanks @raro42 and @marcstern
  * Other
    - fixes for various compiler warnings/issues (older and newer versions of GCC)
    - add grant_types to dynamic client registration request [OIDC conformance test suite]
    - don't send access_token in user info request when method is set to POST
      [OIDC conformance test suite]
    - add recommended cache headers on backchannel logout response
      https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-backchannel-1_0.html#rfc.section.2.8 [OIDC conformance test suite]
    - allow Content-Type check on backchannel logout to have postfixes (utf-8 etc.) [OIDC conformance test suite]

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug 11 08:20:49 UTC 2020 - Michael Ströder <michael@stroeder.com>

- Update to version 2.4.3
  * Bugfixes
    - prevent open redirect on refresh token requests
    - add new OIDCRedirectURLsAllowed primitive to handle post logout
      and refresh-return-to validation
      addresses #453; closes #466
    - when stripping cookies, add a space between cookies in the resulting header (required by RFC 6265)
    - fix compilation against Apache 2.0
  * Features
    - add OIDCStateInputHeaders that allows configuring the header values 
      used to calculate the fingerprint of the state during authentication
    - added OIDCValidateIssuer primitive to allow for disabling of issuer 
      matching, helps to support multi-tenant applications i.e. Microsoft AAD

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 25 14:25:24 UTC 2020 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

    document text to be sent on some Apache 2.4.x versions
  * if OIDCPublicKeyFiles contains a certificate, the corresponding
    x5c, x5t and x5t#256 parameters will be added to the generated
    jwkset available at "<redirect_uri>?jwks=rsa"
  - fix: also add SameSite=None to by-value session cookies

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug 22 20:40:24 UTC 2019 - Michael Ströder <michael@stroeder.com>

- Update to version 2.4.0

Important
  * version 2.4.0 carries quite a number of relatively small changes (see: 
    Bugfixes and Features below) that are subtle but may impact runtime 
    behavior nevertheless; you should verify an upgrade in a test environment 
    before rolling out to production
  * this release deprecates the OAuth 2.0 Resource Server functionality 
    which is now implemented as a separate module mod_oauth2.

Bugfixes
  * URL-encode client_id/client_secret when using client_secret_basic according to:
    https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-2.3.1
  * fix parsing and caching of OIDCOAuthServerMetadataURL; thanks Lance Fannin
  * fix oidc_proto_html_post auto-post-submit so it no longer results in
    duplicate parentheses; closes #440; thanks @gobreak
  * fix RSA JWK x5c parsing issue (e.g. when parsing n fails): explicitly set the kid into to JWK
  * fix OIDCOAuthAcceptTokenAs post so POST data is propagated and not lost; see #443
  * fix JWT decryption crashing on non-null terminated input
  * fix not clearing claims in session when setting claims to null; closes #445; thanks @FilipVujicic

Features
  * support refresh and access tokens revocation from an RFC 7009 endpoint 
    upon OIDC session logout
  * make sure the content handler is called for every request to the 
    configured Redirect URI so all Apache processing is executed (e.g. 
    setting headers with mod_headers) before returning the response; thanks 
    Don Sengpiehl (NB: this may affect browser behavior and backwards 
    compatibility)
  * add ability to view session info in HTML via the session info hook via <redirect_uri)?info=html
  * enable per-provider signing and encryption keys in multi-provider setups (with limitations)
  * no longer use the fixup handler for environment variable setting but do it as part of the authn handler
  * add logout_on_error option to OIDCRefreshAccessTokenBeforeExpiry to 
    kill the session when refreshing an access token fails; thanks @rickyepoderi
  * be smart about picking the token endpoint authentication method when 
    not configured explicitly: don't choose the first one published by the OP 
    but prefer client_secret_basic if that is listed as well see: 
    panva/node-oidc-provider#514; thanks @richard-drummond and @panva

Other
  * remove option OIDCScrubRequestHeaders that allows for skipping 
    scrubbing request headers, thus avoiding potentially insecure setups
  * log the original URL for expired state cookies, useful for debugging 
    SPA/JS issues
  * add debug logs in oidc_proto_generate_random_string to allow for 
    spotting lack of entropy in the random number generator (on VM 
    environments) more easily
  * add USE_URANDOM compile time option to use /dev/urandom explicitly for 
    non-blocking random number generation: configure with 
    APXS2_OPTS="-DUSE_URANDOM"
  * allow removing an access token from the cache ("remove_at_cache") when 
    running in OAuth 2.0 RS mode only

-------------------------------------------------------------------

  * add session expiry info to session info hook response
    + session inactivity key is timeout now (was exp)
    + session expiry key is exp
  Other

    not providing apr_memcache.h
