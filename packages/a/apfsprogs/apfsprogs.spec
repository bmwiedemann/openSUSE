%description
apfsprogs is a suite of userland software to work with the Apple File System
on Linux. It's intended mainly to help test the Linux kernel module that can
be retrieved from <git://github.com/eafer/linux-apfs-rw.git>. The following
are included:

  o mkapfs: an experimental filesystem build tool
  o apfs-snap: a tool to take snapshots of a volume mounted with our module
  o apfsck: a filesystem integrity checker, for now only useful for testers
