-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug 13 22:24:17 UTC 2021 - Marcus Rueckert <mrueckert@suse.de>

- Update to version 6.9.0
  - Plugin Manager
    - Find it under the Window top-level menu
    - The Plugin Manager provides a complete list of plugins that
      were found on your system, and data about each plugin's scan
      results.
    - New standalone scanner applications for VST and AU plugins
      will scan your whole plugin collection without danger of
      crashing Ardour.
    - The new scanner dialog allows you to skip individual plugins
      without canceling the whole scan process. Or set the scanner
      to auto-timeout while you take a break, and come back later
      to re-scan those individual plugins that wanted some user
      input.
    - Sort and filter your plugins by name, brand, tags, or format.
    - Tell Ardour to Ignore troublesome plugins so we won't try to
      load them at all.
    - Ardour loads AU, VST2, VST3, and LV2 format plugins. Choose
      the format that works best for each plugin, and hide the ones
      you don't use (but might be used in some existing sessions).
  - Improvements
    - Playlist Management Substantial changes to playlist
      management include:
      - Global playlist actions like "New Playlist for rec-armed
        tracks" allow you to record a new take on all tracks that
        are record-armed, whether they are in a Group or not.
        You'll find these actions in the Track menu.
      - "Copy Playlist for All Tracks" will store the timeline
        state of your arrangement, edits and automation. You can
        later switch between them while leaving your static mixer
        and plugin settings intact.
      - Select a track and click "?" keyboard shortcut to open the
        Playlist Selector dialog. Click any playlist to listen to
        the alternative takes of that track, OR...
      - ...change the scope to "ALL Tracks" and you can switch all
        tracks that have a matching playlist to your selection: if
        you recorded a take of the drums and bass together, you can
        switch the drum and bass playlists together even if they
        aren't in a Group.
      - Create the perfect vocal or guitar comp: Create a new empty
        playlist and call it 'comp'. Then use the selector to
        switch between different takes and move the best take to
        your comp playlist. You can even have more than one comp
        playlist to compare with each other. And like the other
        playlist functions, you can edit multitracks with ease: by
        group, rec-armed, or ALL tracks.
    - Varispeed Changes
      - The GUI for the "shuttle control" has been modified to
        present a simpler, easier to understand interface.
      - Click on the "VS" button to enable/disable varispeed as
        well adjusting the varispeed settings. .
      - The VS button will blink when varispeed is enabled.
      - Varispeed settings are persistent, so you can revert to
        regular playback, then later re-enable varispeed to get
        back.
    - New GUI control allows blocking MIDI patch changes during
      session loading.
    - Preference items to enable/disable VST2 and/or VST3 support.
    - Add explicit actions for changing between stacked and
      overlaid region views, making this bindable (to a computer
      keyboard or MIDI).
    - LV2 plugins: add support for plugins with multiple Atom ports
      (e.g. Sfizz, the SFZ player)
    - Slip-contents editing now more easily accessible using
      Ctrl-Shift-drag (Cmd-Shift-drag on macOS) anywhere in a
      region. It is no longer necessary to place the mouse cursor
      near the edges of the region.
    - Fix drawing the red recording rectangle to honor latency
      compensation (region no longer visibly jump at rec-stop).
  - Bug Fixes
    - Splash screen management has been changed. On Linux, this may
      conflict with your window manager's behavior - if so, go to
      Edit > Preferences > Appearance > Quirks and try the
      "Show/Hide" setting.
    - Support for a Wine/windows build to run Windows VST plugins
      "natively" on Linux has been removed. ardour.org has never
      distributed these builds. There are plugin wrappers/bridges
      such as Yabridge that do a better job of making this
      possible.
    - Muted MIDI regions are now actually muted.
    - MIDI capture duration is correctly computed when loop
      recording.
    - MIDI capture alignment is now correctly implemented.
    - Loop recording working again after an unnoticed breakage.
    - Various fixes for recently added region markers during
      editing.
    - The "Escape" key now behaves identically while in internal
      editing modes as when in other mouse modes.
    - Prevent accidental addition of multiple markers at the same
      position.
    - In the Recorder tab, do not show input meters for
      control-only ports Faderport, Mackie, etc.
    - During a slip-contents drag, regions are now transparent so
      that you can align transients.
    - Fix Apple Coreaudio Source (used for MP3 import on macOS) --
      was broken since 6.0
  - Control Surfaces
    - US2400: Fix direction of pan knob LEDs.
    - Mackie Control
      - Change combined meter to use a peak meter with falloff.
      - Reset surfaces once connected.
      - Correctly handle the Monitor section being removed.
      - Update the meters even when the transport is stopped.
      - Move meter deflection calc to a function.
      - Improved support for iCON QCon Pro X.
      - When reconnecting ports, don't give up on first failure.
      - Don't call port write directly since it bypasses active
        chk.
      - Improve debug trace output by skipping meter write output.
      - Hold the surfaces lock while resetting the master_surface.
      - Don't crash when the master is on the right.
      - Use selected device's info when building the Keys dialog.
      - Fix one off error in timecode display that broke spaces.
      - Use space as replacement for invalid characters on timecode
        display.
      - Fix logic in timecode display update.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul  6 23:01:03 UTC 2021 - Marcus Rueckert <mrueckert@suse.de>

- Update to version 6.8.0.
  - New Features
    - Playlist Operations (sponsored by Harrison Consoles) A new
      menu Track > Playlist, provides actions to create new
      playlists (or a copied playlist) for (all | rec-armed |
      selected) tracks.

      Playlist naming and grouping behavior has changed:

      - When creating a new playlist, the user is always prompted
        for a playlist name (default value is Take.N where N
        auto-increments). In the past, some playlist actions didn't
        prompt for a name while others did, resulting in
        inconsistent naming.
      - When a playlist is created, ardour assigns it a group-id
        (timestamp) which can later be used to recognize playlists
        that were created as part of the same action. In the past,
        ardour tried to match grouped playlists via name but this
        relationship was unclear to the user.
      - A playlist group-id is also implicitly created when you
        first record to an empty playlist. This solves the problem
        in the past where user-created playlists would select
        together as a group, but the initial track playlist had no
        group relationship and therefore could not follow the group
        selection.
      - The dialog accessed via the "P" button in the track header
        (editor view) has been adjusted: some esoteric playlist
        functions (copy from other track, share from other track,
        and steal from other track) are now hidden under an
        "Advanced" submenu. You can now also show more than one
        track's "Select Playlist" dialog simultaneously, the dialog
        is persistent rather than closing when you make a
        selection: this makes it easier to audition playlists
        ("takes") and copy from one to another

    - Performance Meters: Window > Performance Meters now provides
      low level metering of the "DSP" taking place inside Ardour.
      Notice that the numbers display in the window are worst case
      which may not match the behavior of some other measurement
      tools (e.g. the main "DSP meter" in the upper right of the
      main window) or other DAWs. Average values (along with std.
      deviation values) can be seen by mousing-over any given
      meter. Thanks to Robbert van der Helm for his participation
      in the development process for these meters.
    - Add support for requesting specific CPU DMA latency values
      (can improve DSP performance on some systems, and degrade it
      or have no impact on other systems). If you don't understand
      what this does, then it's probably best to leave it alone.
    - Add extend-selection (to end of region) and invert-selection
      operations for MIDI editing
    - New track edit operation "remove gaps", with adjustable
      threshold and "leave" parameters
    - Add M4A import support
    - MIDI Tracer windows now come with their own port for
      arbitrary tracing of MIDI data
  - Improvements
    - Add bypass control to ACE-Fluidsynth
    - Add a MIDNAM file for Yamaha P-121/125 keyboards
    - Do not trigger ruler display when changing between BBT
      subdivisions for the grid
    - Crash fixes and speed improvements to ProTools session import
    - Allow renaming of region/source cue markers
    - Allow drag of region/source cue markers
    - Alternative region/source cue marker promotion to CD markers
    - Stop using named semaphores on system wide to avoid
      collisions with other software
    - Ignore xruns when when switching to/from non-realtime export
    - Remove duplicates in CoreAudio device list
    - Refactoring of input port monitoring (significantly reduces
      DSP load caused by new recorder tab)
    - Improvements to setting real-time priority for critical
      threads
    - Better event loop integration for websocket support
    - Automation control points no longer obey "lock edit" mode,
      which should only lock regions and notes
    - Slip-contents drag made more accessible
    - Some improvements to behavior of brush dragging
    - Override global Ubuntu menu behavior
    - Improvements to splash window visibility management during
      startup
  - Bug Fixes
    - Fix memory leak in clock displays (up to 50MB/hour when
      rolling)
    - Fix undo/redo of ripple edits
    - Fix disappearance of regions and sources from lists in the
      Editor
    - Fix behavior of "transport-play" operation from control
      surfaces
    - Fix crash during MIDI bounce with processing
    - Fixes for hangups during multiple timespan export
    - Fix crash when removing a plugin with a control mapped using
      MIDI learn or a binding map
    - Fix crash when using external position sync (MTC, LTC etc)
      and switching backends
    - Fix deadlock in long running sessions (2-5 days)

- Update to version 6.7.0.
  * New Features
    * Dedicated “Recorder” tab/window
      - Provides a compact view of your track’s record & monitor status plus a simplified timeline that keeps everything in view at once.
      - Allows you to rename your device’s hardware inputs to match your studio connections: “Vocal Mic”, “Guitar Mic”, “Bass DI” (these names will be retained across sessions).
      - Every hardware input has a high-precision meter with peak-hold, a scrolling waveform history so you can recognize your source signals, and a PFL solo button to listen to that signal (requires the Monitor section to be engaged).
      - Vision and support for this work came from Harrison Consoles.
    * New "Streaming" preset option for export (defines correct defaults for YouTube, Apple Music, SoundCloud and Amazon Music streaming services, particularly loudness levels).

    * Recover waveform-gradient-depth slider for ardour, and timeline-item-gradient-depth for mixbus.
    * Include a loudness plot on export-report.
    * Tweak export-report to fit on smaller screens (#8698).
    * Set default master-bus meter-point to output.
    * Overhaul export loudness normalization (include limiter).
    * Disambiguate export formats with same loudness but different true-peak.
    * Improve GUI behavior of the tempo dialog by preselecting the start BPM text field.
    * Use -90dB as default threshold for silence trim during export, rather than -inf dB.
    * Primary-w now closes Preferences window (like any other dialog/window).
    * Inform user if there have been dropouts during realtime export.
    * macOS: improve realtime thread scheduling.
    * Rewind/ffwd controls can now optionally act more like a shuttle (incremental) speed control (see Edit > Preferences > Transport).
    * Reduce default maximum transport speed to 2.0 to avoid DSP overload.
    * Add new config parameter for auto-return after rewind/ffwd (set to false by default).

- Update to version 6.3.0.
  * New Features
    * Loudness Analyzer & Normalizer. Calculates the Loudness 
      (LUFS) of the session (or a range selection), and add a 
      gain-stage to the master-bus to normalize the loudness 
      according to various standards. There's also an additional 
      "Conformity Check" for many common distribution targets 
      (YouTube, SoundCloud etc. etc.). Thanks to Ardour/Mixbus user
      BachStudies for the nerdsniping encouragement and design 
      ideas for this feature.

      name, to emphasize their inactive state.
    * Compile-time option to use SoundTouch for vocal time 
      stretching 
      (this is not currently enabled for ardour.org builds).

      works.
    * Dramatically speed up MIDI file loading by removing the

      with 24,134 tempo changes now takes 5 seconds instead of 5 
      minutes to load.
    * Slider controller (used in many places in the GUI) now 
      accepts dB when it controls gain, rather than a simple 
      numerical gain coefficient.
    * Do not auto-save when importing video.
    * Fix audible amplitude modulation in de-click fade.
    * If Ardour is the JACK Transport time master, it now supplies
      the bar start tick data.

      should fill the range, not stop at the end of the existing 
      MIDI content.
    * Add a take-ID to bounced regions, so that multitrack bounces 
      can be sorted/recognized in a list.
  * Bug Fixes
    * Auto-play when locating to session start is now honored 
      (again).
    * No more (small) delay when starting to record while already 
      rolling.
    * Various fixes related to auto-connecting track outputs, 
      particularly MIDI tracks.
    * AudioUnits: do not call render callback for disconnected 
      busses (fixes various 3rd party plugins).
    * Ensure audio engine is active when doing plugin scans, since 
      some 3rd party plugins try to access it (indirectly).
    * Windows version now set HiDPI settings (may fix font 
      aliasing issues on that platform).

        Improve layout/appearance/functionality of Plugin Manager dialog.
        Fixes for compatibility with LV2 1.0.0.
        Clicking on a plugin LED holding Ctrl-shift toggles all plugins/processors in this strip (except the fader).
        Fix monitoring of plugin parameter changes with LV2 and AudioUnit plugins, to avoid feedback loops between the plugin and the GUI.
        Fix an issue with loading sessions containing certain LV2 plugins.
        Show VST plugin search paths (read-only) in Preferences dialog.
        Fix LV2 plugin state for copied plugins.

        Save/restore plugin states as part of track templates.

    GUI
        Report on progress while stripping silence from tracks.
        Fix fine-adjust modifier overriding snap modifiers.
        Clicking on an already selected note when many are selected makes it the only selected note (same behaviour as regions and control points).
        Allow use of tooltips to be enabled/disabled from Preferences.
        Mixer list pane can now be shrunk to zero width.
        Dialogs and unparented windows now default to the current pointer position.
        Add relative snap when moving markers.

        Show an informational dialog when opening IRC via Help -> Chat, to try to clarify to new users that they should post a question and then wait, not leave after a few minutes.
        When adding a single plugin, immediately show the plugin GUI (except when using drag-n-drop to add the plugin).
        Improve the layout of various widgets in the Preferences dialog.
        Add "Delete all Unused Playlists" and "Keep All Playlists" options to cleanup dialog.
        Fix "Crop to Range" operation to include all (selected) regions covered by the range, not just those that cover the start.
        Fix "Fill Track" to avoid single-sample regions.
        Keep track of meter visibility.
        Hide region frame outline when region is less than 2 pixels wide.
        Continue normal scrolling if the pointer is over the dropdown menus in the track header of a MIDI track.

        Deep support for the Presonus Faderport device. This is fully documented in the Ardour Manual.

        Mackie Control devices saw a lot of subtle changes which will be documented in the manual in the near future. It is now possible to control input trim, sends and more from a Mackie surface.

        OSC:
            Allow use of broken apps such as TouchOSC and Lemur with Ardour's OSC support
            (These apps/devices violate the OSC specification by requiring all messages to include at least one argument. The new /ardour/pushbutton/.. OSC "namespace" can be used to provide OSC addresses for messages that always one floating point argument; messages to such addresses are ignored unless the argument is 1.0)

        Re-add AudioUnit cache/blacklist management.

    Linux
        ALSA backend settings now include number of playback buffers (periods), possibly using different values for playback and capture.
        LinuxVST plugins: forward window resizing events to the plugin GUI.

    Infrastructure
        Add ardour4 desktop and mime type files (for use by packagers on platforms that use them)
        Add an AppData file for GNOME packagers

- Fix suil package dependency

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Oct 18 08:34:29 UTC 2015 - ecsos@opensuse.org

- update to 4.4
  There are no 4.3 release
  - Substantive Changes/Features/Fixes
    - Fixed solo logic in deep ways. Most notably this prevents
      various "stuck solo" problems, but also a number of other
      issues with solo when using complex routing between tracks
      and busses.
    - Fixed loop recording (inadvertently broken for several
      releases).
    - Added support for RF64 and MBWF audio file formats. These are
      both 64 bit file formats, capable of recording impossibly
      large amounts of audio. MBWF is the 64 bit version of
      Broadcast WAV. .
    - When using either format, if recorded files are smaller than
      the RIFF (WAV) size limit, convert the header to RIFF so as
      to be compatible with normal WAV-handling software.
  - General Changes
    - "Save As" will refuse to write to an existing folder/directory.
    - "Save As" now defaults to the current session name as the
      name of the new session, making it easier to add suffixes or
      otherwise tweak the name.
    - Allow export of loop range without actually looping.
    - Improve CPU AVX support detection.
    - Fixed locating to current wallclock time for large time
      values.

      to video, the audio-region always stayed put and the video
      could only be moved forward.
    - Fixed various potential issues at session closing.
    - Improve error reporting from AudioEngine when trying to
      configure audio hardware.
    - Provide more details if a sessions fails to be created.
    - Improve loading speed for large sessions (1000 tracks).
    - Fixed a deadlock when removing tracks/busses and using JACK1.
    - Prevent importing files with names like "Master" or "Click"
      from causing session breakage. This also applies to attempts
      to name tracks or busses with similar names.
    - Ensure that correct audio is heard when region layering is
      changed.
    - Use a single consistent method for computing DSP load on all
      platforms, with all backends.
    - Avoid creating excessively short regions during Strip Silence
      operation.
    - Avoid possible endless loop while detecting silence.
    - Reduce chances of a bug in the OS X locale libraries from
      causing crashes.
    - Fixed duplication of multiple selected regions.
    - Correctly and consistently initialize track/bus group
      properties.
    - Fixed crash during session region cleanup.
    - Ensure identical XML in session files if the session does
      not change, thus allowing tracking state changes in a
      revision control system (e.g. git).
    - Bring Ardour's Broadcast WAVE USID value into compliance with
      EBU-R99.
    - Fixed install on systems where using su(1) changes
      directories.
    - Fixed broken onset analysis.
  - Plugins
    - Refuse to load LV2 plugins if their buffer size requirements
      cannot be satisfied.
    - Do not list LV2 plugins that cannot be used because they
      require a fixed blocksize.
    - Generally improve handling of missing plugins so that
      sessions are not damaged by the temporary unavailability of
      a plugin.
    - Fixed the position of cut/copy-and-pasted plugins.
    - Fixed AudioUnit port count, which allows loading various
      Native Instrument plugins such as Reaktor 5.
    - Added command line option to completely disable plugins.
    - Fixed handling of VST audioMasterPinConnected callback.
    - Allow loading of huge (10MB) VST plugin state.
  - GUI
    When describing keybindings below, "Primary" is used to
    describe Control on Linux and Windows, and Command on OS X
    - Fixed waveform display issues when changing waveform shape
      from rectified to normal or vice versa.
    - Added a reset option to the context menu for the shuttle
      control.
    - Allow creation of new points on a region envelope by clicking
      on the envelope line.
    - Added column titles in the list of "Recent Sessions".
    - Alter "Stop" button in the Audio/MIDI setup dialog to
      function as a "Start/Stop" button, and remove the "Apply"
      button.
    - Fixed issues where waveform display used the wrong data.
    - Cancel button for Import dialog is now a Close button.
    - Change OK button on Import dialog to "Import".
    - Correctly display plugin parameter values when dragging
      automation points/lines.
    - Fixed log-scaled automation parameter display.
    - Visually indicate regions waiting for their audio peak data
      to be generated.
    - Fixed inconsistent text sizing in the editing canvas.
    - Added avoiding GPU rendering to preferences dialog. This is
      helpful on some Linux systems with buggy video device
      drivers. See Edit > Preferences > GUI > Disable Graphics
      Hardware Acceleration.
    - Allow overriding lock-to-video when moving video or audio.
    - Fixed drawing of short cross fades.
    - Sort "Recent Sessions" by modification time.
    - Don't try to split a region when dragging.
    - Update Import dialog options when/if track selection changes.
    - Fixed marker display after a marker is removed.
    - When editing a clock display, swallow illlegal keys rather
      than passing them onto the main window where they might have
      some unintended effect.
    - Primary-Shift-click on the solo lock button now applies to
      all tracks/busses, consistent with Primary-Shift-click on
      other buttons.
    - Avoid a case where the color of selected text was the same as
      the background, making it invisible.
    - Correctly set waveform height when switching between stacked
      and overlaid view modes.
    - Make all entries in the track list context menu actually
      work.
    - Fixed incorrect setting for "Import to Region List" on first
      use of the import dialog.
    - Avoid duplicate shortcut folders in file browsers.
  - Windows
    - Drop the use of C++ fstreams to reduce issues with non-Latin
      characters in filenames on Windows.
    - Option to install without WASAPI support, which helps startup
      on Windows 10.
    - Close all files before Session > Cleanup, so that it can work
      on Windows.

    - Fixed issues with onset analysis on Windows.
    - Added "Refresh Devices" button to the Audio/MIDI setup dialog
      on Windows to pick up new
    - Added a "None" device to the PortAudio backend, allowing
      disabling either input or output, but not both.
    - devices or external ASIO buffer size changes.
  - Click/Metronome
    - Added an easy way to reset the click sound(s) to their
      defaults.
    - The click sounds are now normalized to -6dBFS.
    - Allow enabling/disabling of the click "emphasis" sound.
  - MIDI
    - MIDI Tracer window now shows MSB of appropriate messages.
    - Fixed a subtle bug in ordering of MIDI events that caused
      missing note-off messages.
    - Highlight notes based on mouse position on track header
      keyboard.
    - Exclude MIDI CC parameters with no data from being displayed
      when "Show Existing Automation" is chosen.
    - Fixed issues with linked (cloned) MIDI regions on different
      tracks.
    - Fixed issues with de-selecting MIDI notes.
    - Handle a missing MIDI file without crashing.
  - MIDI/Mackie Control Surfaces
    - Save/restore generic MIDI control surface "motorized"
      setting.
    - New Mackie Control device files for configurations with
      3 surfaces.
    - A substantial amount of work has been done on Mackie Control
      support. There is no simple summary that would describe all
      the changes, but suffice it to say that (1) it works much
      better (2) it is easier to get started (3) has been tested on
      an even wider range of equipment.
