- Update to version 0.4.4:
  + Tiny bit of love: change default template for systemd unit
    files to also contain a link to the project on github.
- Changes from version 0.4.3:
  + This release only fixes the license rendering on pypi.
- Changes from version 0.4.2:
  + Drop arrow dependency.
- Changes from version 0.4.1:
  + Release 0.4.1 but now with a package description in PyPi.
- Changes from version 0.4.0;
  + New --install feature to add systemctl timer.
- Changes from version 0.3.0:
  + A date parsing issue (#15) inspired me to revamp the
    distribution and packaging.
  + The package is no longer a single python script, but a full
    python package you will be able to install from PyPi shortly.
- Changes from version 0.2.1:
  + Prevent UnboundLocalError when --max-free is set and enough
    space free.
- Drop injected man page: upstream no longer maintains it
  apparently.
- Add python3-setuptools BuildRequires: new build dependency.

- Do not BuildRequire pandoc (as it does not exist on all
  architectures).
- Inject autotrash.1: build will fail when this needs to be
  regenerated (as pandoc would be missing).
