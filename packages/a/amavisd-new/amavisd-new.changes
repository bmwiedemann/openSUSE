-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 27 20:27:29 UTC 2023 - Peter Varkoly <varkoly@suse.com>

- update to version 2.13.0
  NEW FEATURES
  o Add support for new decoder Zstandard
  o Switch from Net::LibIDN to Net::LibIDN2.
    As Net::LibIDN (based on GNU libidn) supports only IDNA 2003 (and its
    upstream declares libidn2 as successor), the newer Net::LibIDN2 (based
    on GNU libidn2) supporting IDNA 2008 and TR46 is being used preferred,
    if available.
  o Recognize 7-Zip.org's command line utility 7zz
  o Recognize 'ACE archive' file type.
  o Add file(1) short type mapping for MS Office CDF format.
  o Add attachment file name information to structured report.
  o Introduce option to add an extra header containing the Amavis category.
  o Introduce $ip_repu_score_limit option to define an upper limit
    for the redis ip reputation score feature.
  o Make sanity limit inside macro_tests configurable.
  o Add support for SpamAssassin subjprefix keyword.
    SpamAssassin 3.4.3 introduced a subjprefix keyword and a
    _SUBJPREFIX_ template tag which may be used in SpamAssassin
    rules. The template tag is now also injected into Amavis for
    usage inside subject_tag related confvars.
  o Deprecate $daemon_group confvar by @daemon_groups, which allows
    joining multiple supplementary groups when dropping privileges.
    The first element of @daemon_groups determines the EGID.
    If $daemon_group is defined it will be put ahead implicitly.
    If @daemon_groups are empty, they default to the system-provided
    groups of $daemon_user.
  BUG FIXES
  o Ignore [$@]daemon_group(s) settings during config test
    when amavis is running unprivileged already.
  o Resolve "can't obtain a tainted string" warning.
  o Resolve start_SSL fail to set SSL_verifycn_name.
    Additionally provide an explicit choice of common names
    via %smtp_tls_client_verifycn_name_maps.
  OTHER
  o Add support for Sophos Protection for Linux on @av_scanners_backup.
  o Declare Sanesecurity.Foxhole.Mail_tar infection as false positive.
  o Factor out various Amavis packages into own module files.
  o Introduce tests via Gitlab CI.
  o Convert source to CPAN module file structure.
  o Update example scanners and documentation.
  o Add IKARUS scan.server configuration example.
  o Add contribution guideline.
  o Remove IO::Stringy dependency.
  o Add a docker-compose testing environment.
  o Add support for F-Secure Linux Security 64 on @av_scanners.

- update to version 2.12.1
  * Generate DKIM record comment line including the 's=' (selector) tag
    instead of an 'i=' (identifier) tag when using "amavisd showkeys".
  * Make sure generated Authentication-Results follow RFC specification.
  * Prevent re-encoding of notification templates.
  * Compare inode numbers as strings.
  * Resolve MySQL invalid utf8mb4 clause.
- cleanup spec
  * align (Build)Requires and Recommends with upstream 
  * rework creating vscan user (new system-user in Tumbleweed)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 26 21:43:51 UTC 2020 - Arjen de Korte <suse+build@de-korte.org>

- update to version 2.12.0
  * Upstream changed to GitLab
  * Introduce Rspamd client extension
    With this extension, Amavis can use Rspamd either running on the same
    server or remotely. Connections are made using HTTP/HTTPS depending on
    configuration, the latter requiring a HTTPS-capable proxy (like NGINX or
    Apache) for Rspamd, which does not natively support HTTPS. Basic
    authentication with name/password pairs is also available.
  * Treat "not an OLE file" as a successful result
    Amavis supports calling the ripOLE program to extract embedded objects
    from Microsoft OLE documents. However, not all Microsoft documents
    contain said objects, and the underlying file format changes when they
    do. Since Amavis can't tell the difference, it passes everything to
    ripOLE unconditionally.  Amavis now treats the "not an OLE file" error
    code of ripOLE as a successful result, proceeds normally and scans the
    file as a whole.
  * Fix unix socket path extraction that has prevented a socket based
    policy bank to be loaded;
  * Fix DKIM signing for outbound messages (remove dkim-signing.diff)
  * Fix unescaped left brace regex warning in run_av() subroutine.
  * Mention default value for $myprogram_name in minimal amavisd.conf.
- cleanup spec
  * remove unused rc.amavis SysV initscript
  * remove unused /usr/lib/tmpfiles.d

  * amavis-services: bumping up syslog level from LOG_NOTICE to LOG_ERR
    for a message "PID <pid> went away", and removed redundant newlines
    from some log messages
  * safe_decode() and safe_decode_utf8(): avoid warning messages
    "Use of uninitialized value in subroutine entry"
    in Encode::MIME::Header when the $check argument is undefined
  * @sa_userconf_maps has been extended to allow loading of per-recipient
    (or per-policy bank, or global) SpamAssassin configuration set from
    LDAP. For consistency with SQL a @sa_userconf_maps entry prefixed with
    'ldap:' will load SpamAssassin configuration set using the
    load_scoreonly_ldap() method;  a patch by Atanas Karashenski
  * add some Sanesecurity.Foxhole false positives to the default
    list @virus_name_to_spam_score_maps

- Update to version 2.11.0
  + Bugfixes
	* delivery method was undefined when always_bcc was used;
	  reported by Marieke Janssen;
	* avoid warnings issued by perl 5.21.7 and later:
	  Negative repeat count does nothing at ./amavisd line 16408
	  and similarly in amavisd-status;
	* releasing from an SQL quarantine failed to provide the original
	  envelope sender address to a released message;
	  reported, and a fix suggested by Tom Johnson and Tobias;
	* remove a stale database file __db.nanny.db on a reload or restart,
	  as it can prevent a successful start when a previous start failed
	  for some reason; a patch by Trent Lloyd;
  + Compatibility
	* During startup more detailed testing is performed for taint bugs of
	  a module Encode and the function utf8::is_utf8(), which may produce
	  warnings on old versions of perl with its old core module Encode,
	  or may exit on detecting more sinister bugs in these modules.
	  Note that the module Encode may be upgraded independently of perl,
	  if desired;
	* with MySQL: changed character set 'utf8' to 'utf8mb4' for fields
	  msgs.subject and msgs.from_addr, as previously some of the UTF-8
	  characters could not be stored in a database;
	* when logging to stderr a timestamp prefix to each message is only
	  still inserted if $DEBUG is true.  When $DEBUG is false each message
	  is prefixed with a syslog log level in angle brackets, and a timestamp
	  is omitted (for compatibility with systemd);
	* a perl module Digest::SHA is now a required module. It is a perl core
	  module since perl 5.10, so it shouldn't introduce a new dependency,
	  and it was a de-facto required module even previously, as it was needed
	  for DKIM processing;
  + New features
	* Polished rough corners to facilitate running amavisd as a non-daemonized
	  supervised process
    * A log template macro 'report_json' can now take arguments, which can
	  include or exclude fields (key/values) from the JSON report object.
	  Arguments to a macro are either field names (keys) to be included
	  in a report, or are field names to be excluded, each prefixed with
	  an exclamation mark, to produce a report with all but excluded fields.
    * Two new configuration settings are added: %smtpd_tls_server_options
	  and %smtp_tls_client_options. These two associative arrays are passed
	  to IO::Socket::SSL->start_SSL when establishing a server-side or a
	  client-side TLS session with an MTA, and provide more control over
	  a TLS session - like providing certificates and restricting ciphers.
	  See documentation of a perl module IO::Socket::SSL for a list of
	  all options with their descriptions and their defaults.
    * Supports receiving SMTP/LMTP connections through a HAProxy,
	  recognizing 'PROXY protocol Version 1' data on the first line read,
	  after a connection from HAProxy to amavisd has been established.
	  Connection data (IP addresses and ports) received via this protocol
	  end up replacing such data in the the Amavis::In::Connection object
	  ($conn).  Set configuration variable $haproxy_target_enabled (also
	  a member of policy banks) to true in order to enable this protocol.
	* redis: allow a scoped / link-local IP address specification
	  (avoiding current limitation in IO::Socket::IP [rt.cpan.org #89608]);
	* the Amavis::Unpackers::Part::digest method now holds a digest (SHA1,
	  hex) of a decoded (base64 or quoted-printable) MIME part contents,
	  followed by a colon and a lowercased Content-Type of the MIME part.
	  Canonical line endings CRLF in decoded textual parts are normalized
	  to a native newline (\n) before feeding them to a digest algorithm.
    * Policy bank names in a @client_ipaddr_policy setting can now accept
	  a comma-separated list of policy names to be loaded on a match
	  (for loading of policy banks based on an IP address of a SMTP client).
	  Whitespace around each policy name is allowed and is stripped.
	  Previously only a single policy bank name was allowed in each entry
	  of @client_ipaddr_policy.
    * Experimental feature: IP lookups (as implemented by lookup_ip_acl()
	  and used by @client_ipaddr_policy) can now also do DNS-based lookups,
	  in addition to array- and hash-based lookups.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 21 13:43:53 UTC 2016 - aj@ajaissle.de

- Add amavisd-new-2.10.1-myhostname.patch:

Wed Aug 12 14:35:24 UTC 2015 - wr@rosenauer.org

- require perl-Convert-BinHex as otherwise startup fails with
  default installation
- file based requirement does not work
  -> changed to package requirement util-linux-systemd

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec 16 20:26:10 UTC 2014 - p.drouand@gmail.com

- Update to version 2.10.1
  + fixed a missing import of mail_addr_idn_to_ascii() and idn_to_utf8()
    when SQL is in use
  + void warnings issued by perl 5.21.5:
- Changes from version 2.10
COMPATIBILITY
- New requirement: perl module Net::LibIDN needs to be installed.
- Uses a perl module File::LibMagic if installed, instead of spawning
  a file(1) utility.
- Support for international email relies heavily on perl to do the
  right thing in its support of Unicode, so using a reasonably recent
  version of perl is recommended. Amavisd was tested with perl 5.18
  and 5.20.1. Versions of perl older than 5.12 may cause problems
  with handling, encoding, and decoding of Unicode characters.
  It is reasonable to expect that versions 5.14 and 5.16 are fine too,
  but have not been tested extensively.
- Default log templates and notification templates have changed
  in details (like in decoding of international e-mail addresses), so
  if locally customized templates are in use these will benefit from
  updating - otherwise expect some mojibake in log and notifications.
- International domain names (IDN) encoded in ASCII-compatible encoding
  found in e-mail addresses and in Message-ID header field will be decoded
  to Unicode for presentation purposes (syslog, JSON structured log,
  notifications). This decoding does not affect a mail message itself.
- Logging via syslog expects that syslogd (or equivalent) will not
  clobber UTF-8 octets. It may be necessary to tell syslogd to accept
  C1 control characters unchanged, e.g. by adding a command line option
  "-8" to syslogd. Failing to do so may leave logged entries (like
  sender and recipient address, From, Subject) in international mail
  garbled or poorly readable in syslog.
  On FreeBSD one should add:  syslogd_flags="-8"  to /etc/rc.conf.
- Third party log parsers may need updating to accept logs with Unicode
  characters in UTF-8 encoding.
- A SMTP response to an EHLO command will now announce SMTPUTF8 capability
  by default.

BUG FIXES
- releasing a message from an SQL quarantine was broken in version 2.9.1
  due to introduction of parent_mail_id(); patches provided by Stef Simoens
  and Gionatan Danti;
- if checking of a message was aborted prematurely (like due to a timeout
  or some fatal error), JSON log could receive a copy of a previous
  log entry;
- prevent non-ASCII non-UTF-8 octets from reaching a JSON log/report
  (which produced an invalid JSON object and Elasticsearch complaining);
- allow SMTP commands MAIL FROM and RCPT TO to accept options without
  values, as allowed by the RFC 5321 syntax;
- in delivery status notification (DSN) the field Received-From-MTA
  specified 'smtp' as mta-name-type, instead of a 'dns' as prescribed
  in RFC 3464;
- releasing from a quarantine left envelope sender address as '<>'
  instead of using the address found in a Return-Path header field
  of a quarantined message, while also logging a warning:
    Quarantine release $QID: missing X-Envelope-From or Return-Path
  reported by Pascal Volk;
- avoid failure in os_fingerprint or in smtp forwarding in certain cases
  where the $os_fingerprint_method or $forward_method or $notify_method
  uses an asterisk in place of a host IP address or port number.
  The reported error in os_fingerprint (reported by -ben) was:
    os_fingerprint FAILED: Insecure dependency in socket
      while running with -T switch
      at /usr/lib/perl/5.18/IO/Socket.pm line 80
  and in SMTP forwarding or notification (reported by Dennis Boone):
    (!)connect to *:10025 attempt #1:
      Insecure dependency in socket while running with -T switch
      at /usr/lib/perl/5.18/IO/Socket.pm line 80.
- files LDAP.ldif and LDAP.schema: added a missing attribute
  amavisDisclaimerOptions to objectClass; reported by Quanah Gibson-Mount;

NEW FEATURES
- added support for Internationalized Email:
  * RFC 6530 - Overview and Framework for Internationalized Email
  * RFC 6531 - SMTP Extension for Internationalized Email (SMTPUTF8)
  * RFC 6532 - Internationalized Email Headers
  * RFC 6533 - Internationalized Delivery Status Notifications
  This supports UTF-8 (EAI) in SMTP/LMTP sender addresses, recipient
  addresses, and message header section. Feature parity with Postfix
  version 2.12 (support introduced in development snapshot 20140715).
  The SMTPUTF8 extension is supported by Gmail since 2014-08-05:
    http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2014/08/a-first-step-toward-more-global-email.html
- added support for Internationalized Domain Names (IDN) according
  to IDNA (RFC 5890, RFC 5891; RFC 3490);
  * A-labels in ASCII-compatible encoding of domain names are converted
    to U-labels for presentation/logging purposed;
  * U-labels are converted to A-labels when feeding a mail message
    to an MTA which does not announce support for SMTPUTF8 extension
    (instead of rejecting them as invalid mail address);
  * For lookup purposes an international domain name is converted to
    ASCII-compatible encoding when used as a query key in DNS lookups
    and in lookups into hash, list, SQL and LDAP lookup tables (but not
    in regexp table lookups). These tables are expected to contain domain
    names in their ASCII representation (ACE). For convenience of config
    files subroutines idn_to_ascii() and mail_idn_to_ascii() are available,
    which encode a Unicode domain name to ACE (like ToASCII in RFC 3490);
  * Many configuration settings may have their domain names in UTF-8.
    These will be converted to ACE automatically where necessary
    (e.g. when creating a Received and Authentication-Results header
    fields, DKIM signatures, mail addresses in notifications, ...).
    These settings include:
      $myhostname, $localhost_name, $myauthservid, $mydomain,
      notification sender and recipient mail addresses
        ($mailfrom_notify_*, $hdrfrom_notify_*, @*_admin_maps),
      domain names and selectors in DKIM signing keys (in calls
        to dkim_key() );
- delivery notifications and admin notifications now show the following
  information encoded as UTF-8 (which is a default $bdy_encoding) in the
  plain text part of the message: IDN domain names in sender and recipient
  mail addresses and Message-ID are first decoded to Unicode, Subject and
  author display names are MIME-decoded;
- 'amavisd showkeys' and 'amavisd testkeys' can now deal with IDN
  (international domain names): domain names in DNS zone comments
  end up as UTF-8, DNS labels are in ASCII (A-labels); domain names in
  calls to dkim_key() may be specified either as UTF-8 or in ASCII (ACE);
- new macro 'mail_addr_decode' takes an e-mail address as a string of
  octets, where a local part may be encoded as UTF-8, and the domain part
  may be an international domain name (IDN) consisting either of U-labels
  or A-labels or NR-LDH labels. Decodes A-labels to U-labels in domain
  name. Returns a string of logical characters (Unicode), suitable for
  notification templates. If the mail address is not a valid UTF-8 string,
  it is interpreted as ISO-8859-1 (Latin-1).
- new macro 'mail_addr_decode_octets' is like 'mail_addr_decode', except
  that the result is a string of octets, only valid as UTF-8 if the
  provided address was a valid UTF-8 (garbage-in/garbage-out);
- new macro 'header_field_octets' is like 'header_field', except that
  a result is a string of octets in UTF-8 encoding, suitable for a log
  template;
- new macro 'ip_proto_trace_all' expands into a list of information
  items from a Received header trace; each item consists of a protocol
  name (the WITH clause) and an IP address, optionally followed by a
  source port number if known;
  Example:
    ESMTP://[2001:db8::143:1]:39141 < ESMTP://2001:db8::25 <
      esmtps://203.0.113.172 < ESMTPSA://192.168.9.9
  or:
    UTF8SMTP://[203.0.113.172]:51208 < UTF8SMTPSA://192.168.9.9
- new macro 'ip_proto_trace_public' is like ip_proto_trace_all, except
  that entries with non-public IP address are excluded from the list;
  'Received' trace information in $log_verbose_templ and in notifications
  now include results from this macro call;
- new macro 'protocol' evaluates to a protocol name by which a message
  was received by amavisd, according to RFC 3848 ("Transmission Types
  Registration") and "Mail Transmission Types" / "WITH protocol types"
  IANA registration
    http://www.iana.org/assignments/mail-parameters/mail-parameters.xhtml
  e.g.: SMTP, ESMTP, ESMTPA, ESMTPS, ESMTPSA, LMTP, LMTPA, LMTPS, LMTPSA,
        UTF8SMTP, UTF8SMTPA, UTF8SMTPS, UTF8SMTPSA,
        UTF8LMTP, UTF8LMTPA, UTF8LMTPS, UTF8LMTPSA, ...
- new macro 'client_protocol' expands into a protocol name by which
  a message was received from a client by MTA; the information is passed
  from MTA to amavisd through XFORWARD PROTO SMTP protocol extension or
  through AM.PDP (milter); typical values are 'ESMTP' or 'SMTP';
- use a perl module File::LibMagic when available, instead of spawning
  a file(1) utility for classifying contents of mail parts.
  By using a direct interface to a libmagic library the startup cost
  of spawning an external process is avoided. Benchmarking shows that
  using libmagic is significantly faster especially for checking a small
  number of files - takes 4 ms for checking one file with libmagic
  vs. 27 ms with a spawned file(1); based on a patch by Markus Benning;


OTHER
- RFC 6533: recognize a MIME type 'message/global' as similar
  to 'message/rfc822', and 'message/global-headers' as similar
  to 'text/rfc822-headers' where appropriate (e.g. in bounce killer);

- header validity check now distinguishes 'non-ASCII and invalid UTF-8'
  from 'non-ASCII but valid UTF-8' characters in a mail header section.
  By default valid UTF-8 strings in a mail header section are not treated
  as error even if mail is not flagged as international mail (SMTPUTF8),
  as these are quite common in practice. To treat non- MIME-encoded UTF-8
  in a header section as error the test can be enabled by:
    $allowed_header_tests{'utf8'} = 1;
- ORCPT attribute in SMTP 'RCPT TO' command now accepts the original
  recipient mail address in any of these encodings: utf-8-address,
  utf-8-addr-unitext, utf-8-addr-xtext, or as a legacy xtext,
  as required by RFC 6533;
- updated do_cabextract (extraction of Microsoft cabinet .cab archives)
  to recognize a slightly changed output of cabextract version 1.2;
  patch by Thomas Jarosch;
- adjusted some timeouts to leave more reserve for later stages of
  mail processing and forwarding;
- prefer sanitizing/protecting control characters as hex code (like \x7F)
  instead of octal (like \177) (e.g. in logging and DSN);
- Use dowload Url as source
- Add a requirement on perl-Net-LibIDN; new upstream dependency

Sun Jul 27 15:35:21 UTC 2014 - wr@rosenauer.org

- update to version 2.9.1
  COMPATIBILITY
  There are no known incompatibilities between versions 2.9.0 and 2.9.1.

  Additional bugfixes and also:
  - updated decoding of RAR archives to recognize a changed format in output
    of 'unrar' utility version 5; based on a patch by amavis17(at)iotti.biz
  - avoid tempfailing a message if a redis server is down, just log the
    error and carry on;
  - some minor logging changes to facilitate troubleshooting;
- changes in 2.9
  COMPATIBILITY
  This version drops dependency on a Perl module Redis, and makes
  dependencies on modules Convert::TNEF and Convert::UUlib truly optional.
  The following change may affect third-party log parsers:
  To facilitate forensic log analysis and troubleshooting, log entries
  'FWD from' and 'SEND from' at level 1 now carry one additional
  prefixed information field which is the unique internal mail_id of
  the message, possibly followed by a parent_mail_id in parenthesis,
  No other incompatibilities with a previous version 2.8.1 are expected.

  NEW FEATURES SUMMARY
  - structured log/reporting to a Redis server in JSON format;
  - IP address reputation (uses a Redis server);
  - added two minor content categories to the major ccat CC_UNCHECKED
    (encrypted (=1) and over-limits/mail-bomb (=2) );
  - introduced a by-recipient setting %final_destiny_maps_by_ccat.
- update amavisd-milter to 1.6.0
  * New features:
    Added new amavisd-milter option -B which passes value of
    {daemon_name} milter macro as amavisd-new policy bank name.
  * Bug and compatibility fixes:
    Added amavisd-milter.spec for compilation with rpmbuild.
    Fixed typo which prevents using LDFLAGS on Debian.
    Fixed missing definition of true and false in libmilter/mfapi.h.
- upstream packages as tar.xz -> added xz as BuildRequires to
  support building for older dists

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Sep 14 18:40:10 UTC 2013 - wr@rosenauer.org

- update to version 2.8.1
  COMPATIBILITY
  when 0MQ (a.k.a. ZeroMQ) is used between Amavis components as an
  internal messaging protocol, make sure to replace all 0MQ-enabled
  Amavis components on upgrading amavisd, as the internal protocol
  has changed slightly, taking advantage of 0MQ multi-part messages
  for better performance. Affected programs are: amavis-services,
  amavisd-status, amavisd-snmp-subagent-zmq, and amavisd.

  NOTE: The Crossroads I/O project (libxs) ceased development on
    July 2012, to be replaced by nanomsg eventually by the same author.

    The 0MQ library (libzmq) is currently (2013) the best choice,
    the preferred library version is 3.2.2 or later along with
    the ZMQ::LibZMQ3 Perl interface module and ZMQ::Constants.
    The older version 2 of the library, along with an older perl
    module ZeroMQ, should be fine too, but lacks support for IPv6.

  amavisd is compatible with perl 5.18.0 and with SpamAssassin 3.4.0

  NEW FEATURES SUMMARY
  * new Redis storage for the "pen pals" feature;
  * improved IPv6 support;
  * support for p0f v3;
  * new macros ip_trace_all and ip_trace_public;
  * amavisd-status now shows a bar graph display
    of the number of active processes;
  * the timing report log entry can show CPU usage
    at log level 2 if a module Unix::Getrusage is available;

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb  6 08:52:23 UTC 2013 - aj@ajaissle.de

- update to version 2.8.0

- COMPATIBILITY 2.8.0
  * removed an old compatibility measure: default value of @banned_admin_maps
    was changed from:
      @banned_admin_maps = (\$banned_admin, \%virus_admin, \$virus_admin);
    to a more consistent:
      @banned_admin_maps = (\$banned_admin);
    The previous default value of @banned_admin_maps tried to maintain
    compatibility with versions before the setting was separated from
    its companion @virus_admin_maps. Now this compatibility is no longer
    considered necessary and contributes to some confusion, so it was dropped.
    See 2.4.0 and 2.2.1 release notes for previous changes to this setting.
  * quarantining to an mbox format file used to include a local time in an
    mbox separator line, which differs from RFC 4155 and common practices
    of using an UTC timestamp; a time zone of a timestamp in separator lines
    is now changed to UTC;

- BUG FIXES 2.8.0
  * fixed initial evaluation of dynamic (i.e. per policy bank) values of
    $enable_dkim_verification, $enable_dkim_signing and $bypass_decode_parts
    across all declared policy banks; these policy bank entries may be scalars
    of references to such;
  * finely adjust a message size for de-stuffed dots according to a size
    definition in RFC 1870; avoids occasional message size mismatch when
    using an antispam interface module SpamdClient (implementing client-side
    of a spamc/spamd protocol);
  * updated LDAP.ldif to match LDAP.schema; provided by Quanah Gibson-Mount;
  * updated AMAVIS-MIB.txt and amavisd-snmp-subagent: changed type of
    SNMP variables *MsgsSize* in the group amavisStats 7 from Counter32
    to Counter64 for consistency with other *MsgsSize* variables in groups
    amavisStats 3 and amavisStats 9;

- NEW FEATURES SUMMARY 2.8.0
  * For monitoring and statistics gathering purposes a new set of utilities
    and service processes is available based on a message passing paradigm,
    using a 0MQ (a.k.a. ZMQ, ZeroMQ, or Crossroads I/O) library. This
    replaces a functionally similar set of utilities based on a shared
    BerkeleyDB database, with a benefit of avoiding lock contention
    altogether. This can bring sigificant speedups, most pronounced on
    a host with many busy amavisd child processes.
  * Applied numerous fine-grained optimizations based on a NYTProf profiler
    results. Optimizations include a reduction in a number of generated
    Perl opcodes and similar micro-optimizations. This accounts for a large
    amount of small changes in the code.
  * Our current statistics (Q4 2011) shows that 80 % of messages are below
    30.000 bytes, and 90 % of mail messages are below 100.000 bytes in
    size. As an optimization, messages below 100 KiB in size are now kept
    and processed in memory, including passing them more optimally to
    SpamAssassin 3.4.0. Some file activity is still there, but is much
    reduced. If $TEMPBASE also resides on an SSD disk (or a RAM disk),
    observed speedup between 2.7.2 and 2.8.0 was 3 to 8 percent on a
    busy host (with monitoring disabled, so as not to skew a measurement).
  * Use a module IO::Socket::IP if available, instead of dealing directly
    with low-level modules IO::Socket::INET and IO::Socket::INET6;
  * choose more appropriate defaults if running on an IPv6-only host
    (like connecting to ::1 instead of 127.0.0.1 which may not exist);
  * amavisd-release now also supports connecting to amavisd over IPv6;
  * as a debugging aid it is now possible that a late event triggers full
    logging of earlier events that occurred during processing of a current
    mail message;
  * $enable_ldap setting is now dynamic, i.e. can be changed by a policy
    bank, which makes it possible to selectively disable LDAP lookups
    per policy bank;
  * optionally avoid persistent connections to SQL and LDAP servers;
  * it is now possible to disable calling an external file(1) utility
    but still have MIME parts decoding enabled;
  * added support in Amavis::SpamControl::ExtProg for an external spam scanner
    Bogofilter;
  * added locking options to @spam_scanners entries, to be used with external
    scanners which need but do not implement locking of their resources
    by themselves;
  * added a global configuration setting $sa_userprefs_file, which is passed
    on to SpamAssassin as a 'userprefs_filename' parameter at initialization;
  * added a subroutine iso8601_weekday(), potentially useful with partitioning;
  * added several new macros available to logging and notification templates;


-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec 27 23:29:51 UTC 2012 - wr@rosenauer.org

- update to version 2.7.2
  * a generated Received header field was missing the 'IPv6:' prefix
    in the TCP-info component of a 'by' subfield (as required by RFC 5321,
    section 4.1.3) when amavisd received a message over an IPv6 protocol;
    (btw, the TCP-info component of a 'from' subfield was correct);
  * changed data type of an SNMP variable LogRetries from C32 to C64
    for consistency with the MIB;
  * updated AV entry 'AVG Anti-Virus' to consider status 403 continuation
    lines when searching for a virus name; suggested by Ralf Hildebrandt;
  * reduce a log level to 5 on a log message:
    Amavis::IO::RW: Error flushing on close: ...
    to avoid an innocent but sinister-looking warning when a pipe
    to a virus scanner is broken and needs to be re-established;
    reported by Stefan Jakobs
  * updated an AV entry for 'F-Secure Linux Security' to version 9.14;
    options updated by Mika Ilmaranta, a patch by Tuomo Soini;
  * fix a Unix socket compatibility issue with Net::Server versions 2.000,
    2.001 and 2.002, where a method NS_unix_path no longer exists.
    This method was re-introduced for compatibility reasons in 2.003.

- update to 2.7.0 With a synergy of four solutions, using amavisd-new
  in a pre-queue filtering setup became a sensible / better behaved solution:

  - old helper programs amavis.c and amavis-milter.c are no longer distributed
    with the package, along with the whole helper-progs subdirectory.
    As a milter client please use the more modern 'amavisd-milter' package by
    Petr Rehor, available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/amavisd-milter/

  - the "smtpd_proxy_options=speed_adjust" Postfix option, available since
    Postfix 2.7.0 (20091101), improves decoupling between SMTP clients
    and a content filter in a proxy setup, reducing the number of content
    filtering processes needed for the same mail load. With this option
    turned on, a Postfix SMTP server receives the entire message before
    connecting to a before-queue content filter;
  
  - a master_deadline option and its API equivalent, available in SpamAssassin
    since version 3.3.0, allows for time limiting on lengthy rules checking,
    while still providing results when a time limit is exceeded; this makes
    it more suitable for time-sensitive setups like a pre-queue filtering setup;
  
  - reworked sub-task time limiting in amavisd, along with its counterpart
    solution in SpamAssassin, makes it better suited to a real-time nature
    of pre-queue filtering setups, where one has no control over how long
    SMTP clients are willing to wait at the data-end stage;
  
  - a re-purposed command line option 'reload' now does a warm restart,
    keeping sockets available to an MTA client at all times, thus reducing
    a chance that an MTA would even notice a content filter's warm restart.

Tue May 24 08:02:50 UTC 2011 - varkoly@suse.de

- update to 2.6.6
 - amavisd-release was not sending a 'mail_file' attribute when a quarantined
  message was a non-compressed file in a single-level directory quarantine

- quarantining to SQL was sporadically failing, reporting some unrelated
  random error (like 'not available' or 'OpenSSL error: header too long');

- avoid a warning "_WARN: Use of uninitialized value in string eq at ...
  line 275." when an SQL-based white/black-listing is used;

- wrap the sql clause  SET NAMES 'utf8'  so that only a warning at
  a log level 2 is issued if an SQL server does not understand the
  command (SQLite, old versions of MySQL) instead of aborting;
 
- when a back-end MTA rejected a message, amavisd would send a non-delivery
  status notification, but also propagate the reject status back, which is
  wrong, only one or the other response would be appropriate. A fix also
  allows choosing either a D_REJECT, D_BOUNCE or D_DISCARD response for
  such a case, configurable through %final_destiny_by_ccat at a CC_MTA
  entry, defaulting to D_REJECT;

- bnc#521366 - Amavisd-new sends bounces when it isn't allowed to do so (backscatter!)
- update to 2.6.4
BUG FIXES

- amavisd failed to start when spam scanning was disabled either
  by @bypass_spam_checks_maps=(1) or by @spam_scanners=(), giving:
    Can't locate object method "new" via package "Amavis::SpamControl"
- several decoders failed to propagate "Exceeded storage quota" exception,
  so the protection of AV scanners against mail bombs was ineffective;
- milter usage (AM.PDP): verbatim header edits inserted a header body of "1"
  instead of the correct string, for example: "Authentication-Results: 1";
- updated AV entry for BitDefender's bdscan to recognize tabs around a colon
  in its output; contributed by Steve;
- fix parsing of a combined result from DSPAM (option --classify), as
  earlier versions of DSPAM did not include a signature with a combined
  result line;
- when logging to SQL (pen pals), the msgs.message_id field always received
  a value '1' instead of a Message-Id, thus making pen pals less effective
  (only matching on sender/recipient pairs worked, not on message threads)
  and letting some bounces bypass a bounce killer; bug was introduced with
  version 2.6.2;
- timer was not reset after a persistent failure to connect to a daemonized
  virus scanner, so a subsequent call to a backup scanner only had 10 seconds
  available before it was aborted, which was often too short for a command
  line backup scanner like clamscan;
- if a virus scanner interface did not find a name of a virus in the output
  of a virus scanner (despite noticing infection), the infection was ignored;
- added missing /m flags to regular expressions in AV entries
  (a bug is revealed with Perl 5.10.0; previous versions of Perl happened
  to work, unintentionally accepting a /m flag if added late during a regexp
  evaluation);
- $banned_namepath_re setting only worked globally, but was not usable in
  policy banks;
- do_uncompress: signal run_command_copy() errors, instead of returning a
  status, thus allowing decompose_part() to detect 'Exceeded storage quota'
  or 'Maximum number of files exceeded', and flag mail as CC_UNCHECKED;
- if $mailfrom_notify_admin was not specified in a configuration file but
  defaulted to an e-mail address in $hdrfrom_notify_admin, the following
  was reported (due to missing angle brackets) on an attempt to submit
  a notification:
    (!)SEND via SMTP: virusalert@example.com -> <virusalert@example.com>...
        501 5.1.7 Bad sender address syntax
    (!)FAILED to notify admin: 501 5.1.7 Failed, id=40690-23,
      from MTA([::1]:10027): 501 5.1.7 Bad sender address syntax
  Notification was not sent, the rest of the processing was unaffected;
- fetch_modules: only suppress the "Can't locate ... in @INC" diagnostics
  if exactly the requested module is missing, but do show the error if some
  subordinate module is missing and preventing the requested module to be
  loaded;
- do_unrar: recognize an information line with a '<->';
- fixed a syntax error in LDAP.ldif;
- fixed a bug in SpamdClient;

NEW FEATURES SUMMARY
- provide a true SNMP agent and a MIB, facilitating monitoring the health
  of a content filtering system, its performance and mail characteristics;
- a new AV interface to SMTP-based antivirus scanners;
- allow customizing SMTP-status response reason text for blocked messages;
- prevent inserting fake copies of certain important mail header fields
  without breaking a DKIM signature;
- added a configuration variable @client_ipaddr_policy, which maps smtp
  client's IP address lookup lists to a policy bank name. This allows for
  loading a policy bank based on a client IP address, and generalizes a
  formerly hard-wired mapping of @mynetworks_maps into 'MYNETS'.
- large messages beyond $sa_mail_body_size_limit are now partially passed
  to SpamAssassin and other spam scanners for checking: a copy passed to
  a spam scanner is truncated near or slightly past the indicated limit.
  Large messages are no longer given an almost free passage through spam
  checks.
- supports passing an extra argument suppl_attrib to $spamassassin->parse,
  as recognized by SpamAssassin 3.3.0, passing a set of DKIM signature
  objects to a SpamAssassin's plugin DKIM, which saves having to do the
  same signature verification operation again within a plugin, and provides
  uncrippled signatures to SpamAssassin even when a large message is
  truncated by amavisd and only partially submitted to spam analysis;
- add global variables $sa_configpath and $sa_siteconfigpath (undef by
  default), which are passed to SpamAssassin as options 'rules_filename'
  and 'site_rules_filename' during its initialization call; this makes
  it easier to run multiple instances of amavisd, each with a different
  SpamAssassin configuration, using the same amavisd configurations file
  by taking advantage of option -i;  suggested by Noah Baker;
- report process resource usage at log level 2 by calling getrusage(1)
  if a perl module Unix::Getrusage is available;

  BUG FIXES
  - avoid a bounce-killer's false positive when a message is multipart/mixed
    with an attached message/rfc822 (looking like a qmail or a MSN bounce)
    and having attached a message with a foreign Message-ID - by restricting
    the check to messages with an empty sender address or a 'postmaster' or

    return status, or even cause a read-access violation;
  - dsn_cutoff_level was ignored if SpamAssassin was not invoked (e.g. on
    large messages) even if recip_score_boost was nonzero, causing a DSN
    not to be suppressed for internally generated large score values;

- Bug 230822  Amavisd-release Misconfiguration

- update to version 2.5.1

SECURITY

- provides checking the number of archive members against $MAXFILES quota
  even when just listing an archive directory, providing some additional
  protection (besides a time limit) against runaway dearchivers
  (such as a recent Zoo archiver DoS);

- please use the most recent versions of file(1) utility (currently 4.21)
  and recent versions of external dearchivers/decoders to avoid known
  security vulnerabilities in them;


NEW FEATURES

- introduced a variation of a message release from a quarantine, allowing
  a releaser to choose between forwarding a message to the back-end MTA
  port as usual (avoiding re-checking of a message), or to send it to MTA
  on its incoming port (normally 25) and let the message be rescanned,
  which might be useful after adjusting spam rules or antivirus database.

  It is implemented by:

    * adding a configuration variable $requeue_method (also a member
      of policy banks), with a default value: 'smtp:[127.0.0.1]:25'

    * extending the AM.PDP protocol with a 'request=requeue' attribute
      which can be used in place of a 'request=release',

    * enhancing the 'amavisd-release' utility program to choose between
      sending 'request=release' and 'request=requeue' based on its
      program name, i.e. by making a soft or hard link to amavisd-release
      (or its copy) named 'amavisd-requeue', the utility will send
      a 'request=requeue' in place of the usual 'request=release', e.g.:
        # ln -s amavisd-release amavisd-requeue
        $ amavisd-requeue spam/k/kg2P0rP9Lpu3.gz

    * enhancing amavisd daemon to choose between forwarding a released
      message either to $release_method or to $requeue_method destination
      based on a 'request' attribute value in an AM.PDP request;

- new AV entry: ArcaVir for Linux and Unix, see below for links;

- a new macro 'supplementary_info' gives access to some additional information
  provided by content scanners, such as a provided by SpamAssassin API
  routine get_tag. The macro takes two arguments, the first is a tag name
  (a name of some attribute which is expected to provide an associated
  value), the second argument is a sprintf format string and is optional,
  if missing a %s is assumed. Currently the only available attributes are
  AUTOLEARN, SC, SCRULE, SCTYPE, and RELAYCOUNTRY. These are nonempty only
  when an associated SpamAssassin plugin or function is enabled.

BUG FIXES

- fixed quarantining to a SQL database of messages with a null envelope
  sender address (broken in 2.5.0, causing such messages to tempfail);
  reported by Markus Edholm, Vahur Jõlu and Michael Scheidell;

- fixed parsing of certain broken 'From' header fields, which would
  result in a temporary failure and the following logged error:
    check_init2 FAILED: parse_address_list PANIC1 53
      at /usr/local/sbin/amavisd line 3292
  reported by Michael Scheidell;

- avoid encoding nonprintable characters in X-Envelope-From and X-Envelope-To
  header fields in a quarantined message even if envelope mail addresses
  contain such invalid characters, so that a quarantine release is possible;
  (RFC 2047 allows encoding of a 'phrase' in From, To, and similar headers,
  as well as in comments, but not in the address specification);

- avoid unnecessarily RFC 2047 -encoding of 8-bit characters in those
  lines of inserted X-Spam-Report (and similar) multiline header fields
  which only contain ASCII characters; also avoid encoding of newlines;
  reported by Anant Nitya;

- properly recognize PostgreSQL error code 'S8006' and reconnect to
  a disconnected server right away; thanks to Brian Wong;

- call $mail_obj->finish after a SA call to allow for garbage collection
  and removal of SA temporary files;  see:
    http://issues.apache.org/SpamAssassin/show_bug.cgi?id=5444

- avoid nonstandard SMTP status code 254 on discarded malware;
  on discarding turn status 554 into a 250 instead;  violation
  of a SHOULD in RFC 2822 pointed out by Alexander Bergolth;

- an informational log message was reported inappropriately:
    INFO: truncated ... header line(s) longer than 998 characters
  it didn't reflect reality, it was always reported together with the:
    INFO: unfolded 1 illegal all-whitespace continuation lines

- when a SMTP option BODY=8BITMIME (RFC 1652) is not given on mail
  reception, avoid turning it on while forwarding even if mail body
  contains 8-bit characters;  following a garbage-in-garbage-out
  principle, this doesn't break anything that isn't already broken,
  but might prevent later conversion to 7-bit quoted-printable MIME
  by some downstream MTA, possibly preventing signature invalidations
  (DKIM, S/MIME, PGP, ...) - at a risk that some overzealous firewall
  might block a mail transfer;

- fixed a couple of documentation typos/bugs in README.customize
  amavisd-new-2.5.0 release notes

COMPATIBILITY WITH 2.4.5

  The 2.5.0 is upwards compatible with 2.4.* versions. 
    
  Nevertheless, default notification and logging templates are
  enhanced to take advantage of new macros and new concepts,
  so it is prudent to update templates if defaults are overridden,
  e.g. $log_templ, $notify_*_admin_templ, ...
  
NEW FEATURES AT A GLANCE

- new concept: blocking contents category; 
  
- true per-recipient defanging/sanitation of a mail body (previously
  a true per-recipient handling was available for mail header edits,
  but not for mail body modifications);
  
- added interface code to invoke Anomy Sanitizer or the 'altermime' program
  allows defanging or adding disclaimers by external utilities on a
  per-recipient basis;

- rewritten SMTP client code: get rid of the troublesome module Net::SMTP;
  new code now supports pipelining, client-side LMTP, IPv6, Unix sockets,
  more reliable error handling, passes on ORCPT parameter, passes on ENVID
  parameter unmangled, is bare-CR-clean, tidier code (no workarounds for
  rough corners in Net::SMTP), fewer context switches (handshake handovers)
  due to pipelining if pipelining is offered by MTA (which usually is);
  
- makes available pedantically parsed addresses from a mail header:
  From, Sender, To, Cc.  Addresses from mail header may be needed for
  deciding on inserting disclaimers, signing mail (DKIM), custom hooks
  (like 'vacation'-type applications), and other future applications.
  Get rid of inexact parsing by module Mail::Address, provide own parser;
  
- phishing fraud as returned by ClamAV is now treated as spam, no longer
  as a virus;
  
- compatible with SpamAssassin 3.2.0;
  
- enhancements to amavisd-nanny: shows more detailed states of processes;

- enhancements to amavisd-agent: shows average processing times per message;
  
- extended AM.PDP protocol with an attribute 'policy_bank' which may be used
  in a client's request to require loading additional policy banks;
  
- add support for 7-Zip archives if external utility 7z is available;

- custom hooks allow custom code to be called at few strategic places;
  
- penpals can now also match replies which reference previous outgoing mail
  by its MessageID (taking into account References or In-Reply-To header
  field); 

- new key 'originating' in policy banks generalizes a MYNETS policy bank;
  
- a documentation rewrite for setting up amavisd-new with Postfix
  by Patrick Ben Koetter (one of the two authors of The Book of Postfix).
  Previous documentation has been renamed to README.postfix.old and will be
  removed in the next version; the new documentation is README.postfix.html,
  and its automatically converted plain text version is README.postfix.

BUG FIXES

- if a sender is both white- and black-listed at the same time, then
  inserted X-Spam-* header fields were inconsistent, e.g. X-Spam-Level,
  X-Spam-Flag and X-Spam-Status reflected a whitelisted status (no asterisks,
  not a spam), while X-Spam-Score showed 64 points; now whitelisting prevails
  in all X-Spam-* header fields;

- relax argument parsing in amavisd-release to allow releasing of
  quarantine id containing a body hash in a name (%b in template);
  reported by Ron Rademaker;

- skip a SQL-logging database operation if an associated clause in %sql_clause
  is disabled, e.g. set to undef or '';  this allows for example to selectively
  disable SQL logging based on a policy bank; thanks to Riaan Kok;

- let LHA decoder (do_lha) recognize also other listing formats, e.g. MS-DOS,
  symlinks, not just plain Unix archives; problem reported by Ryuhei Funatsu;

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar  8 14:58:24 CET 2007 - varkoly@suse.de

- update to version 2.4.5

SECURITY

- Recommended version of Convert::UUlib is 1.08 or higher
  to avoid processing of uninitialized data containing 'random' garbage.

  Note that a security hole in uulib which comes with Convert::UUlib 1.04
  and older is now (as of 2006-12-05) known to be exploitable:
    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-1349
  credits to Jean-Sébastien Guay-Leroux;

- p0f-analyzer.pl will no longer reply to queries coming from low-numbered
  UDP ports below 1024 or from nfsd port 2049, and will ignore queries
  with nonce longer than 1024 character or containing characters outside
  of \040-\177 range to limit its usefulness as a potential reflector
  for an attacker from internal networks.


INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE WITH 2.4.4

- p0f-analyzer.pl now only binds to a loopback interface by default, instead
  of to all interfaces;  change $bind_addr in p0f-analyzer.pl to '0.0.0.0'
  if p0f-analyzer.pl is running on a different host from amavisd or from
  other querying clients; suggested by Shaun T. Erickson and Mario Liehr;


BUG FIXES

- let p0f-analyzer.pl exit when a pipe on stdin is closed (e.g. when p0f
  is killed or crashes), instead of entering a tight loop; reported by
  Justin Piszcz and Henrik Krohns;

- hard-blacklisting no longer skips quarantining when
  $spam_quarantine_cutoff_level is undefined (or is an empty string);

- restart timer after Sophie times out; previously the next attempt
  would run with no time limit; reported by Nick Leverton and
  Nicklas Bondesson;

- fixed AM.PDP code to always provide smtp-quoted form in angle brackets
  in delrcpt and addrcpt attributes of a response, i.e. in the same form
  as was received in sender and recipient attributes;

- fix error reporting in open_on_specific_fd when POSIX::dup2 fails;
  thanks to Chris (decoder);

- fix signal handling in read_snmp_variables() and register_proc(),
  a signal could previously get lost (not re-signaled) if it occurred
  within these subroutines;

- fixed get_body_digest which incorrectly determined 7- or 8-bitness
  of mail header and body, setting body_type incorrectly (with only
  cosmetic ill-effects);

- AM.PDP protocol: ensure proper address form is used in server response
  attributes 'delrcpt' and 'addrcpt': the same form should be used as
  in 'sender' and 'recipient' attributes. The attribute value syntax is
  specified in RFC 2821 as 'Reverse-path' (i.e. smtp-quoted form, enclosed
  in <>); previously enclosing angle brackets were missing in a server reply;

- documentation - amavisd.conf-default incorrectly stated that a default
  value for $prepend_header_fields_hdridx is 1;  actually the default is 0
  as correctly indicated in release notes; reported by Jo Rhett;

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct 20 11:13:22 CEST 2006 - varkoly@suse.de

- update to version 2.4.3 

BUG FIXES AND WORKAROUNDS

- fixed a bug (introduced with amavisd-new-2.4.0): when receiving mail
  from MTA through a LMTP protocol (not SMTP) and with D_BOUNCE as a
  final*destiny setting, a suppressed non-delivery notification (e.g.
  spam above cutoff_level) did not turn LMTP status into a success,
  so an undesired bounce was generated by MTA in a post-queue filtering
  setup, contributing to excessive bounce backscatter; reported by
  Michael Scheidell, thanks to Gary V for analysis;

- bug fix to amavisd-release: a regexp needs to be relaxed to allow
  quarantine names like Y/spam-Y5y7A3J5r2Ax.gz, reported by Rob Chanter;

- fix a bug in LDAP lookups which could lead to an infinite loop while
  expanding %m in the filter; reported by Petr Vokac;

- add "LOCAL_STATE_DIR => '/var/lib'" to the SA object initialization
  for versions of SA 3.1.4 or older, so that SpamAssassin would see
  additional rules provided by sa-update and placed to its default location;
  the SA 3.1.5 provides its own default so this becomes unnecessary;

- bug fix: don't reject mail when mail size restriction is in force,
  the limit is exceeded, and $final_destiny_by_ccat{+CC_OVERSIZED}
  is not D_REJECT;

- treat blacklisting like high spam score when considering suppressing
  quarantining (@spam_quarantine_cutoff_level_maps) or suppressing sending
  a DSN (@spam_dsn_cutoff_level_maps);

- calling do_quarantine() multiple times on the same message would accumulate
  header edits from each invocation, fixed;  (such situation can only happen
  with a modified program);

- when defanging mail or releasing mail from a quarantine, with a goal
  of not breaking DKIM Sender Signing Policy and DomainKeys policy,
  do not copy existing Sender header field to a new header, and insert
  our own Sender field (configurable by %hdrfrom_notify_recip_by_ccat);

  Note that dk-milter-0.4.1 (dk-filter) incorrectly signs mail released by
  amavisd from a quarantine - presence of X-Spam-* header fields preceded
  and followed by Received header fields makes dk-filter inappropriately
  reorder headers fields before signing. The dkim-milter works correctly.
  The bug has been reported, but has not yet been resolved at this time.

- explicitly set PerlIO layer to ":bytes" on a temporary file handle for
  email.txt (just in case); based on a problem report by Alexander Schäfer;

- in a string produced by a macro %c remove a decimal dot if score happens
  to be an integer;

- reduce $sa_mail_body_size_limit from 512 kB to 400 kB in amavisd.conf
  and amavisd.conf-sample for the time being, while the SA folks work
  on http://issues.apache.org/SpamAssassin/show_bug.cgi?id=5041
  (MS Outlook Express seems to be chopping long mail in approx 500 kB chunks);

- another workaround for Perl taint bug: IO::Handle::_open_mode_string
  taints the $1 when mode string to IO::File::open is '+<', use O_RDWR
  instead; thanks to Ryan Frantz;

- abort if a specified syslog facility name is unknown, instead of
  switching to LOG_DAEMON as before;

- change the code which selects defanging so that defanging is triggered
  if any applicable contents category of a message chooses defanging;
  counterintuitive behaviour reported by Tapani Tarvainen;

- fix example in amavisd.conf-sample to use +CC_SPAM instead of CC_SPAM
  as a key to a hash, e.g. $final_destiny_by_ccat{+CC_SPAM}, otherwise Perl
  would implicitly turn CC_SPAM into a string when used in such a context.

  Note that any Perl expression syntax would do, as long as the argument
  does not look like a plain variable which receives implicit quoting;
  possibilities include $xx{&CC_SPAM}, $xx{+CC_SPAM}, $xx{CC_SPAM()},
  $xx{(CC_SPAM)} and similar; a more obvious &CC_SPAM is avoided because
  it prevents subroutine call inlining optimization in Perl;

- qmail: update amavisd-new-qmqpqq.patch to be compatible with Net::Server
  version 0.91 or later; thanks to mr from DBA Lab S.p.A.;

- AM.PDP protocol: change the order of attributes returned in an reply:
  delete and edit header fields before adding new header fields;
  problem of deleting just-inserted header fields in a sendmail milter
  setup reported by Petr Rehor;

- AM.PDP protocol change - with version 2 of the protocol the following
  changes to the protocol were made:
  * "version_server=2" is provided in a server response as the
    first attribute, older versions did not provide such attribute
    (assumed version on the server side was 1);
  * delheader and chgheader now stand in a response before insheader
    and addheader, assuming that milter MTA will execute these
    in the same order;
  * new attribute: "insheader=hdridx hdr_head hdr_body"
    (where hdridx as used by amavisd will always be 0 for now), making
    it possible to prepend header fields in a sendmail milter setup
    (instead of appending them, breaking compatibility with DomainKeys);
    problem noted by Adam Gibson and Petr Rehor;
  * new attribute: "quarantine=reason"
    place message on hold or to a quarantine maintained by MTA, and supply
    a reason text (e.g. client may call smfi_quarantine milter routine);
    For future use - it is currently (2.4.3 or earlier) never used.

- new feature: "pen pals soft-whitelisting" lowers spam score of received
  replies to a message previously sent by a local user to this address;
- new feature: added command line options to override certain configuration
  settings from a config file, see below;
- documentation bug fixes, especially on the use of SQL data type TIMESTAMP;
- zoo decoder interface routine can now use utility unzoo(1) or zoo(1);

- LDAP.schema: add missing LDAP attribute amavisSpamQuarantineCutoffLevel
  to the list of allowed attributes in objectclass amavisAccount;
  pointed out by Paolo Cravero;


-  Delivery status notifications (DSN) are now supported, both as a SMTP
  protocol extension and in notifications. Header fields like X-Amavis
  and X-Spam are now prepended to mail header for DomainKeys compatibility.
  Configuration variables can be chosen based on mail contents category,
  which is now represented explicitly. A built-in macro expander is enhanced,
  providing new macros and call types. Added support for passive operating
  system fingerprinting with the use of p0f, supplying collected information
  as a header field to SpamAssassin. Provide compatibility with Net::Server
  0.91 and later.

- fix insufficient sender address sanitation when storing quarantined or
  forwarded files as BSMTP files _and_ having a %s in the corresponding
  *_method template; potential security vulnerability (with limited scope)
  in versions of amavisd-new 2.3.1, 2.3.2 and 2.3.3 discovered by Thomas
  Jarosch;

- recognize result "ms-windows metafile" (or "ms-windows metafont") from a
  file(1) utility and provide short type 'wmf' for it; added two example
  rules to amavisd.conf (and amavisd.conf-sample) to block files containing
  Windows Metafiles, based on US-CERT Alert TA05-362A;

  - use $hdrfrom_notify_recip address in the From: field for recipient
    notifications, instead of $hdrfrom_notify_admin; inconsistency pointed out
    by Ekkehard Burkon;
  - the 'neutral' sender notification template was joining the Subject and the
    Message-ID header fields into one longer Subject when it was reporting some
    nondelivery other than the 'invalid characters in header'.  Likewise the
    first body line of this same DSN was eaten up: "This nondelivery report was
    generated by the amavisd-new program" (the problem was introduced in
