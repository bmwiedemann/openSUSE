  <title>Configures authentication and identity sources from supported profiles</title>
  <description>Authselect is designed to be a replacement for authconfig but it takes
a different approach to configure the system. Instead of letting
the administrator build the PAM stack with a tool (which may potentially
end up with a broken configuration), it would ship several tested stacks
(profiles) that solve a use-case and are well tested and supported.
At the same time, some obsolete features of authconfig are not
supported by authselect.</description>
