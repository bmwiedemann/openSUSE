Sat Dec 23 12:42:24 UTC 2023 - Christoph G <foss@grueninger.de>

- update to version 2.72
  * Support for ensuring time_t is Y2038-safe
    configure can now ensure that time_t can represent moments in time
    after 18 January 2038, i.e. 2**31 - 1 seconds after the Unix epoch.
    On most 64-bit systems this is true by default; the new feature
    is detection of systems where time_t is a 32-bit signed integer by
    default, *and* there is an alternative mode in which it is larger,
    in which case that mode will be enabled.
  * AC_USE_SYSTEM_EXTENSIONS now enables C23 Annex F extensions
    by defining __STDC_WANT_IEC_60559_EXT__.
  * Configure scripts no longer support pre-1989 C compilers.
  * Autoconf developers now need Perl 5.10 (2007) or later.
  * Autoconf users now need GNU M4 1.4.8 (2006) or later.
  * Some m4sh diversions have been renumbered.
  * AC_FUNC_GETGROUPS and AC_TYPE_GETGROUPS no longer run test programs.
  * All internal uses of AC_EGREP_CPP and AC_EGREP_HEADER have been removed.
- Update dependencies as recommendd to m4 1.4.16, Perl 5.10

Sun Dec 13 18:52:47 UTC 2020 - Andreas Stieger <andreas.stieger@gmx.de>

- autoconf 2.70:
  * Warnings about obsolete constructs are now on by default,
    these warnings can be turned off with -Wno-obsolete
  * Many macros have become pickier about argument quotation
  * Many macros no longer AC_REQUIRE as many other macros as they
    used to, may expose several classes of latent bugs
  * More macros use config.sub and config.guess internally
  * Setting CC to a C++ compiler is no longer supported
  * Running configure tests with warnings promoted to errors is
    not supported
  * Including confdefs.h manually may cause test failures
  * Older versions of automake and aclocal (< 1.8) are no longer
    supported
  * AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS no longer directly supports Cygnus configure
  * AC_CHECK_HEADER and AC_CHECK_HEADERS only do a compilation test
  * AC_INCLUDES_DEFAULT assumes an ISO C90 compliant C implementation
  * AS_ECHO and AS_ECHO_N unconditionally use ‘printf’
  * Configure scripts require support for $( ... ) command
    substitution
  * AC_INIT now trims extra white space from its arguments
  * Macros that take whitespace-separated lists as arguments
    now always expand macros within those arguments

  * Configure scripts now support a ‘--runstatedir’ option
  * autoreconf will now run gtkdocize and intltoolize when appropriate
  * autoreconf now recognizes AM_GNU_GETTEXT_REQUIRE_VERSION

    input file now elicits a warning in the “obsolete” category
  * Use of the undocumented internal shell variables $as_echo and
    $as_echo_n now elicits a warning in the “obsolete” category.
    The macros AS_ECHO and AS_ECHO_N should be used instead.
  * autoconf will now issue warnings (in the “syntax” category)
    if the input file is missing a call to AC_INIT and/or AC_OUTPUT
  * autoconf will now issue warnings (in the “syntax” category)
    for a non-literal URL argument to AC_INIT, and for a TARNAME
    argument to AC_INIT which is either non-literal or contains
    characters that should not be used in file names (e.g. ‘*’).
  * AC_PROG_CC_STDC, AC_PROG_CC_C89, AC_PROG_CC_C99 are now
    obsolete. Applications should use AC_PROG_CC.
  * AC_HEADER_STDC and AC_HEADER_TIME are now stubs.

Thu Apr 26 14:43:27 CEST 2012 - pth@suse.de

- Update to 2.69:
  * Noteworthy changes in release 2.69 (2012-04-24) [stable]

  ** Autoconf now requires perl 5.6 or better (but generated
     configure scripts continue to run without perl).

  * Noteworthy changes in release 2.68b (2012-03-01) [beta] Released
    by Eric Blake, based on git versions 2.68.*.

  ** Autoconf-generated configure scripts now unconditionally
     re-execute themselves with $CONFIG_SHELL, if that's set in the
     environment.

  ** The texinfo documentation no longer specifies "front-cover" or
     "back-cover" texts, so that it may now be included in Debian's
     "main" section.

  ** Support for the Go programming language has been added.  The new
     macro AC_LANG_GO sets variables GOC and GOFLAGS.

  ** AS_LITERAL_IF again treats '=' as a literal.  Regression
     introduced in 2.66.

  ** The macro AS_EXECUTABLE_P, present since 2.50, is now
     documented.

  ** Macros

  - AC_PROG_LN_S and AS_LN_S now fall back on 'cp -pR' (not 'cp -p')
    if 'ln -s' does not work.  This works better for symlinks to
    directories.

  - New macro AC_HEADER_CHECK_STDBOOL.

  - New and updated macros for Fortran support:

      AC_FC_CHECK_BOUNDS to enable array bounds checking
      AC_F77_IMPLICIT_NONE and AC_FC_IMPLICIT_NONE to disable implicit integer
      AC_FC_MODULE_EXTENSION to compute the Fortran 90 module name extension
      AC_FC_MODULE_FLAG for the Fortran 90 module search path flag
      AC_FC_MODULE_OUTPUT_FLAG for the Fortran 90 module output directory flag
      AC_FC_PP_SRCEXT for preprocessed Fortran source files extensions
      AC_FC_PP_DEFINE for the Fortran preprocessor define flag

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Dec 10 11:24:33 UTC 2010 - coolo@novell.com

- update to 2.68 to include the patch
** AC_MSG_ERROR (and AS_ERROR) can once again be followed immediately by
   `dnl'.  Regression introduced in 2.66.

** AC_INIT again allows URLs with '?' for its BUG-REPORT argument.
   Regression introduced in 2.66.

** AC_REPLACE_FUNCS again allows a non-literal argument, such as a shell
   variable that expands to a list of functions to check.  Regression
   introduced in 2.66.

** AT_BANNER() with empty argument will cause visual separation from previous
   test category.

** The macros AC_PREPROC_IFELSE, AC_COMPILE_IFELSE, AC_LINK_IFELSE, and
   AC_RUN_IFELSE now warn if the first argument failed to use
   AC_LANG_SOURCE or AC_LANG_PROGRAM to generate the conftest file
   contents.  A new macro AC_LANG_DEFINES_PROVIDED exists if you have
   a compelling reason why you cannot use AC_LANG_SOURCE but must
   avoid the warning.

** Newly obsolete macros
   The following macros have been marked obsolete.  New programs
   should use the corresponding Gnulib modules.  Gnulib not only
   detects a larger set of portability problems with these functions,
   but also provides complete workarounds.

     AC_FUNC_ERROR_AT_LINE  AC_FUNC_LSTAT_FOLLOWS_SLASHED_SYMLINK
     AC_FUNC_MKTIME  AC_FUNC_STRTOD

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Sep 19 07:45:20 UTC 2010 - andrea@opensuse.org

- added patch autoconf-2.67-fix_dnl.patch to fix regression in
  AC_MSG_ERROR expansion (undefined macro: AS_MESSAGE_LOG_FDdnl)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug 18 12:04:55 CEST 2010 - pth@suse.de

- Update to 2.67:

  * New macro AC_FC_LINE_LENGTH to accept long Fortran source code
    lines.

  * AC_PREPROC_IFELSE now keeps the preprocessed output in the
    conftest.i file for inspection by the commands in the
    ACTION-IF-TRUE argument.

  * autoreconf passes warning flags to new enough versions of
    aclocal.

  * Running an Autotest testsuite in parallel mode no longer triggers
    a race condition that could cause the testsuite run to end early,
    fixing a sporadic failure in autoconf's own testsuite.  Bug
    present since introduction of parallel tests in 2.63b.

  Major changes in Autoconf 2.66 (2010-07-02) [stable]

  * AC_FUNC_MMAP works in C++ mode again.  Regression introduced in
    2.65.

  * Use of m4_divert without a named diversion now issues a syntax
    warning, since it is seldom right to change diversions behind
    autoconf's back.

  * The macros AC_TYPE_INT8_T, AC_TYPE_INT16_T, AC_TYPE_INT32_T, and
    AC_TYPE_INT64_T work again.  Regression introduced in 2.65.

  * AC_PROG_INSTALL correctly uses `shtool' again.  Regression
    introduced in 2.64.

  * Autoconf should work on EBCDIC hosts.

  * AC_CHECK_DECL and AC_CHECK_DECLS accept optional function
    argument types for overloaded C++ functions.

  * AS_SET_CATFILE accepts nonliterals in its variable name argument
    now.

  * Autotest testsuites accept an option --recheck to rerun tests
    that failed or passed unexpectedly during the last non-debug
    testsuite run.

  * AC_ARG_ENABLE and AC_ARG_WITH now also accept `+' signs in
     `--enable-*' and `--with-*' arguments, converting them to
     underscores for the variable names.

  * In configure scripts, loading CONFIG_SITE no longer searches
     PATH, and problems in loading the configuration site files are
     diagnosed.

  * Autotest testsuites may optionally provide colored test results.

  * The previously undocumented Autotest macros AT_ARG_OPTION and
    AT_ARG_OPTION_ARG have seen bug fixes and are documented now. 
    AT_ARG_OPTION has been changed in that the negative of a long
    option --OPTION is now --no-OPTION rather than --noOPTION.

  * The macro AS_LITERAL_IF is slightly more conservative; text
    containing shell quotes are no longer treated as literals. 
    Furthermore, a new macro, AS_LITERAL_WORD_IF, adds an additional
    level of checking that no whitespace occurs in literals.

  * The macros AS_TR_SH and AS_TR_CPP no longer expand their results.

  * The following macros are now documented:
    AS_BOX

  * New macro AC_FC_FIXEDFORM to accept fixed-form Fortran.

- Update to 2.65
  ** Autoconf is now licensed under the GPLv3+.
  ** The manual is now shipped under the terms of the GNU FDL 1.3.
  ** config.status now provides a --config option to produce the configuration.
  ** Autoconf now requires GNU M4 1.4.6 or later. GNU M4 1.4.13 or
     later is recommended.
  ** Autotest testsuites accept an option --jobs[=N] for parallel testing.
     This feature is still in testing, and may not work on every
     platform, help in improving it would be appreciated.

    incompatibility between autoconf 2.63 and automake 1.11
    ! This patch needs to be removed with autoconf 2.64 again ! 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 10 09:59:08 CEST 2008 - schwab@suse.de

- Update to autoconf 2.63.
  ** AC_C_BIGENDIAN does not mistakenly report "universal" for some
     bigendian hosts, a regression introduced with universal binary
     support in 2.62.
  ** AC_PATH_X now includes /lib64 and /usr/lib64 in its list of default
     library directories.
  ** AC_USE_SYSTEM_EXTENSIONS no longer conflicts with an external
     AC_DEFINE([__EXTENSIONS__]).  This fixes a regression introduced in
     2.62 when using macros such as AC_AIX that were made obsolete in
     favor of the more portable AC_USE_SYSTEM_EXTENSIONS.
  ** AC_CHECK_TARGET_TOOLS is usable in the non-cross-compile case.
  ** Newly obsolete macros
     The following macro has been marked obsolete, since current porting
     targets can safely assume C89 semantics that signal handlers return
     void.  We have no current plans to remove the macro.
       AC_TYPE_SIGNAL
  ** The macros m4_map and m4_map_sep now ignore any list elements
     consisting of just empty quotes, and m4_map_sep now expands its
     separator.  This fixes a regression in 2.62 when these macros were
     first documented, for the sake of clients expecting the semantics
     that these macros had prior to that time.  The new macros m4_mapall
     and m4_mapall_sep, along with extra quoting of the separator, can
     be used to get the semantics that m4_map_sep had in 2.62.
  ** Clients of m4_expand, such as AS_HELP_STRING and AT_SETUP, can now
     handle properly quoted but otherwise unbalanced parentheses (for
     some macros, this fixes a regression in 2.62).
  ** Two new quadrigraphs have been introduced: @{:@ for (, and @:}@ for ),
     allowing the output of unbalanced parentheses in more contexts.
  ** The following m4sugar macros are new:
     m4_joinall  m4_mapall  m4_mapall_sep  m4_reverse  m4_set_add
     m4_set_add_all  m4_set_contains  m4_set_contents  m4_set_delete
     m4_set_difference  m4_set_dump  m4_set_empty  m4_set_foreach
     m4_set_intersection  m4_set_list  m4_set_listc  m4_set_remove
     m4_set_size  m4_set_union
  ** The following m4sugar macros now accept multiple arguments, as is the
     case with underlying m4:
     m4_defn  m4_popdef  m4_undefine
  ** The following m4sugar macros now guarantee linear scaling; they
     previously had linear scaling with m4 1.6 but quadratic scaling
     when using m4 1.4.x.  All macros built on top of these also gain
     the scaling improvements.
     m4_bmatch  m4_bpatsubsts  m4_case  m4_cond  m4_do  m4_dquote_elt
     m4_foreach  m4_join  m4_list_cmp  m4_map  m4_map_sep  m4_max
     m4_min  m4_shiftn
  ** AT_KEYWORDS once again performs expansion on its argument, such that
     AT_KEYWORDS([m4_if([$1], [], [default])]) no longer complains about
     the possibly unexpanded m4_if [regression introduced in 2.62].
  ** Config header templates `#undef UNDEFINED /* comment */' do not lead to
     nested comments any more; regression introduced in 2.62.
