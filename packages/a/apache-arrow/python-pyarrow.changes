- Update to 13.0.0
  ## Compatibility notes:
  * The default format version for Parquet has been bumped from 2.4
    to 2.6 GH-35746. In practice, this means that nanosecond
    timestamps now preserve its resolution instead of being
    converted to microseconds.
  * Support for Python 3.7 is dropped GH-34788
  ## New features:
  * Conversion to non-nano datetime64 for pandas >= 2.0 is now
    supported GH-33321
  * Write page index is now supported GH-36284
  * Bindings for reading JSON format in Dataset are added GH-34216
  * keys_sorted property of MapType is now exposed GH-35112
  ## Other improvements:
  * Common python functionality between Table and RecordBatch
    classes has been consolidated ( GH-36129, GH-35415, GH-35390,
    GH-34979, GH-34868, GH-31868)
  * Some functionality for FixedShapeTensorType has been improved
    (__reduce__ GH-36038, picklability GH-35599)
  * Pyarrow scalars can now be accepted in the array constructor
    GH-21761
  * DataFrame Interchange Protocol implementation and usage is now
    documented GH-33980
  * Conversion between Arrow and Pandas for map/pydict now has
    enhanced support GH-34729
  * Usability of pc.map_lookup / MapLookupOptions is improved
    GH-36045

    ChunkedArray.to_numpy() GH-34787
  * Python C++ codebase now has linter support in Archery and the
    CI GH-35485
  ## Relevant bug fixes:
  * __array__ numpy conversion for Table and RecordBatch is now
    corrected so that np.asarray(pa.Table) doesn’t return a
    transposed result GH-34886
  * parquet.write_to_dataset doesn’t create empty files for
    non-observed dictionary (category) values anymore GH-23870
  * Dataset writer now also correctly follows default Parquet
    version of 2.6 GH-36537
  * Comparing pyarrow.dataset.Partitioning with other type is now
    correctly handled GH-36659
  * Pickling of pyarrow.dataset PartitioningFactory objects is now
    supported GH-34884
  * None schema is now disallowed in parquet writer GH-35858
  * pa.FixedShapeTensorArray.to_numpy_ndarray is not failing on
    sliced arrays GH-35573
  * Halffloat type is now supported in the conversion from Arrow
    list to pandas GH-36168
  * __from_arrow__ is now also implemented for Array.to_pandas for
    pandas extension data types GH-36096

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 18 07:28:28 UTC 2023 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 12.0.0
  ## Compatibility notes:
  * Plasma has been removed in this release (GH-33243). In
    addition, the deprecated serialization module in PyArrow was
    also removed (GH-29705). IPC (Inter-Process Communication)
    functionality of pyarrow or the standard library pickle should
    be used instead.
  * The deprecated use_async keyword has been removed from the
    dataset module (GH-30774)
  * Minimum Cython version to build PyArrow from source has been
    raised to 0.29.31 (GH-34933). In addition, PyArrow can now be
    compiled using Cython 3 (GH-34564).
  ## New features:
  * A new pyarrow.acero module with initial bindings for the Acero
    execution engine has been added (GH-33976)
  * A new canonical extension type for fixed shaped tensor data has
    been defined. This is exposed in PyArrow as the
    FixedShapeTensorType (GH-34882, GH-34956)
  * Run-End Encoded arrays binding has been implemented (GH-34686,
    GH-34568)
  * Method is_nan has been added to Array, ChunkedArray and
    Expression (GH-34154)
  * Dataframe interchange protocol has been implemented for
    RecordBatch (GH-33926)
  ## Other improvements:
  * Extension arrays can now be concatenated (GH-31868)
  * get_partition_keys helper function is implemented in the
    dataset module to access the partitioning field’s key/value
    from the partition expression of a certain dataset fragment
    (GH-33825)
  * PyArrow Array objects can now be accepted by the pa.array()
    constructor (GH-34411)
  * The default row group size when writing parquet files has been
    changed (GH-34280)
  * RecordBatch has the select() method implemented (GH-34359)
  * New method drop_column on the pyarrow.Table supports passing a
    single column as a string (GH-33377)
  * User-defined tabular functions, which are a user-functions
    implemented in Python that return a stateful stream of tabular
    data, are now also supported (GH-32916)
  * Arrow Archery tool now includes linting of the Cython files
    (GH-31905)
  * Breaking Change: Reorder output fields of “group_by” node so
    that keys/segment keys come before aggregates (GH-33616)
  ## Relevant bug fixes:
  * Acero can now detect and raise an error in case a join
    operation needs too much bytes of key data (GH-34474)
  * Fix for converting non-sequence object in pa.array() (GH-34944)
  * Fix erroneous table conversion to pandas if table includes an
    extension array that does not implement to_pandas_dtype
    (GH-34906)
  * Reading from a closed ArrayStreamBatchReader now returns
    invalid status instead of segfaulting (GH-34165)
  * array() now returns pyarrow.Array and not pyarrow.ChunkedArray
    for columns with __arrow_array__ method and only one chunk so
    that the conversion of pandas dataframe with categorical column
    of dtype string[pyarrow] does not fail (GH-33727)
  * Custom type mapper in to_pandas now converts index dtypes
    together with column dtypes (GH-34283)
