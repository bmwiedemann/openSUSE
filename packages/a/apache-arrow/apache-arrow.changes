- Update to 13.0.0
  ## Acero
  * Handling of unaligned buffers is input nodes can be configured
    programmatically or by setting the environment variable
    ACERO_ALIGNMENT_HANDLING. The default behavior is to warn when
    an unaligned buffer is detected GH-35498.
  ## Compute
  * Several new functions have been added:
    - aggregate functions “first”, “last”, “first_last” GH-34911;
    - vector functions “cumulative_prod”, “cumulative_min”,
      “cumulative_max” GH-32190;
    - vector function “pairwise_diff” GH-35786.
  * Sorting now works on dictionary arrays, with a much better
    performance than the naive approach of sorting the decoded
    dictionary GH-29887. Sorting also works on struct arrays, and
    nested sort keys are supported using FieldRed GH-33206.
  * The check_overflow option has been removed from
    CumulativeSumOptions as it was redundant with the availability
    of two different functions: “cumulative_sum” and
    “cumulative_sum_checked” GH-35789.
  * Run-end encoded filters are efficiently supported GH-35749.
  * Duration types are supported with the “is_in” and “index_in”
    functions GH-36047. They can be multiplied with all integer
    types GH-36128.
  * “is_in” and “index_in” now cast their inputs more flexibly:
    they first attempt to cast the value set to the input type,
    then in the other direction if the former fails GH-36203.
  * Multiple bugs have been fixed in “utf8_slice_codeunits” when
    the stop option is omitted GH-36311.
  ## Dataset
  * A custom schema can now be passed when writing a dataset
    GH-35730. The custom schema can alter nullability or metadata
    information, but is not allowed to change the datatypes
    written.
  ## Filesystems
  * The S3 filesystem now writes files in equal-sized chunks, for
    compatibility with Cloudflare’s “R2” Storage GH-34363.
  * A long-standing issue where S3 support could crash at shutdown
    because of resources still being alive after S3 finalization
    has been fixed GH-36346. Now, attempts to use S3 resources
    (such as making filesystem calls) after S3 finalization should
    result in a clean error.
  * The GCS filesystem accepts a new option to set the project id
    GH-36227.
  ## IPC
  * Nullability and metadata information for sub-fields of map
    types is now preserved when deserializing Arrow IPC GH-35297.
  ## Orc
  * The Orc adapter now maps Arrow field metadata to Orc type
    attributes when writing, and vice-versa when reading GH-35304.
  ## Parquet
  * It is now possible to write additional metadata while a
    ParquetFileWriter is open GH-34888.
  * Writing a page index can be enabled selectively per-column
    GH-34949. In addition, page header statistics are not written
    anymore if the page index is enabled for the given column
    GH-34375, as the information would be redundant and less
    efficiently accessed.
  * Parquet writer properties allow specifying the sorting columns
    GH-35331. The user is responsible for ensuring that the data
    written to the file actually complies with the given sorting.
  * CRC computation has been implemented for v2 data pages
    GH-35171. It was already implemented for v1 data pages.
  * Writing compliant nested types is now enabled by default
    GH-29781. This should not have any negative implication.
  * Attempting to load a subset of an Arrow extension type is now
    forbidden GH-20385. Previously, if an extension type’s storage
    is nested (for example a “Point” extension type backed by a
    struct<x: float64, y: float64>), it was possible to load
    selectively some of the columns of the storage type.
  ## Substrait
  * Support for various functions has been added: “stddev”,
    “variance”, “first”, “last” (GH-35247, GH-35506).
  * Deserializing sorts is now supported GH-32763. However, some
    features, such as clustered sort direction or custom sort
    functions, are not implemented.
  ## Miscellaneous
  * FieldRef sports additional methods to get a flattened version
    of nested fields GH-14946. Compared to their non-flattened
    counterparts, the methods GetFlattened, GetAllFlattened,
    GetOneFlattened and GetOneOrNoneFlattened combine a child’s
    null bitmap with its ancestors’ null bitmaps such as to compute
    the field’s overall logical validity bitmap.
  * In other words, given the struct array [null, {'x': null},
    {'x': 5}], FieldRef("x")::Get might return [0, null, 5] while
    FieldRef("y")::GetFlattened will always return [null, null, 5].
  * Scalar::hash() has been fixed for sliced nested arrays
    GH-35360.
  * A new floating-point to decimal conversion algorithm exhibits
    much better precision GH-35576.
  * It is now possible to cast between scalars of different
    list-like types GH-36309.

  * Fixed ORC CHAR type mapping with Arrow (GH-34823)
  * Fixed timestamp type mapping between ORC and arrow (GH-34590)

Mon Apr  3 11:09:06 UTC 2023 - Andreas Schwab <schwab@suse.de>

- cflags.patch: fix option order to compile with optimisation
- Adjust constraints

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 29 13:13:13 UTC 2023 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Remove gflags-static. It was only needed due to a packaging error
  with gflags which is about to be fixed in Tumbleweed
- Disable build of the jemalloc memory pool backend
  * It requires every consuming application to LD_PRELOAD
    libjemalloc.so.2, even when it is not set as the default memory
    pool, due to static TLS block allocation errors
  * Usage of the bundled jemalloc as a workaround is not desired
    (gh#apache/arrow#13739)
  * jemalloc does not seem to have a clear advantage over the
    system glibc allocator:
    https://ursalabs.org/blog/2021-r-benchmarks-part-1
  * This overrides the default behavior documented in
    https://arrow.apache.org/docs/cpp/memory.html#default-memory-pool
