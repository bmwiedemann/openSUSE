  <title>Advanced TFTP Server and Client</title>
  <description>atftp stands for Advanced Trivial File Transfer Protocol. It is called
&quot;advanced&quot;, in contrast to others TFTP servers, for two reasons. First,
it is intended to be fully compliant with all related RFCs. This
includes RFC1350, RFC2090, RFC2347, RFC2348, and RFC2349. Second, atftp
is intended for serving boot files to large clusters. It is
multithreaded and will eventually support multicast, allowing faster
boot of hundreds of machines simultaneously.</description>
