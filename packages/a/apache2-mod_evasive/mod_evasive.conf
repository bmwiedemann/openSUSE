	# The hash table size defines the number of top-level nodes for each
	# child's hash table. Increasing this number will provide faster
	# performance by decreasing the number of iterations required to get to
	# the record, but consume more memory for table space. You should
	# increase this if you have a busy web server. The value you specify
	# will automatically be tiered up to the next prime number in the
	# primes list (see mod_evasive.c for a list of primes used).

	# This is the threshhold for the number of requests for the same page
	# (or URI) per page interval. Once the threshhold for that interval has
	# been exceeded, the IP address of the client will be added to the
	# blocking list.

	# This is the threshhold for the total number of requests for any
	# object by the same client on the same listener per site interval.
	# Once the threshhold for that interval has been exceeded, the IP
	# address of the client will be added to the blocking list.

	# The blocking period is the amount of time (in seconds) that a client
	# will be blocked for if they are added to the blocking list. During
	# this time, all subsequent requests from the client will result in a
	# 403 (Forbidden) and the timer being reset (e.g. another 10 seconds).
	# Since the timer is reset for every subsequent request, it is not
	# necessary to have a long blocking period; in the event of a DoS
	# attack, this timer will keep getting reset.

	DOSBlockingPeriod   10

	# If this value is set, an email will be sent to the address specified

	# If this value is set, the system command specified will be executed
