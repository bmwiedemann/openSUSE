  * the uploaded data size calculation bug was fixed

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct 23 23:04:40 UTC 2012 - reddwarf@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.15.2:
  Fixes several critical bugs. It also adds new features such as
  TLS SNI and CORS support. The --file--allocation option now take
  another value trunc. The new option --enalbe-mmap was added.
  aria2 now uses system-wide SSL/TLS certificates by default, which
  eliminates the requirement to specify --ca-certificate option.
- Remove aria2-1.15.1-system_certificates.patch. Applied upstream.
- Remove autotools BuildRequires since we don't have patches any more.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- license update: SUSE-GPL-2.0-with-openssl-exception
  SPDX format for this license - which has an openssl exception

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun 29 12:24:33 UTC 2012 - reddwarf@opensuse.org

- Remove aria2-atoi.patch, aria2-cares-lib64.patch and
  aria2-cares-static.patch
- Run spec-cleaner
- Use xml2 instead of expat as prefered by upstream
- Add GnuTLS support
- Merge bash-completion support into the main package
- Change license tag to GPL-2.0+ since it doesn't use OpenSSL
- Use pkgconfig() style BuildRequires
- Add aria2-1.15.1-system_certificates.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun 29 10:19:20 UTC 2012 - reddwarf@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.15.1:
  + Return appropriate HTTP status code on RPC failure.  In this
    change, we return 404 if the request path is neither /json-rpc
    nor /rpc. If XML feature is not enabled and /rpc is requested,
    return 404.  If XML parser failed, return 400. JSON parser
    failure has been handled well in the existing code.
  + Ignore unacceptable options in RPC request instead of throwing
    error. This change allows RPC client to send same options for
    the different type of downloads.
  + Handle sockaddr_in.sin_len and sockaddr_in6.sin6_len.  Check
    sockaddr_in.sin_len and sockaddr_in6.sin6_len are available and
    assign values to them properly.  This change fixes unit test
    error and most error related to getnameinfo() on netbsd.
  + Removed dependency on inet_aton.  Implemented inetPton as a
    replacement of inet_aton. inetPton is implemented using
    net::getBinAddr.  This change fixes bug#3525424.
  + Added --with-bashcompletiondir configure option.  By default,
    bash_completion file named aria2c is installed to the directory
    $prefix/share/doc/aria2/bash_completion.  To change the install
    directory of the file, use --with-bashcompletiondir option.
  + Converted README.asciidoc into README.rst
  + Use Sphinx for aria2 manual page documentation.  The source
    files for manual pages are placed under doc/manual-src.  The
    manual pages are generated under doc/manual-src/$LANG/_build.
    The HTML version manual page was dropped from the distribution
    archive.
  + Fixed the bug which prevents --bt-lpd-interface from working.
    Fixes bug#3520125
- Remove support for old distributions

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr  9 12:15:39 UTC 2012 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.15.0:
  + Use CreateProcessW instead of CreateProcessA in MinGW build.
    This means filename is now passed as wchar string, not UTF-8
    encoded char string.
  + Check with pkg-config only: c-ares, openssl, sqlite3 and zlib.
  + Fixed compile error with i686-w64-mingw32 and
    x86_64-w64-mingw32 cross compilers.
  + Get the home directory of the effective user ID using
    getpwuid() if $HOME is not defined.
  + Don't use locale dependent toupper and tolower.
  + Rewritten TLS hostname check based on RFC 6125 for both GNUTLS
    and OpenSSL builds.
  + Added --bt-remove-unselected-file option.  Removes the
    unselected files when download is completed in BitTorrent. To
    select files, use --select-file option. If it is not used, all
    files are assumed to be selected. Please use this option with
    care because it will actually remove files from your disk.
    This option is default to false.
  + Fixed compile error on Open Solaris. Fixes bug#3497518
  + Added JSON-RPC over WebSocket.
  + Fixed assertion failure if Chunked encoding along with
    Content-Length is used.
  + Fixed clang and gcc-4.7 warning and errors.
  + Fixed the bug that aria2 cannot read line longer than 4096
    bytes from the file specified by --input-file option
    (sf#3495336).
- Drop aria2-1.14.2-gcc47.patch: fixed upstream.

Wed Feb 29 18:56:56 UTC 2012 - pascal.bleser@opensuse.org

- update to 1.14.2:
  * only accepts 32 bit integer values from int and i4 elements in XML-RPC;
    fixed overflow bug in aria2.tellWaiting and aria2.tellStopped RPC methods
  * updated Spanish, Italian, Russian and Chinese (Simplified) translations
  * fixed the bug that aria2 does not listen on address given in --interface
  * check scheme part in redirected URI more strictly: the previous
    implementation mistakenly sees '/abspath?uri=http://foo' as an absolute URI
    because it contains '://', but actually it is not; this change checks
    scheme part is constructed in the allowed character set described in RFC
    3986 Section 3.1
  * allow missing params in XML-RPC request
  * fixed "Max payload length exceeded or invalid" error when the number of
    pieces is very large
  * added --deferred-input option; if true is given to --deferred-input option,
    aria2 does not read all URIs and options from file specified by -i option
    at startup, but it reads one by one when it needs later; this may reduce
    memory usage if input file contains a lot of URIs to download; if false is
    given, aria2 reads all URIs and options at startup;tThis option defaults to
    false

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Feb 18 11:04:36 UTC 2012 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.14.1:
  + This version fixes the bug that prevents the --checksum option
    from working correctly.
  + It also fixes the bug where a log file was not created if a
    warn level log was created before the log file was opened.
  + Now aria2 doesn't assume the download has completed just 
    because file size matched. The old behavior is problematic,
    because aria2 just assumes the download is completed, but in
    reality it is not. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 12 11:30:29 UTC 2012 - coolo@suse.com

- change license to be in spdx.org format

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec 26 11:06:49 UTC 2011 - pascal.bleser@opensuse.org

- update to 1.14.0:
 * updated Chinese (Simplified), Spanish, French and Russian translations
 * ignore peer which possibly sent bad data in next few minutes. In aria2, one
   piece is downloaded from several peers, so when hash check failed for that
   piece, it cannot determine which peer(s) sent bad data. So, we ignore peer
   who sent last block of data in random minutes. We use randomized timeout
   because all peers get waken up at the almost same time.
 * Added suggestion for unknown/ambiguous options. The help messages shown when
   argument error were redesigned and less verbose now. When unknown or
   ambiguous option is given, show suggestions like "Did you mean...". Some
   constant values related to levenstein distance are borrowed from git help.c.
 * Added --stop-with-process=PID option. This feature stops application when
   process PID is not running. This is useful if aria2 process is forked from a
   parent process. The parent process can fork aria2 with its own pid and when
   parent process exits for some reason, aria2 can detect it and shutdown
   itself.
 * Support IPv6 address for FTP via HTTP tunneling.
 * The previous implementation could not handle the situation when user,
   password and proxy URI is given various order. Now we just set rules:
   username set in --*-proxy-user overrides username in --*-proxy option, no
   matter in any order username, password and proxy URI are parsed. Likewise,
   password set in --*--proxy-passwd overrides password in --*-proxy option.
 * Changed format of ETA. Now no leading 0 is used. If hour part and/or min
   part is non-zero, and sec part is 0, sec part is omitted, like this "1h3m".
 * Rewritten Metalink XML parser. Now we don't strip white spaces while parsing
   Metalink V3 document.
 * Now xml attribute and characters in RPC request is not stripped at all.
 * Fixed bug that some information such as port number is lost if redirect URI
   contains only path component.
 * Apply PREF_MAX_CONNECTION_PER_SERVER to BitTorrent WEB Seeding hosts.
 * Reuse in-flight and pooled URIs when a download is paused.
 * Deprecated --metalink-server option. Use --split option instead.
 * Made max value of --select-file to 65535
 * Use same domain-match algorithm for no-proxy and netrc. Now "example.org"
   does not domain-match ".example.org" in both functions.
 * For waiting or paused downloads, the options listed in Input File subsection
   in man page are available in aria2.changeOption RPC method, except for
   following options: dry-run, metalink-base-uri, parameterized-uri, pause and
   piece_length.
 * Made --download-result, --save-session, --server-stat-of and --save-cookies
   option available in aria2.changeGlobalOption. In addition to them, the
   options listed in Input File subsection in man page are also available,
   except for following options: checksum, index-out, out, pause and
   select-file.
 * Made --uri-selector option available in -i list.
 * Support IPv6 literal address in proxy option.
 * Support IPv6 CIDR block in --http-no-proxy option.
 * HttpProxyOptionHandler: Enclose hostname with square brackets if hostname is
   IPv6 numeric address.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct 14 22:08:37 UTC 2011 - pascal.bleser@opensuse.org

- update to 1.13.0:
  * fixes libgcrypt version check error
  * now returns error response if RPC request parameter has wrong type
  * on >= 12.1, aria2 uses libnettle and libgmp instead of libgcrypt
  * added --piece-length option: sets a piece length for HTTP/FTP downloads; is
    the boundary when aria2 splits a file; all splits occur at multiple of this
    length; will be ignored in BitTorrent downloads and if Metalink file
    contains piece hashes
 * cleanup log message for binding server socket
 * recognize tab as white space before option in -i list
 * added geom parameter to --stream-piece-selector option: if 'geom' is given,
   at the beginning aria2 selects piece which has minimum index like 'inorder',
   but it exponentially increasingly keeps space from previously selected
   piece; will reduce the number of establishing connection and at the same
   time it will download the beginning part of the file first; useful to view
   movie while downloading it
 * added completedLength response key in aria2.getFiles RPC method
 * added #checksum help tag.
 * added --checksum and --checksum=TYPE=DIGEST option: sets checksum; TYPE is
   hash type; supported hash type is listed in "Hash Algorithms" in "aria2c
   -v"; DIGEST is hex digest; applies only to HTTP(S)/FTP downloads
 * added --hash-check-only opiton: if true is given, after hash check using
   --check-integrity option, abort download whether or not download is
   complete; default is false
 * added --download-result option: changes the way "Download Results" is formatted
 * added --rpc-allow-origin-all option: adds Access-Control-Allow-Origin header
   field with value '*' to the RPC response
 * ignore --out option supplied in command-line if -i is used; can still use
   out option in the text file specified in -i
 * disable SSLv2 by default and optimize memory usage
 * added libnettle and libgmp support

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Sep 17 12:13:00 UTC 2011 - jengelh@medozas.de

- Remove redundant tags/sections from specfile

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug 03 23:27:09 UTC 2011 - pascal.bleser@opensuse.org

- update to 1.12.1:
  * adds RFC 6249 Metalink/HTTP support
  * current implementation only uses rel=duplicate links
  * --enable-direct-io option was deprecated because of performance issue
  * since recent GnuTLS uses libnettle as default instead of libgcrypt, this
    release added initialization code for libgcrypt
  * Initialize libgcrypt.  We relied initialization of libgcrypt on
    gnutls_global_init(), but recent change in gnutls, which changes default
    crypto backend from libgcrypt to libnettle, leaves libgcrypt uninitialized
    if it uses libnettle as backend (and this is likely because libnettle is
    chosen by default). To fix this issue, we simply initialize libgcrypt on our
    own.
  * Throw exception with error message if gnutls_global_init() failed.
  * Implemented Metalink/HTTP. Link header fields from first Metalink server is
    utilized as described in rfc6249. We only set digest from Digest header
    field to DownloadContext only when PieceStorage is not initialized(in other
    words, before file size is known). After PieceStorage is initialized, Digest
    header field is used to check the value is the same in digest in
    DownloadContext. Current implementation only handles rel=duplicate.
  * Remove Metalink content-type after first server response.
  * Updated Russian translation of aria2 man page.
  * Fixed the bug due to dangling pointers in RequestGroup.
  * Added log message to clarify error for BitTorrent server socket.
  * Added #deprecated help tag.
  * Removed deprecated options: --enable-xml-rpc, --xml-rpc-listen-all,
    --xml-rpc-listen-port, --xml-rpc-max-request-size, --xml-rpc-user,
    --xml-rpc-passwd.
  * Removed use of O_DIRECT because of performance issue.  Deprecated
    --enable-direct-io option.
  * Increased the maximum number of in-flight request in BitTorrent.
  * Added --log option to aria2rpc

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun 30 21:52:54 UTC 2011 - pascal.bleser@opensuse.org

- update to 1.12.0:
  * Use ServerStat to find faster server. This is useful when several downloads
    were started in parallel, but one download is slow and the other downloads
    have completed. Then aria2 knows which servers are fast by the results of
    completed downloads, and check the available URIs of slow downloads to see
    faster server is available there. If so, use it instead of current slow one
    to make download faster.
  * Added Russian translation of man page and HTML manual.
  * Added aria2.getGlobalStat RPC method. It returns overall download/upload
    speed and the number of active/stopped/waiting downloads.
  * Added --pause option.  This option pauses download after added. This option
    is effective only when --enable-rpc=true is given. When --save-session
    option is used and there are paused downloads, they are saved with
    --pause=true so that it will become paused state when the session is
    recovered.
  * Abort aria2 if it could not setup any RPC server.
  * Added --truncate-console-readout option.  This option truncates console
    readout to fit in a single line. This is default. Give false value to this
    option to tell aria2 not to truncate console readout.
  * Cache and reuse RpcMethod objects.
  * Allowed missing params in system.multicall RPC method.
  * Added --stream-piece-selector option. This option specifies piece selection
    algorithm used in HTTP/FTP download. Piece means fixed length segment which
    is downloaded in parallel in segmented download. If 'default' is given,
    aria2 selects piece so that it reduces the number of establishing
    connection. This is reasonable default behaviour because establishing
    connection is an expensive operation.  If 'inorder' is given, aria2 selects
    piece which has minimum index. Index=0 means first of the file. This will
    be useful to view movie while downloading it. --enable-http-pipelining
    option may be useful to reduce reconnection overhead.  Please note that
    aria2 honors --min-split-size option, so it will be necessary to specify a
    reasonable value to --min-split-size option.
  * Removed unnecessary template parameter from std::make_pair call.
  * Only percent-encode non-printable ASCII chars(0x00-0x1f), non-ASCII
    chars(>0x7f), ' ', '"', '<' and '>' for URIs supplied by user and remote
    server(usually Location header field).
  * Don't throw exception if Z_BUF_ERROR is encountered in GZipEncoder. This
    fixed the bug that compressed RPC request failed.
  * Don't save removed download in --save-session text file. Now stat column of
    removed downloads in Download Results is 'RM' instead of INPR.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun May 22 10:51:15 UTC 2011 - pascal.bleser@opensuse.org

- update to 1.11.2:
 * Updated Japanese, Spanish and Simplified Chinese translation
 * Eliminated few seconds delay when downloads stop or pause
 * Added --metalink-base-uri option.  --metalink-uri option specifies
   base URI to resolve relative URI in metalink file stored in local
   disk. If URI points to a directory, URI must end with '/'.
 * Fixed the bug that the message "Loaded cookies from ..." appears
   when loading cookies from that file failed.
 * Support relative URI in Metalink file.  If relative URI is found in
   Metalink file, aria2 resolves its full URI contatenating the URI
   from which Metalink file is retrieved and relative URI in Metalink
   file. This feature is not available if Metalink file in local disk
   is specified in command line.
 * Erase user and password specified in command-line from argv.  The
   user and password is masked with '*'.
 * If no data type tag is used in XML-RPC, treat the data as string.

- changes from 1.11.1:
 * Added --show-console-readout option. This option toggles
   appearance of console readout.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- update to 1.10.9:
  * fixes the bug in which aria2 wrongly determines a peer as a seeder and
    drops connection in the seed state
  * some improvements and bug fixes in the BitTorrent implementation were made:
    + bump up DHT version number to 3
    + don't try legacy BitTorrent handshake when first connection attempt timed out
    + don't send announce_peer message with empty token in DHTPeerLookupTask;
      replace old node ID with new node ID when response message is received in
      DHTAbstractNodeLookupTask
    + drop old node from DHT routing table if node ID has changed
    + drop connection if client and peer are both seeders
    + fixed the bug that peer is marked as seeder whenever it sends extension
      handshake with metadata size

    systems
  * fixes the bug that prevented the dht.dat file from being saved
  * improper use of the return value of vsnprintf was fixed, which caused
    segmentation fault when formatting strings more than 1024 characters long

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct 22 07:30:22 UTC 2010 - pascal.bleser@opensuse.org

- update 1.10.5:

    --file-allocation=none is specified

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct 12 14:18:34 UTC 2010 - pascal.bleser@opensuse.org

- update to 1.10.4:

    "226 Transfer Complete" message
  * fixes the bug in which the time used in file allocation is taken into
    account when calculating download speed
  * non UTF-8 filenames are now percent-encoded
  * the comments and name in the .torrent file in an XML-RPC response are also
    percent-encoded if they are not UTF-8
  * a warning message when CA certificates are not imported is not printed in
    the console; instead, it is shown when a certificate verification error
    actually occurs

  Discovery.  aria2.changeUri XML-RPC method was added. It enables you
  to add/remove URIs to existing downloads dynamically.  The user and
  password for proxy server now can be specified in command-line
  separately.  We refactored the code based on profiler results, so
  aria2 now runs more efficiently than ever. Russian and Simplified
  Chinese translation were updated.
  * Resurrected --http-proxy-user and --http-proxy-passwd option.
    Added --https-proxy-user, --https-proxy-passwd, --ftp-proxy-user,
    --ftp-proxy-passwd, --all-proxy-user, --all-proxy-passwd option.
  * Updated Russian and Simplified Chinese translation.
  * Added --reuse-uri option. This option has existed quite long, but
    been hidden.
  * Fixed the bug that filename is percent encoded where it must be
    percent decoded in sendMdtm().
  * Added getServers XML-RPC method. It returns currently connected
    HTTP(S)/FTP server and download speed, etc.
  * Added 'status' key to the response of getUri XML-RPC method.
  * Added changeUri XML-RPC method.  This method removes/adds URIs
    dynamically.
  * Replaced null or control characters in file path with '_'.  For
    MinGW32 build, additional characters which is not allowed in
    Windows kernel are also replaced. util::detectDirTraversal() now
    returns true if given string contains null or control characters.
  * Discard torrent file if path data in it contains directory
    traversal directives.  Discard metalink:file element in Metalink3
    format if its name attribute contains directory traversal
    directives.  Ignore name attribute of metalink:signature element in
    Metalink3 format if it contains directory traversal directives.
  * Added Metalink4 support. Files with same metaurl are
    grouped and downloaded in one RequestGroup.
  * Added --bt-lpd-interface option to specify the interface to use for
    Local Peer Discovery. LpdMessageDispatcher object now has its own
    socket. LpdMessageReceiver's socket is binded to multicast address
    to only receive multicast packets.
  * Added Local Peer Discovery. It is disabled by default. Use
    --bt-enable-lpd to enable the function.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb 11 19:16:08 CET 2009 - poeml@suse.de

- update to beta release 1.2.0b+20090210:
  This release adds the AdaptiveURISelector from Mandriva developers and
  changes the default value of --proxy-method option from 'tunnel' to
  'get'. The several BitTorrent options were added: limiting the number
  of peers, choosing port randomly from specified range, a toggle to
  seed after successful hash check and specifying IP address to report
  to a tracker. Hash checking is now done sequentially rather than
  simultaneously.  HTTP Authorization was also refined so that now
  authorization header is sent to the server only when it is
  requested(there are some exceptions, see Changes below). aria2 now
  returns exit code depending on the last error. All exit codes are
  documented in man page.  This release also adds experimental built-in
  HTTP server which provides the current download progress in plain
  html.
