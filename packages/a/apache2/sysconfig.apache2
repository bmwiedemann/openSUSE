## Description:	Configuration for Apache 2

## Type:	string
## Default:	""
## ServiceRestart: apache2
#
# Here you can name files, separated by spaces, that should be Include'd from 
# httpd.conf. 
#
# This allows you to add e.g. VirtualHost statements without touching 
# /etc/apache2/httpd.conf itself, which makes upgrading easier. 
#
APACHE_CONF_INCLUDE_FILES=""

## Type:	string
## Default:	""
## ServiceRestart: apache2
#
# Here you can name directories, separated by spaces, that should be Include'd 
# from httpd.conf. 
#
# All files contained in these directories will be recursively included by apache.
# If a pattern like *.conf is appended, apache will use it.
#
# Examples: "/etc/apache2/my_conf/"
#           "/etc/apache2/virtual_hosts/*.conf"
#           "local/*.conf /srv/www/virtual/"
#
APACHE_CONF_INCLUDE_DIRS=""

## Type:	string
## Default:	"actions alias auth_basic authn_file authz_host authz_groupfile authz_core authz_user autoindex cgi dir env expires include log_config mime negotiation setenvif ssl socache_shmcb userdir reqtimeout"
## ServiceRestart: apache2
#
# [It might look silly to not simply edit httpd.conf for the LoadModule statements.
# However, since the LoadModule statements might need an absolute path to the modules,
# switching between MPMs can be quite a hassle. It's easier to just give the names here.]
#
# * list of all modules shipped with the base distribution: 
#   see /usr/lib64/apache2-$MPM
#   see http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/ !
#
# * It pays to use IfDefine statements... like
#    <IfModule mod_xyz.c>
#        ....
#    </IfModule>
#
# * In the APACHE_MODULES variable, you can use mod_xyz or just xyz syntax.
#   You may also name an absolute path if you like.
#
# * NOTES ON SSL: 
#   1. Before you can use mod_ssl, you need a server certificate. 
#      A test certificate can be created by entering e. g.
#
#      $ gensslcert -n a.com
#
#      See gensslcert -h for or gensslcert script itself for details.
#   2. Also, you need to set the ServerName inside the <VirtualHost _default_:443> 
#      block to the fully qualified domain name (see /etc/HOSTNAME).
#   3. If your server certificate is protected by a passphrase you should increase the
#      APACHE_START_TIMEOUT (see above)
#   4. Consider to load also socache_shmcb module, see
#      http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_ssl.html#sslsessioncache
#      for details.
#   5. To finally enable ssl support, you need to add 'SSL' to APACHE_SERVER_FLAGS 
#      below.
#
# * modules listed here will be ignored if they are not installed
#
#
# EXAMPLES:
#
# fairly minimal
# APACHE_MODULES="authz_host alias auth dir log_config mime setenvif"
#
# apache's default installation
# APACHE_MODULES="authz_host actions alias asis auth autoindex cgi dir imap include log_config mime negotiation setenvif status userdir"
# your settings
APACHE_MODULES="actions alias auth_basic authn_core authn_file authz_host authz_groupfile authz_core authz_user autoindex cgi dir env expires include log_config mime negotiation setenvif ssl socache_shmcb userdir reqtimeout"

# Additional server flags:
#
# Put here any server flags ("Defines") that you want to hand over to 
# httpd at start time, or other command line flags.
#
# Background: Any directives within an <IfDefine flag>...</IfDefine>
#             section are only processed if the flag is defined.
#             This allows to write configuration which is active only in a
#             special cases, like during server maintenance, or for testing
#             something temporarily.
#
# Notably, to enable ssl support, 'SSL' needs to be added here.
#
# It does not matter if you write flag1, -D flag1 or -Dflag1.
# Multiple flags can be given as "-D flag1 -D flag2" or simply "flag1 flag2".
#
# Specifying such flags here is equivalent to giving them on the commandline.
# (e.g. via rcapache2 start -DReverseProxy)
#
# Example:
#      "SSL HTTP2 AWSTATS SVN_VIEWCVS no_subversion_today"

#
# If empty ("") it defaults to webmaster@$FQHOSTNAME, where FQHOSTNAME is

# ServerName gives the name and port that the server uses to identify itself.
# This can often be determined automatically, but we recommend you specify
# it explicitly to prevent problems during startup.
#
# If this is not set to valid DNS name for your host, server-generated
# redirections will not work.  See also the UseCanonicalName directive.
#
# If your host doesn't have a registered DNS name, enter its IP address here.
# You will have to access it by its address anyway, and this will make 
# redirections work in a sensible way.

# Simply set it to empty, if you configure it yourself somewhere else.

# Examples:
#
# If you would like to have agent and referer logfiles:
#
# setting it to "/var/log/apache2/referer_log referer, /var/log/apache2/agent_log agent"
#   corresponds to 
# CustomLog /var/log/apache2/referer_log referer
