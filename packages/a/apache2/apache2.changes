- Update to 2.4.58:
  *) SECURITY: CVE-2023-45802: Apache HTTP Server: HTTP/2 stream
     memory not reclaimed right away on RST (cve.mitre.org)
     When a HTTP/2 stream was reset (RST frame) by a client, there
     was a time window were the request's memory resources were not
     reclaimed immediately. Instead, de-allocation was deferred to
     connection close. A client could send new requests and resets,
     keeping the connection busy and open and causing the memory
     footprint to keep on growing. On connection close, all resources
     were reclaimed, but the process might run out of memory before
     that.
     This was found by the reporter during testing of CVE-2023-44487
     (HTTP/2 Rapid Reset Exploit) with their own test client. During
     "normal" HTTP/2 use, the probability to hit this bug is very
     low. The kept memory would not become noticeable before the
     connection closes or times out.
     Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.58, which fixes
     the issue.

  *) SECURITY: CVE-2023-43622: Apache HTTP Server: DoS in HTTP/2 with
     initial windows size 0 (cve.mitre.org)
     An attacker, opening a HTTP/2 connection with an initial window
     size of 0, was able to block handling of that connection
     indefinitely in Apache HTTP Server. This could be used to
     exhaust worker resources in the server, similar to the well
     known "slow loris" attack pattern.
     This has been fixed in version 2.4.58, so that such connection
     are terminated properly after the configured connection timeout.
     This issue affects Apache HTTP Server: from 2.4.55 through
     2.4.57.
     Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.58, which fixes
     the issue.

  *) mod_ssl: Silence info log message "SSL Library Error: error:0A000126:
     SSL routines::unexpected eof while reading" when using
     OpenSSL 3 by setting SSL_OP_IGNORE_UNEXPECTED_EOF if
     available. [Rainer Jung]

  *) mod_http2: improved early cleanup of streams.
     [Stefan Eissing]

  *) mod_proxy_http2: improved error handling on connection errors while
     response is already underway.
     [Stefan Eissing]

  *) mod_http2: fixed a bug that could lead to a crash in main connection
     output handling. This occured only when the last request on a HTTP/2
     connection had been processed and the session decided to shut down.
     This could lead to an attempt to send a final GOAWAY while the previous
     write was still in progress. See PR 66646.
     [Stefan Eissing]

  *) mod_proxy_http2: fix `X-Forward-Host` header to carry the correct value.
     Fixes PR66752.
     [Stefan Eissing]

  *) mod_http2: added support for bootstrapping WebSockets via HTTP/2, as
     described in RFC 8441. A new directive 'H2WebSockets on|off' has been
     added. The feature is by default not enabled.
     As also discussed in the manual, this feature should work for setups
     using "ProxyPass backend-url upgrade=websocket" without further changes.
     Special server modules for WebSockets will have to be adapted,
     most likely, as the handling if IO events is different with HTTP/2.
     HTTP/2 WebSockets are supported on platforms with native pipes. This
     excludes Windows.
     [Stefan Eissing]

  *) mod_rewrite: Fix a regression with both a trailing ? and [QSA].
     in OCSP stapling. PR 66672. [Frank Meier <frank.meier ergon.ch>, covener]

  *) mod_http2: fixed a bug in flushing pending data on an already closed
     connection that could lead to a busy loop, preventing the HTTP/2 session
     to close down successfully. Fixed PR 66624.
     [Stefan Eissing]

  *) mod_http2: v2.0.15 with the following fixes and improvements
     - New directive 'H2EarlyHint name value' to add headers to a response,
       picked up already when a "103 Early Hints" response is sent. 'name' and
       'value' must comply to the HTTP field restrictions.
       This directive can be repeated several times and header fields of the
       same names add. Sending a 'Link' header with 'preload' relation will
       also cause a HTTP/2 PUSH if enabled and supported by the client.
     - Fixed an issue where requests were not logged and accounted in a timely
       fashion when the connection returns to "keepalive" handling, e.g. when
       the request served was the last outstanding one.
       This led to late appearance in access logs with wrong duration times
       reported.
     - Accurately report the bytes sent for a request in the '%O' Log format.
       This addresses #203, a long outstanding issue where mod_h2 has reported
       numbers over-eagerly from internal buffering and not what has actually
       been placed on the connection.
       The numbers are now the same with and without H2CopyFiles enabled.
     [Stefan Eissing]

  *) mod_proxy_http2: fix retry handling to not leak temporary errors.
     On detecting that that an existing connection was shutdown by the other
     side, a 503 response leaked even though the request was retried on a
     fresh connection.
     [Stefan Eissing]

  *) mod_rewrite: Add server directory to include path as mod_rewrite requires
     test_char.h. PR 66571 [Valeria Petrov <valeria.petrov@spinetix.com>]

  *) mod_http2: new directive `H2ProxyRequests on|off` to enable handling
     of HTTP/2 requests in a forward proxy configuration.
     General forward proxying is enabled via `ProxyRequests`. If the
     HTTP/2 protocol is also enabled for such a server/host, this new
     directive is needed in addition.

  *) mod_proxy_http2: fixed using the wrong "bucket_alloc" from the backend
     connection when sending data on the frontend one. This caused crashes
     or infinite loops in rare situations.
  *) mod_proxy_http2: fixed a bug in retry/response handling that could lead
     to wrong status codes or HTTP messages send at the end of response bodies
     exceeding the announced content-length.
  *) mod_proxy_http2: fix retry handling to not leak temporary errors.
     On detecting that that an existing connection was shutdown by the other
     side, a 503 response leaked even though the request was retried on a

  *) mod_http2: fixed a bug that did cleanup of consumed and pending buckets in
     the wrong order when a bucket_beam was destroyed.

  *) mod_md:
     - New directive `MDMatchNames all|servernames` to allow more control over how
       MDomains are matched to VirtualHosts.
     - New directive `MDChallengeDns01Version`. Setting this to `2` will provide
       the command also with the challenge value on `teardown` invocation. In version
       1, the default, only the `setup` invocation gets this parameter.
       Refs #312. Thanks to @domrim for the idea.
     - For Managed Domain in "manual" mode, the checks if all used ServerName and
       ServerAlias are part of the MDomain now reports a warning instead of an error
       (AH10040) when not all names are present.
     - MDChallengeDns01 can now be configured for individual domains.

  *) mod_ldap: Avoid performance overhead of APR-util rebind cache for
     OpenLDAP 2.2+.  PR 64414.  [Joe Orton]

  *) mod_http2: new directive 'H2MaxDataFrameLen n' to limit the maximum
     amount of response body bytes put into a single HTTP/2 DATA frame.
     Setting this to 0 places no limit (but the max size allowed by the
     protocol is observed).
     The module, by default, tries to use the maximum size possible, which is
     somewhat around 16KB. This sets the maximum. When less response data is
     available, smaller frames will be sent.

  *) mod_md: fixed passing of the server environment variables to programs
     started via MDMessageCmd and MDChallengeDns01 on *nix system.
     See <https://github.com/icing/mod_md/issues/319>.

    *) mod_proxy_hcheck: Honor worker timeout settings.  [Yann Ylavic]

    *) mod_http2: version 2.0.10 of the module, synchronizing changes
      with the gitgub version. This is a partial rewrite of how connections
      and streams are handled.
      - an APR pollset and pipes (where supported) are used to monitor
        the main connection and react to IO for request/response handling.
        This replaces the stuttered timed waits of earlier versions.
      - H2SerializeHeaders directive still exists, but has no longer an effect.
      - Clients that seemingly misbehave still get less resources allocated,
        but ongoing requests are no longer disrupted.
      - Fixed an issue since 1.15.24 that "Server" headers in proxied requests
        were overwritten instead of preserved. [PR by @daum3ns]
      - A regression in v1.15.24 was fixed that could lead to httpd child
        processes not being terminated on a graceful reload or when reaching
        MaxConnectionsPerChild. When unprocessed h2 requests were queued at
        the time, these could stall. See #212.
      - Improved information displayed in 'server-status' for H2 connections when
        Extended Status is enabled. Now one can see the last request that IO
        operations happened on and transferred IO stats are updated as well.
      - When reaching server limits, such as MaxRequestsPerChild, the HTTP/2 connection
        send a GOAWAY frame much too early on new connections, leading to invalid
        protocol state and a client failing the request. See PR65731 at
        <https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=65731>.
        The module now initializes the HTTP/2 protocol correctly and allows the
        client to submit one request before the shutdown via a GOAWAY frame
        is being announced.
      - :scheme pseudo-header values, not matching the
        connection scheme, are forwarded via absolute uris to the
        http protocol processing to preserve semantics of the request.
        Checks on combinations of pseudo-headers values/absence
        have been added as described in RFC 7540. Fixes #230.
      - A bug that prevented trailers (e.g. HEADER frame at the end) to be
        generated in certain cases was fixed. See #233 where it prevented
        gRPC responses to be properly generated.
      - Request and response header values are automatically stripped of leading
        and trialing space/tab characters. This is equivalent behaviour to what
        Apache httpd's http/1.1 parser does.
        The checks for this in nghttp2 v1.50.0+ are disabled.

        on the v2.0.x versions for stability. Many thanks!

       hop-by-hop mechanism (cve.mitre.org)
       Apache HTTP Server 2.4.53 and earlier may not send the
       X-Forwarded-* headers to the origin server based on client side
       Connection header hop-by-hop mechanism.
       This may be used to bypass IP based authentication on the origin
       server/application.

    *) SECURITY: CVE-2022-30556: Information Disclosure in mod_lua with
       websockets (cve.mitre.org)
       Apache HTTP Server 2.4.53 and earlier may return lengths to
       applications calling r:wsread() that point past the end of the
       storage allocated for the buffer.

    *) SECURITY: CVE-2022-30522: mod_sed denial of service
       (cve.mitre.org)
       If Apache HTTP Server 2.4.53 is configured to do transformations
       with mod_sed in contexts where the input to mod_sed may be very
       large, mod_sed may make excessively large memory allocations and
       trigger an abort.

    *) SECURITY: CVE-2022-29404: Denial of service in mod_lua
       r:parsebody (cve.mitre.org)
       In Apache HTTP Server 2.4.53 and earlier, a malicious request to
       a lua script that calls r:parsebody(0) may cause a denial of
       service due to no default limit on possible input size.

    *) SECURITY: CVE-2022-28615: Read beyond bounds in
       ap_strcmp_match() (cve.mitre.org)
       Apache HTTP Server 2.4.53 and earlier may crash or disclose
       information due to a read beyond bounds in ap_strcmp_match()
       when provided with an extremely large input buffer.  While no
       code distributed with the server can be coerced into such a
       call, third-party modules or lua scripts that use
       ap_strcmp_match() may hypothetically be affected.

    *) SECURITY: CVE-2022-28614: read beyond bounds via ap_rwrite()
       (cve.mitre.org)
       The ap_rwrite() function in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.53 and
       earlier may read unintended memory if an attacker can cause the
       server to reflect very large input using ap_rwrite() or
       ap_rputs(), such as with mod_luas r:puts() function.

  *) mod_http: Correctly sent a 100 Continue status code when sending an interim
     response as result of an Expect: 100-Continue in the request and not the

  *) mod_dav: Some DAV extensions, like CalDAV, specify both document
     elements and property elements that need to be taken into account
     when generating a property. The document element and property element
     are made available in the dav_liveprop_elem structure by calling

     dav_find_attr() so that other modules get to play too.
  *) mpm_event: Restart stopping of idle children after a load peak
  *) mod_http2: fixes 2 regressions in server limit handling.
     1. When reaching server limits, such as MaxRequestsPerChild, the
        HTTP/2 connection send a GOAWAY frame much too early on new
        connections, leading to invalid protocol state and a client
        failing the request
        The module now initializes the HTTP/2 protocol correctly and
        allows the client to submit one request before the shutdown
        via a GOAWAY frame is being announced.
     2. A regression in v1.15.24 was fixed that could lead to httpd
        child processes not being terminated on a graceful reload or
        when reaching MaxConnectionsPerChild. When unprocessed h2
        requests were queued at the time, these could stall.

  *) mod_md: Fix memory leak in case of failures to load the private key.
  *) mod_md: adding v2.4.8 with the following changes
    - Added support for ACME External Account Binding (EAB).
      Use the new directive `MDExternalAccountBinding` to provide the
      server with the value for key identifier and hmac as provided by
      your CA.
      While working on some servers, EAB handling is not uniform
      across CAs. First tests with a Sectigo Certificate Manager in
      demo mode are successful. But ZeroSSL, for example, seems to
      regard EAB values as a one-time-use-only thing, which makes them
      fail if you create a seconde account or retry the creation of the
      first account with the same EAB.
    - The directive 'MDCertificateAuthority' now checks if its parameter
      is a http/https url or one of a set of known names. Those are
      'LetsEncrypt', 'LetsEncrypt-Test', 'Buypass' and 'Buypass-Test'
      for now and they are not case-sensitive.
      The default of LetsEncrypt is unchanged.
    - `MDContactEmail` can now be specified inside a `<MDomain dnsname>`
      section.
    - Treating 401 HTTP status codes for orders like 403, since some ACME
      servers seem to prefer that for accessing oders from other accounts.
    - When retrieving certificate chains, try to read the repsonse even
      if the HTTP Content-Type is unrecognized.
    - Fixed a bug that reset the error counter of a certificate renewal
      and prevented the increasing delays in further attempts.
    - Fixed the renewal process giving up every time on an already existing
      order with some invalid domains. Now, if such are seen in a previous
      order, a new order is created for a clean start over again.
      See <https://github.com/icing/mod_md/issues/268>
    - Fixed a mixup in md-status handler when static certificate files
      and renewal was configured at the same time.
  *) mod_md: values for External Account Binding (EAB) can
     now also be configured to be read from a separate JSON
     file. This allows to keep server configuration permissions
     world readable without exposing secrets.
  *) mod_proxy_uwsgi: Remove duplicate slashes at the beginning of PATH_INFO.

- version update to 2.4.49
  *) core/mod_proxy/mod_ssl:
     Adding `outgoing` flag to conn_rec, indicating a connection is
     initiated by the server to somewhere, in contrast to incoming
     connections from clients.
     Adding 'ap_ssl_bind_outgoing()` function that marks a connection
     as outgoing and is used by mod_proxy instead of the previous
     optional function `ssl_engine_set`. This enables other SSL
     module to secure proxy connections.
     The optional functions `ssl_engine_set`, `ssl_engine_disable` and
     `ssl_proxy_enable` are now provided by the core to have backward
     compatibility with non-httpd modules that might use them. mod_ssl
     itself no longer registers these functions, but keeps them in its
     header for backward compatibility.
     The core provided optional function wrap any registered function
     like it was done for `ssl_is_ssl`.

  Changes with Apache 2.4.48

  *) mod_proxy_wstunnel: Add ProxyWebsocketFallbackToProxyHttp to opt-out the
     fallback to mod_proxy_http for WebSocket upgrade and tunneling.
     [Yann Ylavic]

  *) mod_proxy: Fix flushing of THRESHOLD_MIN_WRITE data while tunneling.
     BZ 65294.  [Yann Ylavic]

  *) core: Fix a regression that stripped the ETag header from 304 responses.
     PR 61820 [Ruediger Pluem, Roy T. Fielding]

  *) core: Adding SSL related inquiry functions to the server API.
     These function are always available, even when no module providing
     SSL is loaded. They provide their own "shadowing" implementation for
     the optional functions of similar name that mod_ssl and impersonators
     of mod_ssl provide.
     This enables loading of several SSL providing modules when all but
     one of them registers itself into the new hooks. Two old-style SSL
     modules will not work, as they replace the others optional functions
     with their own.
     Modules using the old-style optional functions will continue to work
     as core supplies its own versions of those.
     The following has been added so far:
     - ap_ssl_conn_is_ssl() to query if a connection is using SSL.
     - ap_ssl_var_lookup() to query SSL related variables for a
       server/connection/request.
     - Hooks for 'ssl_conn_is_ssl' and 'ssl_var_lookup' where modules
       providing SSL can install their own value supplying functions.
     - ap_ssl_add_cert_files() to enable other modules like mod_md to provide
       certificate and keys for an SSL module like mod_ssl.
     - ap_ssl_add_fallback_cert_files() to enable other modules like mod_md to
       provide a fallback certificate in case no 'proper' certificate is
       available for an SSL module like mod_ssl.
     - ap_ssl_answer_challenge() to enable other modules like mod_md to
       provide a certificate as used in the RFC 8555 'tls-alpn-01' challenge
       for the ACME protocol for an SSL module like mod_ssl. The function
       and its hook provide PEM encoded data instead of file names.
     - Hooks for 'ssl_add_cert_files', 'ssl_add_fallback_cert_files' and
       'ssl_answer_challenge' where modules like mod_md can provide providers
       to the above mentioned functions.
     - These functions reside in the new 'http_ssl.h' header file.
     [Stefan Eissing]
  *) core/mod_ssl/mod_md: adding OCSP response provisioning as core feature. This
     allows modules to access and provide OCSP response data without being tied
     of each other. The data is exchanged in standard, portable formats (PEM encoded
     certificates and DER encoded responses), so that the actual SSL/crypto
     implementations used by the modules are independant of each other.
     Registration and retrieval happen in the context of a server (server_rec)
     which modules may use to decide if they are configured for this or not.
     The area of changes:
     1. core: defines 2 functions in include/http_ssl.h, so that modules may
        register a certificate, together with its issuer certificate for OCSP
        response provisioning and ask for current response data (DER bytes) later.
        Also, 2 hooks are defined that allow modules to implement this OCSP
        provisioning.
     2. mod_ssl uses the new functions, in addition to what it did already, to
        register its certificates this way. If no one is interested in providing
        OCSP, it falls back to its own (if configured) stapling implementation.
     3. mod_md registers itself at the core hooks for OCSP provisioning. Depending
        on configuration, it will accept registrations of its own certificates only,
        all certificates or none.
     [Stefan Eissing]
 *) mod_md: v2.4.0 with improvements and bugfixes
     - MDPrivateKeys allows the specification of several types. Beside "RSA" plus
     optional key lengths elliptic curves can be configured. This means you can
     have multiple certificates for a Managed Domain with different key types.
     With ```MDPrivateKeys secp384r1 rsa2048``` you get one ECDSA  and one RSA
     certificate and all modern client will use the shorter ECDSA, while older
     client will get the RSA certificate.
     Many thanks to @tlhackque who pushed and helped on this.
     - Support added for MDomains consisting of a wildcard. Configuring
     ```MDomain *.host.net``` will match all virtual hosts matching that pattern
     and obtain one certificate for it (assuming you have 'dns-01' challenge
     support configured). Addresses #239.
     - Removed support for ACMEv1 servers. The only known installation used to
     be Let's Encrypt which has disabled that version more than a year ago for
     new accounts.
     - Andreas Ulm (<https://github.com/root360-AndreasUlm>) implemented the
     ```renewing``` call to ```MDMessageCmd``` that can deny a certificate
     renewal attempt. This is useful in clustered installations, as
     discussed in #233).
     - New event ```challenge-setup:<type>:<domain>```, triggered when the
     challenge data for a domain has been created. This is invoked before the
     ACME server is told to check for it. The type is one of the ACME challenge
     types. This is invoked for every DNS name in a MDomain.
     - The max delay for retries has been raised to daily (this is like all
     retries jittered somewhat to avoid repeats at fixed time of day).
     - Certain error codes reported by the ACME server that indicate a problem
     with the configured data now immediately switch to daily retries. For
     example: if the ACME server rejects a contact email or a domain name,
     frequent retries will most likely not solve the problem. But daily retries
     still make sense as there might be an error at the server and un-supervised
     certificate renewal is the goal. Refs #222.
     - Test case and work around for domain names > 64 octets. Fixes #227.
     When the first DNS name of an MD is longer than 63 octets, the certificate
     request will not contain a CN field, but leave it up to the CA to choose one.
     Currently, Lets Encrypt looks for a shorter name in the SAN list given and
     fails the request if none is found. But it is really up to the CA (and what
     browsers/libs accept here) and may change over the years. That is why
     the decision is best made at the CA.
     - Retry delays now have a random +/-[0-50]% modification applied to let
     retries from several servers spread out more, should they have been
     restarted at the same time of day.
     - Fixed several places where the 'badNonce' return code from an ACME server
     was not handled correctly. The test server 'pebble' simulates this behaviour
     by default and helps nicely in verifying this behaviour. Thanks, pebble!
     - Set the default `MDActivationDelay` to 0. This was confusing to users that
     new certificates were deemed not usably before a day of delay. When clocks are
     correct, using a new certificate right away should not pose a problem.
     - When handling ACME authorization resources, the module no longer requires
     the server to return a "Location" header, as was necessary in ACMEv1.
     Fixes #216.
     - Fixed a theoretical uninitialized read when testing for JSON error responses
     from the ACME CA. Reported at <https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=64297>.
     - ACME problem reports from CAs that include parameters in the Content-Type
     header are handled correctly. (Previously, the problem text would not be
     reported and retries could exceed CA limits.)
     - Account Update transactions to V2 CAs now use the correct POST-AS-GET method.
     Previously, an empty JSON object was sent - which apparently LE accepted,
     but others reject.

       The default is on, which is the behaviour of older mod-h2 versions. When off, all
       bytes are made available immediately to the main connection for sending them
       out to the client. This fixes interop issues with certain flavours of gRPC, see

       generated using a file digest.
     - Add ap_make_etag_ex() and ap_set_etag_fd() to allow full control over
       ETag generation.
     - Add concept of "binary notes" to request_rec, allowing packed bit flags
       to be added to a request.
     - First binary note - AP_REQUEST_STRONG_ETAG - allows modules to force
       the ETag to a strong ETag to comply with RFC requirements, such as those

- version update to 2.4.46
  Changes with Apache 2.4.46
  *) mod_proxy_fcgi: Fix build warnings for Windows platform
     [Eric Covener, Christophe Jaillet]
  Changes with Apache 2.4.45
  *) mod_http2: remove support for abandoned http-wg draft
     <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-kazuho-h2-cache-digest/>.
     [Stefan Eissing]
  Changes with Apache 2.4.44
  *) mod_proxy_uwsgi: Error out on HTTP header larger than 16K (hard
     protocol limit).  [Yann Ylavic]
  *) mod_http2:
     Fixes <https://github.com/icing/mod_h2/issues/200>:
     "LimitRequestFields 0" now disables the limit, as documented.
     Fixes <https://github.com/icing/mod_h2/issues/201>:
     Do not count repeated headers with same name against the field
     count limit. The are merged internally, as if sent in a single HTTP/1 line.
     [Stefan Eissing]
  *) mod_http2: Avoid segfaults in case of handling certain responses for
     already aborted connections.  [Stefan Eissing, Ruediger Pluem]
  *) mod_http2: The module now handles master/secondary connections and has marked
     methods according to use. [Stefan Eissing]
  *) core: Drop an invalid Last-Modified header value coming
     from a FCGI/CGI script instead of replacing it with Unix epoch.
     [Yann Ylavic, Luca Toscano]
  *) Add support for strict content-length parsing through addition of
     ap_parse_strict_length() [Yann Ylavic]
  *) mod_proxy_fcgi: ProxyFCGISetEnvIf unsets variables when expression
     evaluates to false.  PR64365. [Michael König <mail ikoenig.net>]
  *) mod_proxy_http: flush spooled request body in one go to avoid
     leaking (or long lived) temporary file. PR 64452. [Yann Ylavic]
  *) mod_ssl: Fix a race condition and possible crash when using a proxy client
     certificate (SSLProxyMachineCertificateFile).
     [Armin Abfalterer <a.abfalterer gmail.com>]
  *) mod_ssl: Fix memory leak in stapling code. PR63687. [Stefan Eissing]
  *) mod_http2: Fixed regression that no longer set H2_STREAM_ID and H2_STREAM_TAG.
     PR64330 [Stefan Eissing]
  *) mod_http2: Fixed regression that caused connections to close when mod_reqtimeout
     was configured with a handshake timeout. Fixes gitub issue #196.
     [Stefan Eissing]
  *) mod_proxy_http2: the "ping" proxy parameter
     (see <https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_proxy.html>) is now used
     when checking the liveliness of a new or reused h2 connection to the backend.
     With short durations, this makes load-balancing more responsive. The module
     will hold back requests until ping conditions are met, using features of the
     HTTP/2 protocol alone. [Ruediger Pluem, Stefan Eissing]
  *) core: httpd is no longer linked against -lsystemd if mod_systemd
     is enabled (and built as a DSO).  [Rainer Jung]
  *) mod_proxy_http2: respect ProxyTimeout settings on backend connections
     while waiting on incoming data. [Ruediger Pluem, Stefan Eissing]

- version update to 2.4.43
  *) mod_ssl: Fix memory leak of OCSP stapling response. [Yann Ylavic]
  *) mod_proxy_http: Fix the forwarding of requests with content body when a
     balancer member is unavailable; the retry on the next member was issued
     with an empty body (regression introduced in 2.4.41). PR63891.
     [Yann Ylavic]
  *) mod_http2: Fixes issue where mod_unique_id would generate non-unique request
     identifier under load, see <https://github.com/icing/mod_h2/issues/195>.
     [Michael Kaufmann, Stefan Eissing]
  *) mod_proxy_hcheck: Allow healthcheck expressions to use %{Content-Type}.
     PR64140. [Renier Velazco <renier.velazco upr.edu>]
  *) mod_authz_groupfile: Drop AH01666 from loglevel "error" to "info".
     PR64172.
  *) mod_usertrack: Add CookieSameSite, CookieHTTPOnly, and CookieSecure
     to allow customization of the usertrack cookie. PR64077.
     [Prashant Keshvani <prashant2400 gmail.com>, Eric Covener]
  *) mod_proxy_ajp: Add "secret" parameter to proxy workers to implement legacy
     AJP13 authentication.  PR 53098. [Dmitry A. Bakshaev <dab1818 gmail com>]
  *) mpm_event: avoid possible KeepAliveTimeout off by -100 ms.
     [Eric Covener, Yann Ylavic]
  *) Add a config layout for OpenWRT. [Graham Leggett]
  *) Add support for cross compiling to apxs. If apxs is being executed from
     somewhere other than its target location, add that prefix to includes and
     library directories. Without this, apxs would fail to find config_vars.mk
     and exit. [Graham Leggett]
  *) mod_ssl: Disable client verification on ACME ALPN challenges. Fixes github
     issue mod_md#172 (https://github.com/icing/mod_md/issues/172).
     [Michael Kaufmann <mail michael-kaufmann.ch>, Stefan Eissing]
  *) mod_ssl: use OPENSSL_init_ssl() to initialise OpenSSL on versions 1.1+.
     [Graham Leggett]
  *) mod_ssl: Support use of private keys and certificates from an
     OpenSSL ENGINE via PKCS#11 URIs in SSLCertificateFile/KeyFile.
     [Anderson Sasaki <ansasaki redhat.com>, Joe Orton]
  *) mod_md:
     - Prefer MDContactEmail directive to ServerAdmin for registration. New directive
       thanks to Timothe Litt (@tlhackque).
     - protocol check for pre-configured "tls-alpn-01" challenge has been improved. It will now
       check all matching virtual hosts for protocol support. Thanks to @mkauf.
     - Corrected a check when OCSP stapling was configured for hosts
       where the responsible MDomain is not clear, by Michal Karm Babacek (@Karm).
     - Softening the restrictions where mod_md configuration directives may appear. This should
       allow for use in <If> and <Macro> sections. If all possible variations lead to the configuration
       you wanted in the first place, is another matter.
     [Michael Kaufmann <mail michael-kaufmann.ch>, Timothe Litt (@tlhackque),
      Michal Karm Babacek (@Karm), Stefan Eissing (@icing)]
  *) test: Added continuous testing with Travis CI.
     This tests various scenarios on Ubuntu with the full test suite.
     Architectures tested: amd64, s390x, ppc64le, arm64
     The tests pass successfully.
     [Luca Toscano, Joe Orton, Mike Rumph, and others]
  *) core: Be stricter in parsing of Transfer-Encoding headers.
     [ZeddYu <zeddyu.lu gmail.com>, Eric Covener]
  *) mod_ssl: negotiate the TLS protocol version per name based vhost
     configuration, when linked with OpenSSL-1.1.1 or later. The base vhost's
     SSLProtocol (from the first vhost declared on the IP:port) is now only
     relevant if no SSLProtocol is declared for the vhost or globally,
     otherwise the vhost or global value apply.  [Yann Ylavic]
  *) mod_cgi, mod_cgid: Fix a memory leak in some error cases with large script
     output.  PR 64096.  [Joe Orton]
  *) config: Speed up graceful restarts by using pre-hashed command table. PR 64066.
     [Giovanni Bechis <giovanni paclan.it>, Jim Jagielski]
  *) mod_systemd: New module providing integration with systemd.  [Jan Kaluza]
  *) mod_lua: Add r:headers_in_table, r:headers_out_table, r:err_headers_out_table,
     r:notes_table, r:subprocess_env_table as read-only native table alternatives
     that can be iterated over. [Eric Covener]
  *) mod_http2: Fixed rare cases where a h2 worker could deadlock the main connection.
     [Yann Ylavic, Stefan Eissing]
  *) mod_lua: Accept nil assignments to the exposed tables (r.subprocess_env,
     r.headers_out, etc) to remove the key from the table. PR63971.
     [Eric Covener]
  *) mod_http2: Fixed interaction with mod_reqtimeout. A loaded mod_http2 was disabling the
     ssl handshake timeouts. Also, fixed a mistake of the last version that made `H2Direct`
     always `on`, regardless of configuration. Found and reported by
     <Armin.Abfalterer@united-security-providers.ch> and
     <Marcial.Rion@united-security-providers.ch>. [Stefan Eissing]
  *) mod_http2: Multiple field length violations in the same request no longer cause
     several log entries to be written. [@mkauf]
  *) mod_ssl: OCSP does not apply to proxy mode.  PR 63679.
     [Lubos Uhliarik <luhliari redhat.com>, Yann Ylavic]
  *) mod_proxy_html, mod_xml2enc: Fix build issues with macOS due to r1864469
     [Jim Jagielski]
  *) mod_authn_socache: Increase the maximum length of strings that can be cached by
     the module from 100 to 256.  PR 62149 [<thorsten.meinl knime.com>]
  *) mod_proxy: Fix crash by resolving pool concurrency problems. PR 63503
     [Ruediger Pluem, Eric Covener]
  *) core: On Windows, fix a start-up crash if <IfFile ...> is used with a path that is not
     valid (For example, testing for a file on a flash drive that is not mounted)
     [Christophe Jaillet]
  *) mod_deflate, mod_brotli: honor "Accept-Encoding: foo;q=0" as per RFC 7231; which
     means 'foo' is "not acceptable".  PR 58158 [Chistophe Jaillet]
  *) mod_md v2.2.3:
     - Configuring MDCAChallenges replaces any previous existing challenge configuration. It
       had been additive before which was not the intended behaviour. [@mkauf]
     - Fixing order of ACME challenges used when nothing else configured. Code now behaves as
       documented for `MDCAChallenges`. Fixes #156. Thanks again to @mkauf for finding this.
     - Fixing a potential, low memory null pointer dereference [thanks to @uhliarik].
     - Fixing an incompatibility with a change in libcurl v7.66.0 that added unwanted
       "transfer-encoding" to POST requests. This failed in directy communication with
       Let's Encrypt boulder server. Thanks to @mkauf for finding and fixing. [Stefan Eissing]
  *) mod_md: Adding the several new features.
     The module offers an implementation of OCSP Stapling that can replace fully or
     for a limited set of domains the existing one from mod_ssl. OCSP handling
     is part of mod_md's monitoring and message notifications. If can be used
     for sites that do not have ACME certificates.
     The url for a CTLog Monitor can be configured. It is used in the server-status
     to link to the external status page of a certicate.
     The MDMessageCmd is called with argument "installed" when a new certificate
     has been activated on server restart/reload. This allows for processing of
     the new certificate, for example to applications that require it in different
     locations or formats.

  * mod_proxy/ssl: Cleanup per-request SSL configuration anytime a
    backend connection is recycled/reused to avoid a possible crash
    with some SSLProxy configurations in <Location> or <Proxy>
    context. PR 63256. [Yann Ylavic]
  * mod_ssl: Correctly restore SSL verify state after TLSv1.3 PHA
    failure. [Michael Kaufmann <mail michael-kaufmann.ch>]
  * mod_log_config: Support %{c}h for conn-hostname, %h for
    useragent_host PR 55348
  * mod_socache_redis: Support for Redis as socache storage
    provider.
  * core: new configuration option 'MergeSlashes on|off' that
    controls handling of multiple, consecutive slash ('/')
    characters in the path component of the request URL. [Eric
    Covener]
  * mod_http2: when SSL renegotiation is inhibited and a 403
    ErrorDocument is in play, the proper HTTP/2 stream reset did
    not trigger with H2_ERR_HTTP_1_1_REQUIRED. Fixed. [Michael
    Kaufmann]
  * mod_http2: new configuration directive: `H2Padding numbits` to
    control padding of HTTP/2 payload frames. 'numbits' is a number
    from 0-8, controlling the range of padding bytes added to a
    frame. The actual number added is chosen randomly per frame.
    This applies to HEADERS, DATA and PUSH_PROMISE frames equally.
    The default continues to be 0, e.g. no padding. [Stefan
    Eissing]
  * mod_http2: ripping out all the h2_req_engine internal features
    now that mod_proxy_http2 has no more need for it. Optional
    functions are still declared but no longer implemented. While
    previous mod_proxy_http2 will work with this, it is
    recommeneded to run the matching versions of both modules.
    [Stefan Eissing]
  * mod_proxy_http2: changed mod_proxy_http2 implementation and
    fixed several bugs which resolve PR63170. The proxy module does
    now a single h2 request on the (reused) connection and returns.
    [Stefan Eissing]
  * mod_http2/mod_proxy_http2: proxy_http2 checks correct master
    connection aborted status to trigger immediate shutdown of
    backend connections. This is now always signalled by mod_http2
    when the the session is being released. proxy_http2 now only
    sends a PING frame to the backend when there is not already one
    in flight. [Stefan Eissing]
  * mod_proxy_http2: fixed an issue where a proxy_http2 handler
    entered an infinite loop when encountering certain errors on
    the backend connection. See
    <https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=63170>. [Stefan
    Eissing]
  * mod_http2: Configuration directives H2Push and H2Upgrade can
    now be specified per Location/Directory, e.g. disabling PUSH
    for a specific set of resources. [Stefan Eissing]
  * mod_http2: HEAD requests to some module such as mod_cgid caused
    the stream to terminate improperly and cause a HTTP/2
    PROTOCOL_ERROR. Fixes
    <https://github.com/icing/mod_h2/issues/167>. [Michael
    Kaufmann]
  * http: Fix possible empty response with mod_ratelimit for HEAD
    requests. PR 63192. [Yann Ylavic]
  * mod_cache_socache: Avoid reallocations and be safe with
    outgoing data lifetime. [Yann Ylavic]

  * distributed httpd.conf no longer includes sysconfig.d, nor this
    directory is shipped. httpd.conf includes loadmodule.conf and
    global.conf which are former sysconfig.d/loadmodule.conf and
    sysconfig.d/global.conf for default /etc/sysconfig/apache2
    global.conf and loadmodule.conf are not included when
    sysconfig variables could have been read by start_apache2
    startup script (run with systemd services). Therefore, when
    starting server via /usr/sbin/httpd, sysconfig variables
    are not taken into account.
  * some not-maintained scripts are moved from
    /usr/share/apache2 to /usr/share/apache2/deprecated-scripts

- add SSLHonorCipherOrder directive to apache2-ssl-global.conf
- adopt SSLCipherSuite directive value from SLE12
- remove default-vhost-ssl.conf and default-vhost.conf from
  /etc/apache2. These two files are not (!) read by the
  configuration framework, but are named *.conf, which is
  misleading. The files are almost identical with the vhost
  templates in /etc/apache2/vhosts.d/. The two templates there do
  it right because they are not named *.conf and are not sourced
  either. apache's response with no explicit (eg. default, vanilla)
  configuration is contained in /etc/apache2/default-server.conf.
  * remove apache2-README.default-vhost as there are no
    default-vhost* files anymore.

     core: HTTP trailers could be used to replace HTTP headers

     The directive controls the use of TLS session tickets (RFC 5077),

     Session ticket creation uses a random key created during web
     server startup and recreated during restarts. No other key
     recreation mechanism is available currently. Therefore using session

- update to apache 2.4.7, important changes:

* This release requires both apr and apr-util 1.5.x series
  and therefore will no longer build in older released products

  (obsoletes httpd-mod_ssl_ephemeralkeyhandling.patch)
* event MPM: Fix possible crashes
* mod_deflate: Improve error detection
* core: Add open_htaccess hook  in conjunction with dirwalk_stat.
* mod_rewrite: Make rewrite websocket-aware to allow proxying.
* mod_ssl: drop support for export-grade ciphers with ephemeral RSA
  keys, and unconditionally disable aNULL, eNULL and EXP ciphers
  (not overridable via SSLCipherSuite)

  sense of a poll event from a read to a write or vice versa
  (obsoletes httpd-event-ssl.patch)

- Fix SUSE spelling.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep  3 15:37:37 UTC 2013 - crrodriguez@opensuse.org

  we really mean -DFOREGROUND not -DNO_DETACH the latter only
  inhibits the parent from forking, not quite the same as
  running in well.. the foreground as required.

- upgrade: some people complain that log_config module
 is not enabled by default sometimes, fix that.
- upgrade : "SSLMutex" no longer exists.
- Toogle EnableSendfile on because now apache defaults to off
  due to kernel bugs. that's a silly thing to do here
  as kernel bugs have to be fixed at their source, not worked around
  in applications.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul 22 21:57:40 UTC 2013 - crrodriguez@opensuse.org

- httpd-event-ssl.patch: from upstream

*  As well as several exciting fixes, especially those related to RFC edge
 cases in mod_cache and mod_proxy.

- IMPORTANT : With the current packaging scheme, we can no longer
Include the ITK MPM, therefore it has been disabled. This is because
this MPM can now only be provided as a loadable module but we do
not currently build MPMs as shared modules but as independant
binaries and all helpers/startup scripts depend on that behaviour.
It will be fixed in the upcoming weeks/months.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun 18 07:41:36 UTC 2013 - crrodriguez@opensuse.org

  *) SECURITY: CVE-2011-3368 (cve.mitre.org)
     Reject requests where the request-URI does not match the HTTP
     specification, preventing unexpected expansion of target URLs in
     some reverse proxy configurations.
  *) SECURITY: CVE-2011-3607 (cve.mitre.org)
     Fix integer overflow in ap_pregsub() which, when the mod_setenvif module
     is enabled, could allow local users to gain privileges via a .htaccess
     file.
  *) SECURITY: CVE-2011-4317 (cve.mitre.org)
     Resolve additional cases of URL rewriting with ProxyPassMatch or
     RewriteRule, where particular request-URIs could result in undesired
     backend network exposure in some configurations.
  *) SECURITY: CVE-2012-0021 (cve.mitre.org)
     mod_log_config: Fix segfault (crash) when the '%{cookiename}C' log format
     string is in use and a client sends a nameless, valueless cookie, causing
     a denial of service. The issue existed since version 2.2.17. PR 52256.
  *) SECURITY: CVE-2012-0031 (cve.mitre.org)
     Fix scoreboard issue which could allow an unprivileged child process
     could cause the parent to crash at shutdown rather than terminate
     cleanly.
  *) SECURITY: CVE-2012-0053 (cve.mitre.org)
     Fix an issue in error responses that could expose "httpOnly" cookies
     when no custom ErrorDocument is specified for status code 400.

     all vars from 3rd-party modules will be fixed. PR 13029 / 34985.
  *) core: Fix hook sorting for Perl modules, a regression introduced in
     2.2.21. PR: 45076.

  *) Example configuration: Fix entry for MaxRanges (use "unlimited" instead
     of "0").
  *) mod_substitute: Fix buffer overrun.

Tue Jan  9 15:59:42 CET 2007 - poeml@suse.de

- upstream 2.2.4
  mod_authnz_ldap:
   - Add an AuthLDAPRemoteUserAttribute directive. If set,
     REMOTE_USER will be set to this attribute, rather than the
     username supplied by the user. Useful for example when you
     want users to log in using an email address, but need to
     supply a userid instead to the backend.
  mod_cache:
   - From RFC3986 (section 6.2.3.) if a URI contains an authority
     component and an empty path, the empty path is to be
     equivalent to "/". It explicitly cites the following four URIs
     as equivalents:
       http://example.com
       http://example.com/
       http://example.com:/
       http://example.com:80/
   - Eliminate a bogus error in the log when a filter returns
     AP_FILTER_ERROR.
   - Don't cache requests with a expires date in the past;
     otherwise mod_cache will always try to cache the URL. This bug
     might lead to numerous rename() errors on win32 if the URL was
     previously cached.
  mod_cgi and mod_cgid:
   - Don't use apr_status_t error return from input filters as HTTP
     return value from the handler.  PR 31579.
  mod_dbd:
   - share per-request database handles across subrequests and
     internal redirects
   - key connection pools to virtual hosts correctly even when
     ServerName is unset/unavailable
  mod_deflate:
   - Rework inflate output and deflate output filter to fix several
     issues: Incorrect handling of flush buckets, potential memory
     leaks, excessive memory usage in inflate output filter for
     large compressed content. PR 39854.
  mod_disk_cache:
   - Make sure that only positive integers are accepted for the
     CacheMaxFileSize and CacheMinFileSize parameters in the config
     file. PR39380.
  mod_dumpio:
   - Allow mod_dumpio to log at other than DEBUG levels via the new
     DumpIOLogLevel directive.
  mod_echo:
   - Fix precedence problem in if statement. PR 40658.
  mod_ext_filter:
   - Handle filter names which include capital letters.  PR 40323.
  mod_headers:
   - Support regexp-based editing of HTTP headers.
  mod_mime_magic:
   - Fix precedence problem in if statement. PR 40656.
  mod_mem_cache:
   - Memory leak fix: Unconditionally free the buffer.
   - Convert mod_mem_cache to use APR memory pool functions by
     creating a root pool for object persistence across requests.
     This also eliminates the need for custom serialization code.
  mod_proxy:
   - Don't try to use dead backend connection. PR 37770.
   - Add explicit flushing feature. When Servlet container sends
     AJP body message with size 0, this means that Servlet
     container has asked for an explicit flush. Create flush bucket
     in that case. This feature has been added to the recent Tomcat
     versions without breaking the AJP protocol.
  mod_proxy_ajp:
   - Close connection to backend if reading of request body fails.
     PR 40310.
   - Added cping/cpong support for the AJP protocol.  A new worker
     directive ping=timeout will cause CPING packet to be send
     expecting CPONG packet within defined timeout.  In case the
     backend is too busy this will fail instead sending the full
     header.
  mod_proxy_balancer:
   - Workers can now be defined as part of a balancer cluster "set"
     in which members of a lower-numbered set are preferred over
     higher numbered ones.
   - Workers can now be defined as "hot standby" which will only be
     used if all other workers are unusable (eg: in error or
     disabled). Also, the balancer-manager displays the election
     count and I/O counts of all workers.
   - Retry worker chosen by route / redirect worker if it is in
     error state before sending "Service Temporarily Unavailable".
     PR 38962.
   - Extract stickysession routing information contained as
     parameter in the URL correctly. PR 40400.
   - Set the new environment variable BALANCER_ROUTE_CHANGED if a
     worker with a route different from the one supplied by the
     client had been chosen or if the client supplied no routing
     information for a balancer with sticky sessions.
   - Add information about the route, the sticky session and the
     worker used during a request as environment variables. PR
     39806.
  core:
   - Fix issue which could cause piped loggers to be orphaned and
     never terminate after a graceful restart.  PR 40651.
   - Fix address-in-use startup failure caused by corruption of the
     list of listen sockets in some configurations with multiple
     generic Listen directives.
   - Fix NONBLOCK status of listening sockets on restart/graceful
     PR 37680.
   - Deal with the widespread use of apr_status_t return values as
     HTTP status codes, as documented in PR#31759 (a bug shared by
     the default handler, mod_cgi, mod_cgid, mod_proxy, and
     probably others). PR31759.
   - The full server version information is now included in the
     error log at startup as well as server status reports,
     irrespective of the setting of the ServerTokens directive.
     ap_get_server_version() is now deprecated, and is replaced by
     ap_get_server_banner() and ap_get_server_description().
  misc:
   - Allow htcacheclean, httxt2dbm, and fcgistarter to link
     apr/apr-util statically like the older support programs.
   - Better detection and clean up of ldap connection that has been
     terminated by the ldap server.  PR 40878.

  | SECURITY: CAN-2005-2700 (cve.mitre.org)
  |    mod_ssl: Fix a security issue where "SSLVerifyClient" was
  |    not enforced in per-location context if "SSLVerifyClient
  |    optional" was configured in the vhost configuration.
  | SECURITY: CAN-2005-2491 (cve.mitre.org):

  | SECURITY: CAN-2005-2088 (cve.mitre.org)
  |    proxy: Correctly handle the Transfer-Encoding and

  |    whenever T-E: chunked is used, always passing one of either
  |    C-L or T-E: chunked whenever the request includes a request

  |    Splitting/Spoofing attacks.
  | SECURITY: CAN-2005-2728 (cve.mitre.org)

  |  - Added TraceEnable [on|off|extended] per-server directive to
  |    alter the behavior of the TRACE method.  This addresses a
  |    flaw in proxy conformance to RFC 2616 - previously the proxy
  |    server would accept a TRACE request body although the RFC
  |    prohibited it.  The default remains 'TraceEnable on'.

- when building the suexec binary, set the "docroot" compile time
  option to the datadir (/srv/www) instead of the htdocsdir
  (/srv/www/htdocs), so it can be used with virtual hosts placed
  e.g. in /srv/www/vhosts [#63845] Suggested by Winfried Kuiper.

  by installing the package. Suppress warning about not-found
  module in the php4/php5 case. [#66729]
- remove a redundant get_module_list call from the init script
- add hints about vhost setup to README.QUICKSTART
- after a change of APACHE_MPM, apache2-reconfigure-mpm is no
  longer needed since SuSEconfig.apache2 is gone. Leave it for
  compatibility, because /etc/sysconfig/apache2 is probably not
  updated and yast may still use it.
- move the 4 most important variables in sysconfig.apache2 to the
  top of the file

- update to 2.0.52. Relevant changes:
  | SECURITY: CAN-2004-0811 (cve.mitre.org)
  |   Fix merging of the Satisfy directive, which was applied to
  |   the surrounding context and could allow access despite configured
  |   authentication.  PR 31315.
  | util_ldap:
  |   Fix a segfault in the LDAP cache when it is configured switched off.
  | mod_mem_cache:
  |   Fixed race condition causing segfault because of memory being

  |   triggered if using "speculative" mode, for instance by a proxy
  |   request to an SSL server.  PR 30134.
  | SECURITY: CAN-2004-0748 (cve.mitre.org)
  |   mod_ssl: Fix a potential infinite loop.  PR 29964.
  | mod_include:
  |   no longer checks for recursion, because that's done in the core.
  |   This allows for careful usage of recursive SSI.
  | mod_rewrite:
  |  - Fix memory leak in the cache handlingof mod_rewrite. PR 27862.
  |  - Add %{SSL:...} and %{HTTPS} variable lookups.  PR 30464.

  |    of hooks.
  | mod_disk_cache:
  |  - Implement binary format for on-disk header files.
  |  - Optimize network performance of disk cache subsystem by allowing
  |    zero-copy (sendfile) writes and other miscellaneous fixes.

  |  - Ensure that the userdir identity is used for suexec userdir
  |    access in a virtual host which has suexec configured.  PR 18156.
  | mod_setenvif:
  |  - Remove "support" for Remote_User variable which never worked at
  |    all. PR 25725.
  |  - Extend the SetEnvIf directive to capture subexpressions of the
  |    matched value.
  | mod_headers:
  |  - Backport from 2.1 / Regression from 1.3: mod_headers now knows
  |    again the functionality of the ErrorHeader directive. But
  |    instead using this misnomer additional flags to the Header
  |    directive were introduced ("always" and "onsuccess", defaulting
  |    to the latter).  PR 28657.
  | mod_usertrack:
  |  - Escape the cookie name before pasting into the regexp.
  | mod_dir:
  |  - the trailing-slash behaviour is now configurable using the
  |    DirectorySlash directive.
  | util_ldap:
  |  - Switched the lock types on the shared memory cache from thread
  |    reader/writer locks to global mutexes in order to provide cross

  |  - Enhanced the util_ldap cache-info display to show more detail
  |    about the contents and current state of the cache.
  | mod_ldap:
  |  - Enable the option to support anonymous shared memory in
  |    mod_ldap.  This makes the cache work on Linux again.
  | miscellaneous:
  |  - Include directives no longer refuse to process symlinks on
  |    directories. Instead there's now a maximum nesting level of
  |    included directories (128 as distributed). This is configurable
  |    at compile time using the -DAP_MAX_INCLUDE_DIR_DEPTH switch.  PR
  |    28492, PR 28370.
  |  - Prevent CGI script output which includes a Content-Range header
  |    from being passed through the byterange filter.
  |  - Satisfy directives now can be influenced by a surrounding

  |    platforms except FreeBSD < 4.1.1.
  |  - Allow proxying of resources that are invoked via DirectoryIndex.
  |    PR 14648, 15112, 29961.
  |  - Small fix to allow reverse proxying to an ftp server. Previously
  |    an attempt to do this would try and connect to 0.0.0.0,

  |    address.  PR 28174.
  |  - initialize server arrays prior to calling
  |    ap_setup_prelinked_modules so that static modules can push

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul  8 14:17:13 CEST 2004 - poeml@suse.de

- update to 2.0.50. Relevant changes:
  | SECURITY: CAN-2004-0493 (cve.mitre.org)
  |   Close a denial of service vulnerability identified by Georgi
  |   Guninski which could lead to memory exhaustion with certain
  |   input data.
  | SECURITY: CAN-2004-0488 (cve.mitre.org)
  |   mod_ssl: Fix a buffer overflow in the FakeBasicAuth code for
  |   a (trusted) client certificate subject DN which exceeds 6K in
  |   length.
  | mod_alias:
  |   now emits a warning if it detects overlapping *Alias* directives.
  | mod_cgi: Handle output on stderr during script execution on Unix
  |   platforms; preventing deadlock when stderr output fills pipe
  |   buffer.  Also fixes case where stderr from nph- scripts could be
  |   lost.  PR 22030, 18348.
  | mod_dav:
  |  - Fix a problem that could cause crashes when manipulating locks
  |    on some platforms.
  | mod_dav_fs:
  |  - Fix MKCOL response for missing parent collections, which caused
  |    issues for the Eclipse WebDAV extension.  PR 29034.
  | mod_deflate:
  |  - Fix memory consumption (which was proportional to the response
  |    size).  PR 29318.
  | mod_expires:
  |  - Fix segfault which occured under certain circumstances. PR 28047.
  | mod_headers:
  |  - no longer crashes if an empty header value should be added.
  | mod_log_forensic:
  |  - new module.
  | mod_logio:
  |  - no longer removes the EOS bucket. PR 27928.
  | mod_proxy:
  |  - Fix handling of IPv6 numeric strings.
  | mod_rewrite:
  |   no longer turns forward proxy requests into reverse proxy
  |   requests. PR 28125
  | mod_ssl:
  |  - Log the errors returned on failure to load or initialize a
  |    crypto accelerator engine.
  |  - Fix a potential segfault in the 'shmcb' session cache for small
  |    cache sizes.  PR 27751.
  |  - Fix memory leak in session cache handling.  PR 26562
  |  - Fix potential segfaults when performing SSL shutdown from a pool
  |    cleanup.  PR 27945.
  | mod_auth_ldap/util_ldap:
  |  - allow relative paths for LDAPTrustedCA to be resolved against
  |    ServerRoot PR#26602
  |  - Throw an error message if an attempt is made to use the
  |    LDAPTrustedCA or LDAPTrustedCAType directives in a VirtualHost.
  |    PR 26390
  |  - Fix a potential segfault if the bind password in the LDAP cache
  |    is NULL.  PR 28250.
  |  - Overhaul handling of LDAP error conditions, so that the
  |    util_ldap_* functions leave the connections in a sane state
  |    after errors have occurred. PR 27748, 17274, 17599, 18661,
  |    21787, 24595, 24683, 27134, 27271
  |  - mod_ldap calls ldap_simple_bind_s() to validate the user
  |    credentials.  If the bind fails, the connection is left in an
  |    unbound state.  Make sure that the ldap connection record is
  |    updated to show that the connection is no longer bound.
  |  - Update the bind credentials for the cached LDAP connection to
  |    reflect the last bind.  This prevents util_ldap from creating
  |    unnecessary connections rather than reusing cached connections.
  |  - Quotes cannot be used around require group and require dn
  |    directives, update the documentation to reflect this. Also add
  |    quotes around the dn and group within debug messages, to make it
  |    more obvious why authentication is failing if quotes are used in
  |    error.  PR 19304.
  | miscellaneous:
  |  - Allow RequestHeader directives to be conditional. PR 27951.
  |  - Allow LimitRequestBody to be reset to unlimited. PR 29106
  |  - <VirtualHost myhost> now applies to all IP addresses for myhost
  |    instead of just the first one reported by the resolver.  This
  |    corrects a regression since 1.3.
  |  - Fix a bunch of cases where the return code of the regex compiler
  |    was not checked properly. This affects: mod_setenvif,
  |    mod_usertrack, mod_proxy, mod_proxy_ftp and core. PR 28218.
  |  - Remove 2Gb log file size restriction on some 32-bit platforms.
  |    PR 13511.
  |  - htpasswd no longer refuses to process files that contain empty
  |    lines.
  |  - Regression from 1.3: At startup, suexec now will be checked for
  |    availability, the setuid bit and user root. The works only if
  |    httpd is compiled with the shipped APR version (0.9.5).  PR
  |    28287.
  |  - Unix MPMs: Stop dropping connections when the file descriptor is
  |    at least FD_SETSIZE.
  |  - Fix a segfault when requests for shared memory fails and returns
  |    NULL. Fix a segfault caused by a lack of bounds checking on the
  |    cache.  PR 24801.
  |  - Ensure that lines in the request which are too long are properly
  |    terminated before logging.
  |  - htpasswd: use apr_temp_dir_get() and general cleanup
  |  - logresolve: Allow size of log line buffer to be overridden at
  |    build time (MAXLINE).  PR 27793.
  |  - Fix the comment delimiter in htdbm so that it correctly parses
  |    the username comment.  Also add a terminate function to allow
  |    NetWare to pause the output before the screen is destroyed.
  |  - Fix crash when Apache was started with no Listen directives.
  |  - core_output_filter: Fix bug that could result in sending garbage
  |    over the network when module handlers construct bucket brigades
  |    containing multiple file buckets all referencing the same open
  |    file descriptor.
  |  - Fix memory corruption problem with ap_custom_response()
  |    function.  The core per-dir config would later point to request
  |    pool data that would be reused for different purposes on
  |    different requests.

  |   Apache License, Version 2.0 (http://www.apache.org/licenses).
  |   [Apache Software Foundation]
  | Security [CAN-2004-0113 (cve.mitre.org)]: mod_ssl: Fix a memory
  |   leak in plain-HTTP-on-SSL-port handling.  PR 27106.
  | Security [CAN-2003-0020 (cve.mitre.org)]: Escape arbitrary data
  |   before writing into the errorlog. Unescaped errorlogs are still
  |   possible using the compile time switch
  |   "-DAP_UNSAFE_ERROR_LOG_UNESCAPED".
  | mod_ssl:
  |  - Send the Close Alert message to the peer before closing the
  |    SSL session.  PR 27428.
  |  - Fix bug in passphrase handling which could cause spurious
  |    failures in SSL functions later.  PR 21160.
  |  - Fix potential segfault on lookup of SSL_SESSION_ID.  PR 15057.
  |  - Fix streaming output from an nph- CGI script. PR 21944

  |  - Fix segfault on a non-SSL request if the 'c' log format code
  |    is used.  PR 22741.
  |  - Fix segfaults at startup if other modules which use OpenSSL
  |    are also loaded.
  |  - Use human-readable OpenSSL error strings in logs; use
  |    thread-safe interface for retrieving error strings.
  | mod_cache:
  |  - Fixed cache-removal order in mod_mem_cache.
  |  - Fix segfault in mod_mem_cache cache_insert() due to cache size
  |    becoming negative.  PR: 21285, 21287
  |  - Modified the cache code to be header-location agnostic. Also
  |    fixed a number of other cache code bugs related to PR 15852.
  |    Includes a patch submitted by Sushma Rai <rsushma novell.com>.
  |    This fixes mod_mem_cache but not mod_disk_cache yet so I'm not
  |    closing the PR since that is what they are using.
  | mod_dav:
  |  - Reject requests which include an unescaped fragment in the
  |    Request-URI.  PR 21779.
  |  - Use bucket brigades when reading PUT data. This avoids
  |    problems if the data stream is modified by an input filter. PR
  |    22104.
  |  - Return a WWW-auth header for MOVE/COPY requests where the
  |    destination resource gives a 401.  PR 15571.
  |  - Fix a problem with namespace mappings being dropped in
  |    mod_dav_fs; if any property values were set which defined
  |    namespaces these came out mangled in the PROPFIND response.
  |    PR 11637.
  | mod_expires:
  |  - Initialize ExpiresDefault to NULL instead of "" to avoid
  |    reporting an Internal Server error if it is used without
  |    having been set in the httpd.conf file. PR: 23748, 24459
  |  - Add support for IMT minor-type wildcards (e.g., text/*) to
  |    ExpiresByType.  PR#7991
  | mod_log_config / logging:
  |  - Fix some piped log problems: bogus "piped log program '(null)'
  |    failed" messages during restart and problem with the logger
  |    respawning again after Apache is stopped.  PR 21648, PR 24805.
  |  - mod_log_config: Fix corruption of buffered logs with threaded
  |    MPMs.  PR 25520.
  |  - mod_log_config: Log the minutes component of the timezone correctly.
  |    PR 23642.
  | mod_proxy*:
  |  - proxy_http fix: mod_proxy hangs when both KeepAlive and
  |    ProxyErrorOverride are enabled, and a non-200 response without a
  |    body is generated by the backend server. (e.g.: a client makes a
  |    request containing the "If-Modified-Since" and "If-None-Match"
  |    headers, to which the backend server respond with status 304.)
  |  - Fix memory leak in handling of request bodies during reverse
  |    proxy operations.  PR 24991.
  |  - mod_proxy: Fix cases where an invalid status-line could be sent
  |    to the client.  PR 23998.
  | mod_rewrite:
  |  - Catch an edge case, where strange subsequent RewriteRules
  |    could lead to a 400 (Bad Request) response.
  |  - Make REMOTE_PORT variable available in mod_rewrite.  PR 25772.
  |  - In external rewrite maps lookup keys containing
  |    a newline now cause a lookup failure. PR 14453.
  |  - Fix RewriteBase directive to not add double slashes.
  | mod_usertrack:
  |  - Fix bug in mod_usertrack when no CookieName is set.
  |  - mod_usertrack no longer inspects the Cookie2 header for
  |    the cookie name. PR 11475.
  |  - mod_usertrack no longer overwrites other cookies.
  |    PR 26002.
  | mod_include, filters:
  |  - Backport major overhaul of mod_include's filter parser from 2.1.
  |    The new parser code is expected to be more robust and should
  |    catch all of the edge cases that were not handled by the previous one.
  |    The 2.1 external API changes were hidden by a wrapper which is
  |    expected to keep the API backwards compatible.
  |  - Add a hook (insert_error_filter) to allow filters to re-insert
  |    themselves during processing of error responses. Enable mod_expires
  |    to use the new hook to include Expires headers in valid error
  |    responses. This addresses an RFC violation. It fixes PRs 19794,
  |    24884, and 25123.
  |  - complain via error_log when mod_include's INCLUDES filter is
  |    enabled, but the relevant Options flag allowing the filter to run
  |    for the specific resource wasn't set, so that the filter won't
  |    silently get skipped. next remove itself, so the warning will be
  |    logged only once
  |  - Fix mod_include's expression parser to recognize strings correctly
  |    even if they start with an escaped token.
  |  - Fix a problem with the display of empty variables ("SetEnv foo") in
  |    mod_include.  PR 24734
  |  - mod_include no longer allows an ETag header on 304 responses.
  |    PR 19355.
  | mod_autoindex:
  |  - Don't omit the <tr> start tag if the SuppressIcon option is

Thu Oct 30 11:41:19 CET 2003 - poeml@suse.de

- update to 2.0.48. Relevant / user visible changes are:
  Security [CAN-2003-0789]: Resolve some mishandling of the AF_UNIX
    socket used to communicate with the cgid daemon and the CGI
    script.
  Security [CAN-2003-0542]: Fix buffer overflows in mod_alias and
    mod_rewrite which occurred if one configured a regular
    expression with more than 9 captures.
  mod_rewrite:
    - Don't die silently when failing to open RewriteLogs. PR 23416
    - Fix support of the [P] option to send rewritten request using
      "proxy:". The code was adding multiple "proxy:" fields in the
      rewritten URI. PR: 13946.
    - Ignore RewriteRules in .htaccess files if the directory
      containing the .htaccess file is requested without a trailing
      slash.  PR 20195.
  mod_include:
    - Fix a trio of bugs that would cause various unusual sequences
      of parsed bytes to omit portions of the output stream. PR 21095
    - fix segfault which occured if the filename was not set, for
      example, when processing some error conditions.
  mod_cgid: fix a hash table corruption problem which could
    result in the wrong script being cleaned up at the end of a
    request.
  mod_ssl: Fix segfaults after renegotiation failure. PR 21370
    - Fix a problem setting variables that represent the client
      certificate chain.  PR 21371
    - Fix FakeBasicAuth for subrequest.  Log an error when an
      identity spoof is encountered.
    - Assure that we block properly when reading input bodies with
      SSL.  PR 19242.
  mod_autoindex: If a directory contains a file listed in the
    DirectoryIndex directive, the folder icon is no longer replaced
    by the icon of that file. PR 9587.
  mod_usertrack: do not get false positive matches on the
    user-tracking cookie's name. PR 16661.
  mod_cache:
    - Fix the cache code so that responses can be cached if they
      have an Expires header but no Etag or Last-Modified headers.
      PR 23130.  cache_util: Fix ap_check_cache_freshness to check
      max_age, smax_age, and expires as directed in RFC 2616.
  mod_deflate:
    - fix to not call deflate() without checking first whether it
      has something to deflate. (Currently this causes deflate to
      generate a fatal error according to the zlib spec.) PR 22259.
    - Don't attempt to hold all of the response until we're done.
    - Fix a bug, where mod_deflate sometimes unconditionally
      compressed the content if the Accept-Encoding header
      contained only other tokens than "gzip" (such as "deflate").
      PR 21523.
  mod_proxy: Don't respect the Server header field as set by
    modules and CGIs.  As with 1.3, for proxy requests any such
    field is from the origin server; otherwise it will have our
    server info as controlled by the ServerTokens directive.
  mod_log_config: Fix %b log format to write really "-" when 0
    bytes were sent (e.g. with 304 or 204 response codes).
  mod_ext_filter: Set additional environment variables for use by
    the external filter.  PR 20944.
  core:
    - allow <Foo>..</Foo> containers (no arguments in the opening
      tag), as in 1.3. Needed by mod_perl <Perl> sections
    - Fix a misleading message from the some of the threaded MPMs
      when MaxClients has to be lowered due to the setting of
      ServerLimit.
    - Avoid an infinite recursion, which occured if the name of an
      included config file or directory contained a wildcard
      character. PR 22194.
    - MPMs: The bucket brigades subsystem now honors the MaxMemFree
      setting.
    - Lower the severity of the "listener thread didn't exit"
      message to debug, as it is of interest only to developers.
  miscellaneous:
    - Update the header token parsing code to allow LWS between the
      token word and the ':' seperator.  [PR 16520]
    - Remember an authenticated user during internal redirects if
      the redirection target is not access protected and pass it to
      scripts using the REDIRECT_REMOTE_USER environment variable.
      PR 10678, 11602.
    - Update mime.types to include latest IANA and W3C types.
    - Modify ap_get_client_block() to note if it has seen EOS.
  ab:
    - Overlong credentials given via command line no longer clobber
      the buffer.
    - Work over non-loopback on Unix again. PR 21495.
    - Fix NULL-pointer issue in ab when parsing an incomplete or
      non-HTTP response. PR 21085.
- add another example to apache2-listen.conf

  (be clearer in describing the connection between AddType and
  AddEncoding for defining the meaning of compressed file
  extensions.)

- add mod_php4 to the default list of APACHE_MODULES, and change
  get_module_list to ignore non-existant modules (warnings will
  be issued when it is run from SuSEconfig, but not from the init
  script). How to enable the PHP4 module has been the most
  frequently asked questions in user feedback [cf to #29735].
  This bug is tracked in [#31306]
- include conf.d/*.conf by default, as it was the case until
  recently. User feedback showed that for many people the
  separation of configuration includes into individual virtual
  hosts is overkill, and it complicates the setup too much. More
  finegrained control can be achieved by commenting out the
  respective line in the default server config. [#30866], [#29735]
- remove the FIXME at the end of httpd.conf (obsoleted by the above
  change), and place a strategical comment there about .local files

    place them below /etc/apache2/sysconfig.d/. On update, convert
    the Include statements in httpd.conf for the new locations
  - add /etc/apache2/vhosts.d and virtual host templates
  - the configuration for the manual is now seperate and installed
    together with apache2-doc (conf.d/apache2-manual.conf)

- update to 2.0.47. relevant / user visible changes:
  Security [CAN-2003-0192]: Fixed a bug whereby certain sequences
    of per-directory renegotiations and the SSLCipherSuite
    directive being used to upgrade from a weak ciphersuite to a
    strong one could result in the weak ciphersuite being used in
    place of the strong one.
  Security [CAN-2003-0253]: Fixed a bug in prefork MPM causing
    temporary denial of service when accept() on a rarely accessed
    port returns certain errors.
  Security [CAN-2003-0254]: Fixed a bug in ftp proxy causing denial
    of service when target host is IPv6 but proxy server can't
    create IPv6 socket.  Fixed by the reporter.
  Security [VU#379828]: Prevent the server from crashing when entering
    infinite loops. The new LimitInternalRecursion directive
    configures limits of subsequent internal redirects and nested
    subrequests, after which the request will be aborted.  PR 19753+
  core:
    core_output_filter: don't split the brigade after a FLUSH
    bucket if it's the last bucket.  This prevents creating
    unneccessary empty brigades which may not be destroyed until
    the end of a keepalive connection.
  mod_cgid:
    Eliminate a double-close of a socket.  This resolves various
    operational problems in a threaded MPM, since on the second
    attempt to close the socket, the same descriptor was often
    already in use by another thread for another purpose.
  mod_negotiation:
    Introduce "prefer-language" environment variable, which allows
    to influence the negotiation process on request basis to prefer
    a certain language.
  mod_expire:
    Make ExpiresByType directive work properly, including for
    dynamically-generated documents.
- apr bugfixes

Wed May 28 20:40:24 CEST 2003 - poeml@suse.de

- update to 2.0.46. relevant / user visible changes:
  Security [CAN-2003-0245]: Fixed a bug that could be triggered
    remotely through mod_dav
  Security [CAN-2003-0189]: Fixed a denial-of-service
    vulnerability affecting basic authentication
  Security: forward port of buffer overflow fixes for htdigest.
  mod_ssl:
    - SSL session caching(shmht) : Fix a SEGV problem with SHMHT
      session caching.
  mod_deflate:
    - Add another check for already compressed content
    - Check also err_headers_out for an already set
      Content-Encoding: gzip header. This prevents gzip compressed
      content from a CGI script from being compressed once more.
  mod_mime_magic:
    - If mod_mime_magic does not know the content-type, do not
      attempt to guess.
  mod_rewrite:
    - Fix handling of absolute URIs.
  mod_log_config:
    - Add the ability to log the id of the thread processing the
      request via new %P formats.
  mod_auth_ldap:
    - Use generic whitespace character class when parsing "require"
      directives, instead of literal spaces only.
  mod_proxy:
    - Fixed a segfault when multiple ProxyBlock directives were used.
  - Added AllowEncodedSlashes directive to permit control of
    whether the server will accept encoded slashes ('%2f') in the
    URI path.  Default condition is off (the historical behaviour).
  - If Apache is started as root and you code CoreDumpDirectory,
    coredumps are enabled via the prctl() syscall.
  - htpasswd: Check the processed file on validity; add a delete flag.
- httpd-2.0.45-libtool-1.5.dif is obsolete
- mark suse_include.conf as %ghost
- note the rebirth of the httpd and apachectl man pages (thanks to
  RPMv4 :)
- let the module RPM packages only depend on the _major_ module
  magic number, not on the minor
- fix some paths in config_vars.mk, which facilitates building of
  certain modules

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 14 14:12:56 CEST 2003 - poeml@suse.de

- use mmap() via MAP_ANON as shared memory allocation method, to
  prevent restart problems with stale (or in use) files that are
  associated with shared memory
- package forgotten files, and remove hack in %clean

- update to 2.0.45. relevant / user visible changes:
  Security:  Eliminated leaks of several file descriptors to
    child processes, such as CGI scripts.  This fix depends on the
    latest APR library release 0.9.2, which is distributed with the
    httpd source tarball for Apache 2.0.45.  PR 17206
  Security [CAN-2003-0132]: Close a Denial of Service
    vulnerability identified by David Endler <DEndler@iDefense.com>
    on all platforms.
  General:
    - Fix segfault which occurred when a section in an included
      configuration file was not closed. PR 17093.
    - Fix a nasty segfault in mmap_bucket_setaside() caused by
      passing an incompatible pointer type to mmap_bucket_destroy(void*).
    - prevent filters (such as mod_deflate) from adding garbage to
      the response. PR 14451.
    - Simpler, faster code path for request header scanning
    - Try to log an error if a piped log program fails.  Try to
      restart a piped log program in more failure situations.
    - Fix bug where 'Satisfy Any' without an AuthType lost all MIME
      information (and more). Related to PR 9076.
    - Fix If header parsing when a non-mod_dav lock token is passed to it.
    - Fix apxs to insert LoadModule directives only outside of
      sections.
    - apxs: Include any special APR ld flags when linking the DSO.
  suexec: Be more pedantic when cleaning environment. Clean it
    immediately after startup. PR 2790, 10449. Use saner default
    config values for suexec. PR 15713.
  mod_cgi, mod_cgid, mod_ext_filter: Log errors when scripts cannot
    be started on Unix because of such problems as bad permissions,
    bad shebang line, etc. Fix possible segfaults under obscure
    error conditions within the cgid daemon.
  mod_deflate:
    - you can now specify the compression level.
    - Extend the DeflateFilterNote directive to allow accurate
      logging of the filter's in- and outstream.
    - Fix potential memory leaks in mod_deflate on malformed data.  PR 16046.
  mod_ssl:
    Allow SSLMutex to select/use the full range of APR locking
    mechanisms available to it. Also, fix the bug that SSLMutex
    uses APR_LOCK_DEFAULT no matter what.  PR 8122
  mod_autoindex no longer forgets output format and enabled version
    sort in linked column headers.
  mod_rewrite:
    - Prevent endless loops of internal redirects in mod_rewrite by
      aborting after exceeding a limit of internal redirects. The
      limit defaults to 10 and can be changed using the
      RewriteOptions directive. PR 17462.
    - Allow "RewriteEngine Off" even if no "Options FollowSymlinks"
      (or SymlinksIfOwnermatch) is set. PR 12395.
  mod_ldap:
    - Updated mod_ldap and mod_auth_ldap to support the Novell LDAP
      SDK SSL and standardized the LDAP SSL support across the
      various LDAP SDKs.  Isolated the SSL functionality to
      mod_ldap rather than speading it across mod_auth_ldap and
      mod_ldap.  Also added LDAPTrustedCA and LDAPTrustedCAType
      directives to mod_ldap to allow for a more common method of
      specifying the SSL certificate.
    - fix fault when caching was disabled, and some memory leaks
    - Fix mod_ldap to open an existing shared memory file should
      one already exist. PR 12757.
    - Added character set support to mod_auth_LDAP to allow it to
      convert extended characters used in the user ID to UTF-8
      before authenticating against the LDAP directory. The new
      directive AuthLDAPCharsetConfig is used to specify the config
      file that contains the character set conversion table.
  mod_ssl:
    - Fixed mod_ssl's SSLCertificateChain initialization to no
      longer skip the first cert of the chain by default.  This
      misbehavior was introduced in 2.0.34.  PR 14560
    - Fix 64-bit problem in mod_ssl input logic.
  mod_proxy:
    - Hook mod_proxy's fixup before mod_rewrite's fixup, so that by

      mod_proxy's fixup. PR 16368
    - Don't remove the Content-Length from responses in mod_proxy PR: 8677
  mod_auth_digest no longer tries to guess AuthDigestDomain, if it's
     not specified. Now it assumes "/" as already documented. PR 16937.
  mod_file_cache: fix segfaults
- improve the start/restart section of the init script, and add a
  ssl_scache_cleanup script

  file help text (bug noted in #25404]
- don't package the *.exp files, as they are needed only on AIX
- fix filelist for usage of %dir for files
- fix the cosmetical but irritating "Inappropriate ioctl for
  device" error message, when rcapache2 is called from within YaST
- remove the unused /etc/apache2/modules directory from the package
- remove the now unused --enable-experimental-libtool
- fix to build with libtool-1.5

- adjust some variable types in the sysconfig template

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb 18 11:39:18 CET 2003 - poeml@suse.de

- apache2 Makefiles do support DESTDIR now, so let's use that
  instead of the explicit paths (fixes a wrong path in
  config_vars.mk [#23699]).  Some files (*.exp, libapr*) are
  automatically installed in the right location now.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb 14 16:39:40 CET 2003 - poeml@suse.de

- fix configuration script to find apache modules on 64 bit archs
- mark ssl.conf (noreplace)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb 10 18:35:15 CET 2003 - poeml@suse.de

- add mod_ldap, mod_auth_ldap, but link only them against the LDAP
  libs. Likewise, do not link everything against ssl libs. This way
  we can avoid RPM package (and build) requirements on a lot of
  libs for subversion and other packages that build on apache.
- move more code from SuSEconfig into rcapache2 (actually into
  support scripts below /usr/share/apache2/, so apache2 can be
  configured without starting it)
- improve full-server-status once again
- remove suse_loadmodule.conf from filelist
- remove obsolete README.modules
- rename LOADMODULES -> APACHE_MODULES
- add APACHE_BUFFERED_LOGS
- update README.SuSE

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan 28 13:32:04 CET 2003 - poeml@suse.de

- rc.apache2
  - add extreme-configtest (trying to run server as nobody, which
    detects _all_ config errors)
  - evaluate LOADMODULES from sysconfig.apache2 on-the-fly from
    rcapache2 instead of SuSEconfig
  - when restarting, do something useful instead of 'sleep 3': wait
    just as long until the server has terminated all children

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jan 26 21:27:31 CET 2003 - poeml@suse.de

- build mod_logio, mod_case_filter, mod_case_filter_in

Wed Dec 18 15:11:53 CET 2002 - poeml@suse.de

- sysconfig.apache2:
  - add APACHE_SERVER_FLAGS variable
  - change default: APACHE_SERVERSIGNATURE=on to match apache deflt
  - add APACHE_CONF_INCLUDE_DIRS
  - drop bogus APACHE_ACCESS_SERVERINFO variable
  - adapt to our new sysconfig template
- SuSEconfig.apache2:
  - understand LOADMODULES also if it is not an array [#21816]
  - be very flexible with regard to LOADMODULE input (e.g., say
    mod_php4 and it will find libphp4.so with ID php4_module)
  - also ignore *,v files
  - include APACHE_CONF_INCLUDE_DIRS
  - dump some files: suse_define.conf (not needed) & suse_text.conf
    (too much overhead)
- rc.apache2:
  - implement most of apachectl's commands (graceful, configtest)
  - use server_flags from sysconfig.apache2
  - pass server flags like -DSTATUS from the command line through
    to httpd2
  - add commmands to show the server status
  - don't quit silently when no apache MPM is installed
  - handle ServerSignature and other stuff on the command line
    (save modifications to httpd.conf)
- fix the /manual Alias that points to the documentation
- configure /cgi-bin for cgi execution
- configure /home/*/public_html for mod_userdir -- if it is loaded
- configure internationalized error responses
- fix apachectl2
- add /etc/apache2/{,modules} to the filelist
- add /etc/apache2/conf.d as drop-in directory for packages
- hard code some more default paths into the executable
- finally, run a test!

  documentation
- move error, icons and manual dir to /usr/share/apache2
- fix nested array in SuSEconfig.apache2
- let SuSEconfig pick one MPM that is installed. Do not default to
  "worker". [#20724]

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct  3 14:50:20 CEST 2002 - poeml@suse.de

- update to 2.0.42 (primarily a bug-fix release, including updates
  to the experimental caching module, the removal of several memory
  leaks, and fixes for several segfaults, one of which could have
  been used as a denial-of-service against mod_dav (VU#406121).)
- increase flexibility of the spec file: build any set of MPMs,
  depending on RPM %defines. Improve the mechanism that merges the
  modules so it works with any number of MPMs.
- use a "Server:" header that fits the product apache is built for
- add an RPM dependency on the module magic number to the MPM
  subpackages
- build the "leader/follower" MPM. On i686, enable nonportable but
  faster atomics for it.
- use filelists for more flexibility. APRVARS ceased to exist.
  Don't add README* twice.
- perchild: use AcceptMutex fcntl to prevent permission conflict as
  suggested in Apache Bugzilla #7921
- remove mod_rewrite and mod_proxy from the default modules
- build the mod_auth_digest module

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep  9 15:30:34 CEST 2002 - poeml@suse.de

  header) from "Unix" to "SuSE/Linux" [#18543]
- add README.SuSE, explaining how to build modules with apxs2
- fixed some paths in README.modules, put it into docdir and mark
  it as %doc

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug 28 16:39:59 CEST 2002 - poeml@suse.de

- new package, now building all three MPMs and putting all specific
  modules in specific directories. Branch a subpackage for each
  MPM, containing the server and MPM-specific modules.
- branch apr package off, so apache2 doesn't need to be installed
  to have the libs. (apr is not released yet, that's why we build
  it here)
- allow coexistence of apache1 by using directories named apache2
  or suffixed with "2"
- allow building modules via apxs2 (for all server MPMs) --- or via
  apxs2-{worker,perchild,prefork} for a specific server MPM
- add permissions.apache2 setting /usr/sbin/suexec2 to 4755
- rewrite SuSEconfig.apache2 for apache 2.
- add httpd-2.0.40-cache_util.c.diff that prevents a segfault in
  mod_proxy when given an invalid URL
- branch apache2-example-pages off (docroot contents)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 19 16:43:37 CEST 2002 - poeml@suse.de

  apache2-devel -> apache2-{worker,perchild,prefork}-devel

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 12 17:47:08 CEST 2002 - poeml@suse.de

- bugfix update to 2.0.40
- fix Requires of -devel subpackage
- add variable to sysconfig.apache to switch off SuSEconfig.apache
- add new layout SUSE81 to config.layout due to the moved server
  root (so the old SuSE6.1 can be kept for building on older
  distributions)
- one of the lib64 path fixes could be removed, now included
  upstream

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug  7 18:47:33 CEST 2002 - poeml@suse.de

- put PreReq in an if-statement to allow building on older distris
- relax the Requires
- the apache_mmn macro had to be moved down in the spec file to be
  evaluated
- libmm is not needed for building (and it is not threadsafe)
