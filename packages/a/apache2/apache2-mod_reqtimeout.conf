# Set timeout and minimum data rate for receiving requests to limit
# the effects of denial of service attacks that connect, but let the
# server wait for the completion of the request, thereby allocating
# resources. The most commonly name for this attack method is
# slowloris.

# mod_reqtimeout.c must be loaded.

#
# Note:
# the RequestReadTimeout directive can also be placed into a
# virtual host context.
#
# Play around with variations of the below values if you are
# under attack from slowloris or a similar tool.

<IfModule mod_reqtimeout.c>
  # allow 10s timeout for the headers and allow 1s more until 20s upon
  # receipt of 1000 bytes.
  # almost the same with the body, except that it is tricky to
  # limit the request timeout within the body at all - it may take
  # time to generate the body.
