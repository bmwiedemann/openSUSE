  <title>Accessibility debugging tool</title>
  <description>Accerciser is an interactive Python accessibility explorer for the
GNOME desktop. It uses AT-SPI to inspect and control widgets, allowing
you to check if an application is providing correct information to
assistive technologies and automated test frameworks. Accerciser has a
simple plugin framework which you can use to create custom views of
accessibility information.

In essence, Accerciser is a next generation at-poke tool.</description>
