%description
Antimicrox is a graphical program used to map keyboard keys and mouse
controls to a gamepad. This program is useful for playing PC games using
a gamepad that do not have any form of built-in gamepad support.
However, you can use this program to control any desktop application with
a gamepad; on Linux, this means that your system has to be running an
X environment in order to run this program.

This application is continuation of project called AntiMicro,
which was later abandoned and revived by juliagoda.
