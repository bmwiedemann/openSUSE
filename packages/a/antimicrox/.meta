  <description>antimicrox is a graphical program used to map keyboard keys and mouse controls to a gamepad. This program is useful for playing PC games using a gamepad that do not have any form of built-in gamepad support. However, you can use this program to control any desktop application with a gamepad; on Linux, this means that your system has to be running an X environment in order to run this program.

This program is currently supported under various Linux distributions.

This application is continuation of project called AntiMicro, which was later abandoned and revived by juliagoda.</description>
