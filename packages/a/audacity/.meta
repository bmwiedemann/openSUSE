  <title>A Free, Cross-Platform Digital Audio Editor</title>
  <description>Audacity is a program that manipulates digital audio wave forms. In
addition to recording sounds directly from within the program, it
imports many sound file formats, including WAV, AIFF, AU, IRCAM, MP,
and Ogg Vorbis.  With Audacity, you can edit wave data larger than the
physical memory size of your computer.</description>
