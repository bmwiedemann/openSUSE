To clarify this licensing here is the response from David:

"The copyright notices in the source code are intended to suggest that 
non-commercial users need not contact me for permission. It is granted
in the source code comments. Originally, commercial users needed 
a license and in some cases paid a fee. Now, commercial use is governed 
by a BSD-like license as you've mentioned. I guess I should at least 
update my copies of the source files to say that but I have no control 
over what is floating around the net.
