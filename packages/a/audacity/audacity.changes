    which apply to the entire project at once. More information can
    be found at Using master effects & realtime effects.

  * New compressor and limiter
  - A new compressor and limiter has been added, replacing the 
    previous versions. A gain reduction history has been added to
    these effects when they're used as a realtime effect.

    effects have been provided by Vladislav Isaev and Marek Iwaszkiewicz,
    available via the Presets & Settings button.

  * New themes
  - Audacity now features new and improved dark and light themes.
    You can switch between themes via Preferences -> Interface.
  - The theme previously used still is around as the Classic theme,
    and themes even older than that can be optionally installed as
    custom themes[1] from here[2].
    Updated instructions on creating custom themes can be found here[3].
    [1]https://support.audacityteam.org/basics/customizing-audacity/using-themes#installing-custom-themes
    [2]https://github.com/LWinterberg/classicTheme
    [3]https://audacity.gitbook.io/dev/scripting/creating-custom-themes

  * Increased performance
  - Audacity is now quite a bit snappier than before, especially when
    working on larger projects and on larger screens.

Other changes

  * Added FFmpeg 7 support.
  * You now can paste audio files into Audacity using Ctrl+V.
  * Alternative waveform colors are now themeable by custom themes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr 30 05:53:46 UTC 2024 - Konstantin Voinov <kv@kott.no-ip.biz>

- Update VST3SDK to latest 3.7.11_build10
- Remove vst3sdk-fix-include-cstdint-for-gcc13.patch and
         vst3sdk-fix-limits-include-moduleinfoparser.patch
- Update to 3.5.1
  This is a hotfix release. It fixes the following bugs:
  * #6322 Fixed a crash on launch on macOS 11 and older.
  * #6324 Fixed the update notification looking for alpha versions
    instead of release versions.
  * #6321 Fixed a freeze when using macros on multiple files.

- Version 3.5.0 changes:

  Major changes

  * Cloud project saving
  * We've introduced a new cloud-saving feature that allows you to
    save your Audacity projects to audio.com. This allows you to work
    from any device, share & collaborate with others and restore
    previous versions if something went wrong.
  * Automatic tempo detection
  * Audacity can now automatically detect the tempo of imported loops,
    and adjust them to be in tempo.
  * Tempo detection is done via both audio analysis and metadata checking.
    If you want to prepare your loop for automatic tempo detection
    without relying on audio analysis, both acidizer tempo tags or
    simply writing "123 bpm" anywhere into the filename work.
  * Automatic tempo detection can be turned off via Preferences -> Import/Export.
  * Pitch shifting
  * You now can non-destructively change the pitch of a clip by
    holding Alt and pressing the Up and Down arrow keys. Alternatively,
    you can click on the overflow menu (...) and select "Pitch and speed...".
    When changing the pitch this way, an arrow in the UI indicates
    how much you've shifted it.

  Other changes
  Additions

  * Added an option to skip plugin scanning to Preferences -> Effects.
  * Added an overflow menu, as well as speed and pitch indicators to clips.
  * Added subtitle formats for labels. Export to WebVTT and SubRip and
    import of SubRip files is now supported. (Thanks, Pokechu22 and
    Larry Bordowitz!)

  Changes

  * Reworked the plugin manager.
  * Improved accessibility. (Thanks, David Bailes!)
  * When zooming in vertically (Ctrl+scroll on the vertical
    scale), the zeroline now remains centered. Moving the vertical
    zoom off-center still is possible via Shift+scroll on the vertical scale.
  * Changed the look of the selection adjust cursors (previously pointing
    fingers on Windows and macOS, now look like >| everywhere).
  * Changed the timeline options button from a green triangle to
    a settings gear. From it, you can switch between Beats & Measures
    or hh:mm:ss timeline rulers, set various preferences regarding to looping,
    as well as playhead behaviors: "Scroll view to playhead"
    (previously: "Update display while playing") and "Continuous scrolling"
    (previously: Pinned Play Head).
  * Improved BSD support. (Thanks, Brad Smith!)
  * macOS: Changed the Audacity.app icon on macOS to fit new design guidelines.
  * Reordered some menus.
  * Moved OK/Cancel buttons of effects to the bottom.

  Removals

  There have been a number of removals of niche features to simplify the app.
  This should make the app a bit less overwhelming to use, and
  also will speed up future development as fewer things need to be considered.

  * Removed the read-only mouse preferences page.
  * Removed Printing options.
  * Removed Screenshot tool. To make a screenshot,
    use Win+Shift+S (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+4 (Mac) instead.
  * Removed Karaoke view.
  * Removed the "solo=none" preference.
  * Removed timeline tooltips preference.
  * Removed "dragging selection edges" preference.
  * Removed some warning dialogs and associated preferences.
  * Removed "scrolling left of zero" preference.
  * Replaced "Advanced Vertical Zooming" with new always-on behavior.
  * Removed some vertical zoom presets.
  * Removed EQ XML to TXT converter, which was needed for 
    the Audacity 2.3 -> 2.4 transition. It is now a plugin instead,
    downloadable at https://plugins.audacityteam.org/additional-resources/eq-curves/eq-xml-to-txt-converter.
  * Removed the "Vocal reduction and isolation" effect. As a replacement
    on Windows and Linux, the Intel OpenVINO plugins work better and on
    a wider array of content, including mono tracks. The old effect still can
    be downloaded from https://plugins.audacityteam.org/nyquist-plugins/effect-plugins/filters-and-eq#vocal-reduction-and-isolation

  Bugfixes

  * Fixed a number of dialogs that were able to grow too large to
    fit on the screen.

    actual playback. (Thanks, David Bailes!)

  * #5283 Fixed "Reset configuration" command breaking modules preference page.
  * #5389 Fixed stereo tracks randomly splitting into mono.

    audio. (Thanks, David Bailes!)
  * #5580 #4952 Fixed Timer Record sometimes failing to export.
    (Thanks, David Bailes!)
  * #5681 Fixed incorrect level measurements for mono tracks in
    Noise Gate effect. (Thanks, Steve Daulton!)
  * #5750 When exporting multiple files, the mono/stereo setting is
    now honored properly.
  * #5848 Fixed some effects failing when language is set to German,
    Korean, Dutch, Slovenian, or Turkish.
  * #5868 #1548 Fixed 8 and 9 inputs not working on keyboard inputs which
    have AltGr+8/9 mean [ and ]. (Thanks, David Bailes!)
  * #5858 Fixed Audacity crashing when making a stereo track using
    keyboard. (Thanks, Joe Souza!)
  * #5976 Fixed the "Set default" button not working in the metadata
    editor. (Thanks, dg-no-9!)
  * #5977 Linux: Fixed a memory leak in Wayland by explicitly running
    on X11. (Thanks, Takahashi, Naoki!)

Changes in version 3.2.1

 This is a patch release. It fixes some bugs and has minor improvements.

    * #3694 Fixed a crash when applying Waves Berzerk Distortion 
      Mono to a mono track
    * #3699 Fixed a freeze when very quickly starting and stopping
      playback.
    * #3747 macOS: Homebrew FFmpeg installs are now found automatically
    * #3594 macOS: Fixed Melda VST Plugin UI
    * #3474 Building with VST3 support is now possible without Conan.

Changes in version 3.2.0

 This version adds realtime effects and VST3. 

 Prominent changes
    * Added a new Effects button to the tracks menu, allowing you to
      place realtime effects. 
       Further information can be found can be found on 
       https://support.audacityteam.org/audio-editing/using-realtime-effects
    * Merged the mixer bar with the meter bars.
    * Added a new Audio Setup button, replacing the Device Toolbar
      by default. The device toolbar can be re-added via the
      View > Toolbars menu.
    * The Effects menu has gotten a new sorting. Other sorting and
      grouping options can be found in the Effects preferences.
    * Updated the icons.
    * Added a quick audio sharing feature.
       More info can be found on https://support.audacityteam.org/basics/sharing-audio-online

 Plugin changes
    You can find plugins on https://plugins.audacityteam.org
    * VST3 effects are now supported.
    * The following plugin formats are now realtime capable: 
      VST3, LV2, LADSPA, Audio Units.
    * Plugins now automatically get scanned, tested and enabled
      when Audacity starts.
 
 System changes
    * Apple Silicon (arm64) is now supported on macOS
       Note: When using an arm64 Audacity, you must use arm64
       versions of FFMPEG and plugins. Plugins for x86-64 (Intel macs) will not load.
       For the time being, Audacity will continue to download 
       x86-64 versions by default to avoid these incompatibilities, 
       but you can download an arm64 version from Github releases:
       https://github.com/audacity/audacity/releases
    * FFMPEG 5.0 (avformat 59) is now supported, in addition to
      avformat 55, 57 and 58
    * Added support for Wavpack
    * On Linux, Audacity can now be compiled without JACK present.
    * Audacity now uses XDG directories on Linux. 
       Note: If you are upgrading from a previous version,
       Audacity will keep using the ~/.audacity-data and ~/.audacity folders until you delete them.
    * Switched from mad to mpg123 as MP3 importer
 
 License update
    * Audacity binaries are now licensed under the 
      GNU General Public License, Version 3. 
      Most code files remain GPLv2-or-later, but VST3 
      support required this license update. 
      More information can be found in the announcement 
      post: https://github.com/audacity/audacity/discussions/2142
 
 Removals
    * Removed the Zoom Tool. You can use the zoom buttons
      or Ctrl+Scroll (macOS: Cmd+Scroll) to zoom instead.
    * The Audacity Manual HTML pages are no longer included 
      in the installation.
       If you require offline access of the manual, you can download
       it here: https://github.com/audacity/audacity-manual/releases
       You also can download PDFs of https://support.audacityteam.org
       straight from its sidebar (or the three-dot button on mobile devices).


 Fixed bugs:
   * #3079 Fixed Audacity sometimes not being able to import MP3 
     files (or reporting Huffman Data Overruns)
   * #2590 Fixed rare data loss bug when placing labels during recording
   * #2272 Fixed clip titles being able to disappear off-screen when editing them
   * #2162 Fixed Punch and Roll not paying tracks in sync
   * #1889 Fixed clip titles changing name when applying some effects
   * #1624 During batch processing, Audacity will no longer stop to ask 
     for a sample rate when an unsupported one is chosen, but choose the
     nearest supported one instead.
   * #2265 Fixed mod-script-pipe not being installed on Linux 
   * #3571 Fixed GTK packaging in Appimages. This fixes various issues with
     icons, dropdowns and similar things not appearing properly.
   * #3634 Improved M4A/AAC support. Previously the target bitrate was 
     not honored at all, now it can be set between 98 and 160 kbit/s (mono)
     or 196 and 320 kbit/s (stereo). The UI does not yet reflect these limits.

- Update to release 3.0.0 and add patch for wxWidgets test:
  audacity-remove-wx-test.patch
- Add another useless return after assert to:
  audacity-no_return_in_nonvoid.patch
- Upstream changes:
 *Audacity 3.0.0 is a major update on our previous release
  Weâve changed the format in which we save Audacity projects! 
  Previously we saved projects as a sometimes large number of small
  files, with an â.aupâ file to coordinate the lot. This way of
  doing things is sometimes called âpile of filesâ storage.
 *We did have time to improve our âNoise Gateâ effect and add a
  new analyzer, âLabel Soundsâ, that can label sounds and silences
  We also made a few small tweaks elsewhere. You can now import
  and export macros, and there are a couple of new commands for
  using the last used tool or last used analyzer that you can give
  shortcuts to.
 *We also fixed over 160 bugs that had been accumulating over the
  years. This is quite a staggering amount of work. The majority
  of these bugs were minor problems, easily worked around.
  Some though were really juicy high priority bugs that would have
  mattered a lot to the people affected by them. Weâre really glad
  to have these bugs fixed now.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 15 08:11:19 UTC 2018 - davejplater@gmail.com

- Update to maintenance release version 2.2.1
- Upstream changes and fixes:
  *Waveform colorways:
   You can optionally change the colorway of the waveforms
   displayed in your project. The setting is per track and not per
   project so you can have multiple colorways in the same project. 
  *"Save Other" reverts to "Export" in the File menu:
   When we made the menu changes for 2.2.0 we introduced an entry
   into the File menu called "Save Other" which led to a sub-menu
   for exporting various audio formats.
   Many users were confused by this change and found it hard to
   find where they could export.
  *Bug #1770 - Crash applying certain chain files
  *Bug #1783 - Preview fails when selection extends before zero
  *Bug #1787 - Auto-scroll stopped working in 2.2.0
  *Bug #1765 - Using File > Open to import audio gives wrong zoom
   level and no scroll bar slider.

    + Menus Reorganized
    + Extended menu bar provided
    + New keyboard commands for working with clips

    is now available.
  * 'Center' option in Selection Toolbar
  * Stem plots
  * Major overhaul to documentation/manual including many new
    images and streamlined text on landing pages for in-program
    help.
  Other Changes:
  * Append-record is now the default (use Shift + Record for old
    behavior, to record on a new track)
  * The Esc key now cancels all click-and-drag actions. It also
    chooses among overlapping mouse click targets, which is
    especially useful in the Multi-Tool.
  * Sync-Lock button removed (use menu item or keyboard shortcut
    instead)
  * New preferences and preference pages
  * Overhaul of much code:
    + Overhaul of envelope handling code to deal with some
      anomalies
    + Overhaul of exception handling for greater safety
  * New Logo
  Bug Fixes:
  * Major work on bug fixing. 198 bugs that were in 2.1.3 fixed
    for 2.2.0.
    + The most serious bug fixed this time round was bug 437 which
      was about what happens when Audacity is recording and runs
      out of storage.
    + The problems of incomplete support for macOs Sierra have
      been resolved (including bug 290, bug 1567, bug 1702, and bug
      1703).
    + Most of the bugs fixed were more minor, such as bug 463
      which was about a case in which the numbering on the timeline
      could display incorrect times.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 30 23:21:32 UTC 2015 - sor.alexei@meowr.ru

- Update to 2.1.0:
  + Changes and Improvements:
    * LADSPA and VST effects now support real-time preview,
      save/load of user presets and saving effect settings across
      sessions. Note: Real-time preview does not yet support
      latency compensation.
    * VST effects now support import/export of FXB preset banks.

    * Items in the Effect, Generate or Analyze Menus can be sorted
      or grouped by name, publisher or class of effect.
    * Noise Removal is improved and renamed to "Noise Reduction".
    * Change Speed has new time controls for current and new length.
      You can now enter the speed change as a multiplier e.g. "2" is
      twice as fast. 
    * New "Crossfade Tracks" effect can be used for crossfading two
      tracks. This replaces Cross Fade In and Cross Fade Out.
    * Nyquist Prompt and most shipped Nyquist effects now have
      Preview button. 
    * Redesigned Meter Toolbars: The default shows separate Record
      and Playback Meters, half-height so they can be wider while
      docked, in gradient style.
    * A frequency selection can now be made (and spectral edit
      effects applied to those frequencies) when in a spectrogram
      view. You can also create or adjust frequency selections in a
      new "Spectral Selection Toolbar" (available at View > Toolbars).
    * Transcription Toolbar (Play-at-speed) can now loop play and
      cut-preview. 
    * Timer Record now saves recordings automatically into an
      existing project.

   * Spectrogram log (f) view displayed incorrectly until
     vertically zoomed.
   * Fixed crash after zooming out on vertical scale beyond +/-1.0.
   * Selections made with Selection Toolbar were not restored after
     Undo.
   * Undo could fail silently if a selection included/touched a
     clip boundary.

     prevented Audacity recognising the installed FFmpeg or the
     FFmpeg specified in audacity.cfg.
   * Fix "Audacity already running" error when using the
     command-line or context menu to open multiple or further files.
   * Fix segfault exporting an FFmpeg format to an unwritable folder.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct 24 22:38:46 UTC 2014 - joerg.lorenzen@ki.tng.de

- Update to 2.0.6:
  Bug fixes for:
   * Interface:
     * Region Restore did not restore the region after using Preferences. 
     * Dragging selections with the keyboard or Selection Toolbar digits 
       was very slow.  
     * (Windows) Help > About Audacity crashed when run in Magyar language.  
     * (OS X) Some full and reduced Menu Bar items were not translated.  
     * (OS X and Linux) Fixed various interface crashes.

     * Reverb and Paulstretch were missing from Chains.
     * Analyze > Contrast could report very inaccurate rms levels.
     * Noise Removal: Attack and decay times were half as long as set.  
     * (OS X and Linux) Nyquist effects ran much more slowly than on Windows. 
   * Click or drag on the Timeline after Loop Play continued to loop.
   * Transcription Toolbar did not play slower than 0.1x speed.
   * (Linux) Audacity did not build if python 2 was not available.  
  Changes and Improvements:
   * Interface:
     * Redesigned, searchable Keyboard Preferences with Tree, Name and Key views.  
     * Edit Menu: "Cut" and "Delete" are now in the top level of the menu.

     * New right-click menu choice "Delete Label" to remove single labels.
     * "Snap To" now offers choice of snap to the "closest" or "prior" position.
       Note: the previous "Snap To On" keyboard shortcut will no longer work.   
     * "Snap To" settings are now independent for each project.
   * Effects:
     * Truncate Silence: redesigned with simpler option "Truncate Detected 
       Silence" to shorten to the specified length without compressing silence.
     * VST effects: New "Settings" dialog lets you specify buffer size (for 
       faster processing) and enable buffer delay compensation (to prevent
       inserted silence). Compensation may cause a crash in a few plug-ins. 
     * VST effects now support standard FXP presets.  
     * LV2 effects are now supported on all platforms (textual interface only).    

   * Import or export using FFmpeg now requires FFmpeg 1.2 or later (or libav
     0.8 or later). For recommended downloads of recent FFmpeg please visit:
     http://manual.audacityteam.org/o/man/faq_installation_and_plug_ins.html#ffdown .
   * New Tamil translation (largely complete). 
   * (Windows) FLAC exports can now exceed 2 GB in size. 
   * (OS X) Easier Audacity installation using the DMG: drag the Audacity folder
     to the /Applications shortcut, 
   * (OS X) Audacity 2.0.6 will not officially support OS X 10.10 Yosemite when 
     released (in particular, Apple Audio Units may not open in Audacity).
   * (Linux) Self-compiled builds of Audacity now search for system LADSPA 
     effects in /usr/lib/ladspa.
 -  Added patch audacity-flac_assert.h.patch to build against flac 1.3.0.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 29 09:25:00 UTC 2013 - kkaempf@suse.com

- Update to version 2.0.3
  Bug fixes
  * General
    - Crash using Undo whilst time-shifting a track.
    - Crash using Repair if the selection extended into an empty track.
    - Export Multiple didn't prevent export if there was no audio or all
      audio was muted. This allowed export of small invalid files.
  * Time Track
    - Loop Play of a speeded-up track inserted silence.
    - Playback and rendering was significantly inaccurate, creating audible
      and visual glitches.
  * Accessibility
    - The mnemonics character "&" was read out by screen readers in most of
       the Preferences choices.
    - NVDA did not read static text in most dialogs. Text can now be read by
      using INSERT + B.
    - JAWS and Window-eyes misread the "Duration" control in Silence
      Generator.
    - Toolbar buttons could not be pressed by ENTER
    - Other interface bug fixes.
  Changes and Improvements
  * Resampling
    - The SoX Resampler library (libsoxr) has replaced libresample in
      Audacity releases, offering both higher quality and greater speed.
  * Time Tracks new features
    - "Set Range" now changes only the range of the Time Track, preserving
      the pitch/speed set by any existing warp points.
    - Vertical scale added with options for linear and logarithmic display
      and interpolation.
    - Upper and lower speed limits will now be remembered when saving and
      reopening a project in 2.0.3. Warp points in projects saved by
      previous Audacity versions will be correctly restored in 2.0.3.
    - Warp points saved in a 2.0.3 project will be preserved if opened in
      previous versions but playback and display will be incorrect.
  * New effects
    - Studio Fade Out (uses a filtered "S" curve).
    - Adjustable Fade (accessible effect for creating partial fades and
      adjustable fade shapes).
    - Bass and Treble (replaces Bass Boost).
  * General
    - Real sample rates up to 384000 Hz are now supported for playback and
      recording in high resolution devices (the maximum is up to 192000 Hz
      for Windows DirectSound host).
    - Labeled Regions in Edit Menu is renamed to "Labeled Audio" and now
      allows splits to be placed at point labels. Labeled audio regions that
      touch without overlapping are treated as separate regions. Overlapping
      labeled audio regions are treated as a single region.
    - New Croatian translation of Audacity.
  * Compilation
    - CMake is required in order to build libsoxr.

- removed audacity-implicit.patch and audacity-2.0.2-docdir.patch
  both included in 2.0.3

- explicitly disable SSE on non-x86 architectures (fixes ARM,
  probably others)

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- Recommend libmp3lame0, libavformat52, libavcodec52 and libavutil50

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 14 15:06:03 UTC 2012 - reddwarf@opensuse.org

- Update to version 2.0.0

  * Bug fixes for:

   - Interface:
     - Fixed playback speed and synchronization problems when dragging
       clips or tracks between tracks having different sample rates.

     - Imports and Exports:
       - Fixed crashes when changing the sample format of read-directly WAV
         or AIFF files using the Track Drop-Down Menu.
       - Fixed a crash importing MP3 files that had duplicate metadata tags
         (this is a bug in current libsndfile which has been patched in
         Audacity; MP3 files mislabeled as WAV which have duplicate tags
         will still crash Audacity on Linux if Audacity has been compiled
         against an affected version of system libsndfile).
     - Fixed an issue where excessively high or corrupted sample values in
       the audio could corrupt exports from the start of the problem for
       the rest of the file, and could corrupt the rest of the project.
    - Fixed Audacity could not be compiled against FFmpeg
      0.7.x and 0.8.x.

   - Effects and Analysis:
     - Fixed crash on launch when using "Ambisonic Decoders (PC)" VST
       plug-ins and other plug-ins that enable additional floating point
       exceptions.
     - Fixed Plot Spectrum background could be transparent on some machines.
     - Bug fixes for Click Track, High Pass, Low Pass and Vocal Remover.
     - Chirp, Tone and Silence generators now remember their settings.

   - Other miscellaneous bug fixes.

  * Changes and Improvements:

   - New Interface preference to show the track name in the display (this
     is off by default).
   - Longer default Playback preference for effects preview and preview
     before cut.
   - Restored use of Page Up and Page Down to scroll horizontally.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec 20 00:00:00 CET 2011 - detlef@links2linux.de

- Update to version 1.3.14

  * Bug fixes for:

   - Interface:
     - Excessive delay occurred when typing into labels in long projects. 
     - Last digit of TimeText controls could not be manipulated in some formats.
     - (Windows, OS X) Play and Record shortcuts did not work after clicking in
       Device Toolbar. 
     - (OS X, Linux) Crash occurred if Toolbars were reset during playback or
       recording. 
   - Imports and Exports:
     - MP2 files were not importable without FFmpeg library or an import rule. 
     - Files that could only be imported using FFmpeg imported as noise with
       no error message if FFmpeg was not available. 
     - Files containing PCM audio but an incorrect extension (such as MP3) 
       caused a freeze. 
   - Effects and Analysis:
     - An empty command could be added to a Chain which then displayed a 
       Nyquist error message when run.  
     - Plot Spectrum didn't preserve signal level if multiple tracks were 
       analyzed.  
   - Other bug fixes:
     - Audacity has been provisionally fixed so that it can no longer create 
       block files longer than the sample format or project format allows, 
       and can no longer delete these, which led to data loss. Any overlong 
       blocks found are preserved but "orphaned", so will appear as silence.
     - Orphan block files were wrongly reported if cutting or copying to 
       the clipboard then reopening the project in the same session. 
     - Fixed some crashes and incorrect movement of audio when dragging tracks.
     - (Windows) Data loss is now prevented when encountering a corrupted
       .aup file created in ANSI builds. 
     - (Linux) Restore building if USE_PORTMIXER is not defined. 
 
  * Changes and Improvements:

   - Normalize: Faster processing and improved interface. Left-right balance 
     in unsplit stereo tracks is now preserved by default, with a checkbox 
     option provided to process stereo channels independently.   
   - Spectrograms now allow window sizes up to 32768 and frequencies up to
     half the sample rate (the maximum possible).
   - Mix and Render now preserves clip length by not rendering white space 
     between time zero and first audio, and preserves audio before time zero.
     To retain silence before the audio starts, generate silence after render.     
   - Grouped some Edit Menu items into "Remove Audio" and "Clip Boundaries".  
   - CleanSpeech Mode removed from Interface Preferences (it still runs if it
     was enabled in a previous Audacity but can only be turned off there). 
   - (OS X) Added support for AudioUnit MusicEffects (but no MIDI support). 
   - (Linux) Set the per-user files directory per the program name set in 
     configure.
   - (Linux) Changed the default location of the Audacity temporary directory
     to be in /var/tmp not /tmp, so preserving the directory between reboots.
