Changes in version 3.2.1

 This is a patch release. It fixes some bugs and has minor improvements.

    * #3694 Fixed a crash when applying Waves Berzerk Distortion 
      Mono to a mono track
    * #3699 Fixed a freeze when very quickly starting and stopping

    * #3594 macOS: Fixed Melda VST Plugin UI
    * #3474 Building with VST3 support is now possible without Conan.

Changes in version 3.2.0

 This version adds realtime effects and VST3. 

 Prominent changes
    * Added a new Effects button to the tracks menu, allowing you to
      place realtime effects. 
       Further information can be found can be found on 
       https://support.audacityteam.org/audio-editing/using-realtime-effects
    * Merged the mixer bar with the meter bars.
    * Added a new Audio Setup button, replacing the Device Toolbar
      by default. The device toolbar can be re-added via the
      View > Toolbars menu.
    * The Effects menu has gotten a new sorting. Other sorting and
      grouping options can be found in the Effects preferences.
    * Updated the icons.
    * Added a quick audio sharing feature.
       More info can be found on https://support.audacityteam.org/basics/sharing-audio-online

 Plugin changes
    You can find plugins on https://plugins.audacityteam.org
    * VST3 effects are now supported.
    * The following plugin formats are now realtime capable: 
      VST3, LV2, LADSPA, Audio Units.
    * Plugins now automatically get scanned, tested and enabled
      when Audacity starts.
 
 System changes
    * Apple Silicon (arm64) is now supported on macOS
       Note: When using an arm64 Audacity, you must use arm64
       versions of FFMPEG and plugins. Plugins for x86-64 (Intel macs) will not load.
       For the time being, Audacity will continue to download 
       x86-64 versions by default to avoid these incompatibilities, 
       but you can download an arm64 version from Github releases:
       https://github.com/audacity/audacity/releases
    * FFMPEG 5.0 (avformat 59) is now supported, in addition to
      avformat 55, 57 and 58
    * Added support for Wavpack
    * On Linux, Audacity can now be compiled without JACK present.
    * Audacity now uses XDG directories on Linux. 
       Note: If you are upgrading from a previous version,
       Audacity will keep using the ~/.audacity-data and ~/.audacity folders until you delete them.
    * Switched from mad to mpg123 as MP3 importer
 
 License update
    * Audacity binaries are now licensed under the 
      GNU General Public License, Version 3. 
      Most code files remain GPLv2-or-later, but VST3 
      support required this license update. 
      More information can be found in the announcement 
      post: https://github.com/audacity/audacity/discussions/2142
 
 Removals
    * Removed the Zoom Tool. You can use the zoom buttons
      or Ctrl+Scroll (macOS: Cmd+Scroll) to zoom instead.
    * The Audacity Manual HTML pages are no longer included 
      in the installation.
       If you require offline access of the manual, you can download
       it here: https://github.com/audacity/audacity-manual/releases
       You also can download PDFs of https://support.audacityteam.org
       straight from its sidebar (or the three-dot button on mobile devices).


 Fixed bugs:
   * #3079 Fixed Audacity sometimes not being able to import MP3 
     files (or reporting Huffman Data Overruns)
   * #2590 Fixed rare data loss bug when placing labels during recording
   * #2272 Fixed clip titles being able to disappear off-screen when editing them
   * #2162 Fixed Punch and Roll not paying tracks in sync
   * #1889 Fixed clip titles changing name when applying some effects
   * #1624 During batch processing, Audacity will no longer stop to ask 
     for a sample rate when an unsupported one is chosen, but choose the
     nearest supported one instead.
   * #2265 Fixed mod-script-pipe not being installed on Linux 
   * #3571 Fixed GTK packaging in Appimages. This fixes various issues with
     icons, dropdowns and similar things not appearing properly.
   * #3634 Improved M4A/AAC support. Previously the target bitrate was 
     not honored at all, now it can be set between 98 and 160 kbit/s (mono)
     or 196 and 320 kbit/s (stereo). The UI does not yet reflect these limits.

  looping as its major new features.
  Smaller changes:
  - Context menus have been added in more places.
  - In the preferences, Tracks > Track behaviors > Editing a clip
    can move other clips is now disabled by default
  - The spectrogram defaults have been changed: scale type to Mel

- Update to release 3.0.0 and add patch for wxWidgets test:
  audacity-remove-wx-test.patch
- Add another useless return after assert to:
  audacity-no_return_in_nonvoid.patch
- Upstream changes:
 *Audacity 3.0.0 is a major update on our previous release
  We’ve changed the format in which we save Audacity projects! 
  Previously we saved projects as a sometimes large number of small
  files, with an ‘.aup’ file to coordinate the lot. This way of
  doing things is sometimes called ‘pile of files’ storage.
 *We did have time to improve our ‘Noise Gate’ effect and add a
  new analyzer, ‘Label Sounds’, that can label sounds and silences
  We also made a few small tweaks elsewhere. You can now import
  and export macros, and there are a couple of new commands for
  using the last used tool or last used analyzer that you can give
  shortcuts to.
 *We also fixed over 160 bugs that had been accumulating over the
  years. This is quite a staggering amount of work. The majority
  of these bugs were minor problems, easily worked around.
  Some though were really juicy high priority bugs that would have
  mattered a lot to the people affected by them. We’re really glad
  to have these bugs fixed now.

- Upstream changes and fixes:
  *Waveform colorways:
   You can optionally change the colorway of the waveforms
   displayed in your project. The setting is per track and not per
   project so you can have multiple colorways in the same project. 
  *"Save Other" reverts to "Export" in the File menu:
   When we made the menu changes for 2.2.0 we introduced an entry
   into the File menu called "Save Other" which led to a sub-menu
   for exporting various audio formats.

      was about what happens when Audacity is recording and runs
      out of storage.
    + The problems of incomplete support for macOs Sierra have
      been resolved (including bug 290, bug 1567, bug 1702, and bug

- Update to 2.1.0:
  + Changes and Improvements:
    * LADSPA and VST effects now support real-time preview,
      save/load of user presets and saving effect settings across
      sessions. Note: Real-time preview does not yet support
      latency compensation.

      You can now enter the speed change as a multiplier e.g. "2" is
      twice as fast. 
    * New "Crossfade Tracks" effect can be used for crossfading two
      tracks. This replaces Cross Fade In and Cross Fade Out.
    * Nyquist Prompt and most shipped Nyquist effects now have

      and Playback Meters, half-height so they can be wider while
      docked, in gradient style.
    * A frequency selection can now be made (and spectral edit
      effects applied to those frequencies) when in a spectrogram
      view. You can also create or adjust frequency selections in a
      new "Spectral Selection Toolbar" (available at View > Toolbars).
    * Transcription Toolbar (Play-at-speed) can now loop play and
      cut-preview.

   * Spectrogram log (f) view displayed incorrectly until
     vertically zoomed.
   * Fixed crash after zooming out on vertical scale beyond +/-1.0.
   * Selections made with Selection Toolbar were not restored after

     prevented Audacity recognising the installed FFmpeg or the
     FFmpeg specified in audacity.cfg.
   * Fix "Audacity already running" error when using the
     command-line or context menu to open multiple or further files.
   * Fix segfault exporting an FFmpeg format to an unwritable folder.

  Bug fixes for:
   * Interface:
     * Region Restore did not restore the region after using Preferences. 
     * Dragging selections with the keyboard or Selection Toolbar digits 
       was very slow.  
     * (Windows) Help > About Audacity crashed when run in Magyar language.

   * Click or drag on the Timeline after Loop Play continued to loop.
   * Transcription Toolbar did not play slower than 0.1x speed.
   * (Linux) Audacity did not build if python 2 was not available.  
  Changes and Improvements:
   * Interface:
     * Redesigned, searchable Keyboard Preferences with Tree, Name and Key views.  
     * Edit Menu: "Cut" and "Delete" are now in the top level of the menu.

       Note: the previous "Snap To On" keyboard shortcut will no longer work.   
     * "Snap To" settings are now independent for each project.
   * Effects:
     * Truncate Silence: redesigned with simpler option "Truncate Detected 
       Silence" to shorten to the specified length without compressing silence.
     * VST effects: New "Settings" dialog lets you specify buffer size (for 
       faster processing) and enable buffer delay compensation (to prevent
       inserted silence). Compensation may cause a crash in a few plug-ins. 
     * VST effects now support standard FXP presets.  
     * LV2 effects are now supported on all platforms (textual interface only).    

   * Import or export using FFmpeg now requires FFmpeg 1.2 or later (or libav
     0.8 or later). For recommended downloads of recent FFmpeg please visit:
     http://manual.audacityteam.org/o/man/faq_installation_and_plug_ins.html#ffdown .
   * New Tamil translation (largely complete). 
   * (Windows) FLAC exports can now exceed 2 GB in size. 
   * (OS X) Easier Audacity installation using the DMG: drag the Audacity folder
     to the /Applications shortcut, 
   * (OS X) Audacity 2.0.6 will not officially support OS X 10.10 Yosemite when 
     released (in particular, Apple Audio Units may not open in Audacity).
   * (Linux) Self-compiled builds of Audacity now search for system LADSPA 
     effects in /usr/lib/ladspa.

Fri Mar 29 09:25:00 UTC 2013 - kkaempf@suse.com

- Update to version 2.0.3
  Bug fixes
  * General
    - Crash using Undo whilst time-shifting a track.
    - Crash using Repair if the selection extended into an empty track.
    - Export Multiple didn't prevent export if there was no audio or all
      audio was muted. This allowed export of small invalid files.
  * Time Track
    - Loop Play of a speeded-up track inserted silence.
    - Playback and rendering was significantly inaccurate, creating audible
      and visual glitches.
  * Accessibility
    - The mnemonics character "&" was read out by screen readers in most of
       the Preferences choices.
    - NVDA did not read static text in most dialogs. Text can now be read by
      using INSERT + B.
    - JAWS and Window-eyes misread the "Duration" control in Silence
      Generator.
    - Toolbar buttons could not be pressed by ENTER
    - Other interface bug fixes.
  Changes and Improvements
  * Resampling
    - The SoX Resampler library (libsoxr) has replaced libresample in
      Audacity releases, offering both higher quality and greater speed.
  * Time Tracks new features
    - "Set Range" now changes only the range of the Time Track, preserving
      the pitch/speed set by any existing warp points.
    - Vertical scale added with options for linear and logarithmic display
      and interpolation.
    - Upper and lower speed limits will now be remembered when saving and
      reopening a project in 2.0.3. Warp points in projects saved by
      previous Audacity versions will be correctly restored in 2.0.3.
    - Warp points saved in a 2.0.3 project will be preserved if opened in
      previous versions but playback and display will be incorrect.
  * New effects
    - Studio Fade Out (uses a filtered "S" curve).
    - Adjustable Fade (accessible effect for creating partial fades and
      adjustable fade shapes).
    - Bass and Treble (replaces Bass Boost).
  * General
    - Real sample rates up to 384000 Hz are now supported for playback and
      recording in high resolution devices (the maximum is up to 192000 Hz
      for Windows DirectSound host).
    - Labeled Regions in Edit Menu is renamed to "Labeled Audio" and now
      allows splits to be placed at point labels. Labeled audio regions that
      touch without overlapping are treated as separate regions. Overlapping
      labeled audio regions are treated as a single region.
    - New Croatian translation of Audacity.
  * Compilation
    - CMake is required in order to build libsoxr.

- removed audacity-implicit.patch and audacity-2.0.2-docdir.patch
  both included in 2.0.3

Wed Mar 14 15:06:03 UTC 2012 - reddwarf@opensuse.org

- Update to version 2.0.0

  * Bug fixes for:

   - Interface:
     - Fixed playback speed and synchronization problems when dragging
       clips or tracks between tracks having different sample rates.

     - Imports and Exports:
       - Fixed crashes when changing the sample format of read-directly WAV
         or AIFF files using the Track Drop-Down Menu.
       - Fixed a crash importing MP3 files that had duplicate metadata tags
         (this is a bug in current libsndfile which has been patched in
         Audacity; MP3 files mislabeled as WAV which have duplicate tags
         will still crash Audacity on Linux if Audacity has been compiled
         against an affected version of system libsndfile).
     - Fixed an issue where excessively high or corrupted sample values in
       the audio could corrupt exports from the start of the problem for
       the rest of the file, and could corrupt the rest of the project.
    - Fixed Audacity could not be compiled against FFmpeg
      0.7.x and 0.8.x.

   - Effects and Analysis:
     - Fixed crash on launch when using "Ambisonic Decoders (PC)" VST
       plug-ins and other plug-ins that enable additional floating point
       exceptions.
     - Fixed Plot Spectrum background could be transparent on some machines.
     - Bug fixes for Click Track, High Pass, Low Pass and Vocal Remover.
     - Chirp, Tone and Silence generators now remember their settings.

   - Other miscellaneous bug fixes.

  * Changes and Improvements:

   - New Interface preference to show the track name in the display (this
     is off by default).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec 20 00:00:00 CET 2011 - detlef@links2linux.de

- Update to version 1.3.14

  * Bug fixes for:

   - Interface:
     - Excessive delay occurred when typing into labels in long projects. 
     - Last digit of TimeText controls could not be manipulated in some formats.
     - (Windows, OS X) Play and Record shortcuts did not work after clicking in
       Device Toolbar. 
     - (OS X, Linux) Crash occurred if Toolbars were reset during playback or
       recording. 
   - Imports and Exports:
     - MP2 files were not importable without FFmpeg library or an import rule. 
     - Files that could only be imported using FFmpeg imported as noise with
       no error message if FFmpeg was not available. 
     - Files containing PCM audio but an incorrect extension (such as MP3) 
       caused a freeze. 
   - Effects and Analysis:
     - An empty command could be added to a Chain which then displayed a 
       Nyquist error message when run.  
     - Plot Spectrum didn't preserve signal level if multiple tracks were 
       analyzed.  
   - Other bug fixes:
     - Audacity has been provisionally fixed so that it can no longer create 
       block files longer than the sample format or project format allows, 
       and can no longer delete these, which led to data loss. Any overlong 
       blocks found are preserved but "orphaned", so will appear as silence.
     - Orphan block files were wrongly reported if cutting or copying to 
       the clipboard then reopening the project in the same session. 
     - Fixed some crashes and incorrect movement of audio when dragging tracks.
     - (Windows) Data loss is now prevented when encountering a corrupted
       .aup file created in ANSI builds. 
     - (Linux) Restore building if USE_PORTMIXER is not defined. 
 
  * Changes and Improvements:

   - Normalize: Faster processing and improved interface. Left-right balance 
     in unsplit stereo tracks is now preserved by default, with a checkbox 
     option provided to process stereo channels independently.   
   - Spectrograms now allow window sizes up to 32768 and frequencies up to
     half the sample rate (the maximum possible).
   - Mix and Render now preserves clip length by not rendering white space 
     between time zero and first audio, and preserves audio before time zero.
     To retain silence before the audio starts, generate silence after render.     
   - Grouped some Edit Menu items into "Remove Audio" and "Clip Boundaries".  
   - CleanSpeech Mode removed from Interface Preferences (it still runs if it
     was enabled in a previous Audacity but can only be turned off there). 
   - (OS X) Added support for AudioUnit MusicEffects (but no MIDI support). 
   - (Linux) Set the per-user files directory per the program name set in 
     configure.
   - (Linux) Changed the default location of the Audacity temporary directory
     to be in /var/tmp not /tmp, so preserving the directory between reboots.
