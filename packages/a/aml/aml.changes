- Update to 0.3.0:
  * The time unit has been changed from milliseconds to microseconds
  * The global object registry has been replaced with weak references
  * It is now guaranteed that a callback will not be called after aml_stop().
  * Worker threads now keep references to work objects that are being
    executed. This ensures that they cannot be freed while they
    are being worked
