%description
Armadillo is a C++ linear algebra library (matrix maths).
Integer, floating point and complex numbers are supported,
as well as a subset of trigonometric and statistics functions.

%description -n %{soname}
Armadillo is a C++ linear algebra library (matrix maths).
Integer, floating point and complex numbers are supported,
as well as a subset of trigonometric and statistics functions.
Various matrix decompositions are provided through optional
integration with LAPACK and ATLAS libraries.
A delayed evaluation approach is employed (during compile time)
to combine several operations into one and reduce (or eliminate)
the need for temporaries. This is accomplished through recursive
templates and template meta-programming.

This package provides the shared libraries for armadillo.
