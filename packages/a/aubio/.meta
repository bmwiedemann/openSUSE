  <title>Library for real-time audio labelling</title>
  <description>Aubio is a library for real time audio labelling. Its features include
segmenting a sound file before each of its attacks, performing pitch
detection, tapping the beat and producing midi streams from live audio.
The name aubio comes from 'audio' with a typo: several transcription
errors are likely to be found in the results too.</description>
