- update to 0.4.6
  This version includes:
    * yinfast, a new version of the YIN pitch detection algorithm,
    that uses spectral convolution to compute the same results as
    the original yin, but with a cost O(N log(N)), making it much
    faster than the plain implementation (O(N^2))

    * Intel IPP optimisations (thanks to Eduard Mueller)

    * improved support for emscripten (thanks to Martin Hermant),
      which compiles the aubio library as a javascript module and
      lets you run aubio's algorithm directly from within a web-page.
  0.4.6 also comes with several bug fixes and improvements.

    aubioonset and aubiotrack to adjust the note and velocity of the

    system fixes, and platform compatibility.
