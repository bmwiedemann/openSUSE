  <title>Alternative FastCGI module for Apache2</title>
  <description>What is mod_fcgid? It is a binary compatibility alternative to Apache
module mod_fastcgi.

mod_fcgid has a new process management strategy, which concentrates on
reducing the number of fastcgi server, and kick out the corrupt fastcgi
server as soon as possible.

To load the module into Apache, run the command &quot;a2enmod fcgid&quot; as
root.

See /etc/apache2/conf.d/mod_fcgid.conf and
/usr/share/doc/packages/apache2-mod_fcgid for configuration.</description>
