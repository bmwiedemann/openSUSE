%description
You start the game with the map filled with walls and a few atoms, which you can
move in any direction. However, the atoms won't stop until they hit a wall or
another atom.

You can see a preview of what molecule you have to build, and you have to do your
best to find where to build the molecule, and move the atoms there.
