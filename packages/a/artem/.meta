  <title>A CLI program to convert images to ASCII art</title>
  <description>Artem is a small cli program, written in rust, to easily convert images to ascii art, named after the latin word for art. By default it tries to use truecolor, if the terminal does not support truecolor, it falls back to 16 Color ANSI. When the ascii image is written to a file, the image will not use colors. It supports .jpeg, .png, .gif, .webp and many more.</description>
