- version update to 0.19.0
  Enhancements:
  * Support for HTTP-POST binding on Singe Logout endpoint.
  * Update documentation.
  Cleanup:
  * Raise minimum Lasso version to 2.4, cleaning up legacy code for
    compatibility with older versions, including the obsolete
    `MellonIdPPublicKeyFile` setting which was not working with recent
    Lasso versions.

- Update to 0.18.1
  * Logout endpoint should handle idP POST response
  * mellon_create_metadata.sh: Fix compatibility with OpenSSL 3
  * Add some clarification to the documentation
  * Add encryption certificate to generated metadata
- Changes in 0.18.0
  * CVE-2021-3639 Redirect URL validation bypass - Version 0.17.0 and
    older of mod_auth_mellon allows the redirect URL validation to be
    bypassed by specifying an URL formatted as ///fishing-site.example.com/logout.html.
    In this case, the browser would interpret the URL differently
    than the APR parsing utility mellon uses and redirect to
    fishing-site.example.com. This could be reproduced with:
    https://rp.example.co.jp/mellon/logout?ReturnTo=///fishing-site.example.com/logout.html
    This version fixes that issue by rejecting all URLs that start with "///".
  * A new option MellonSessionIdleTimeout that represents the amount of
    time a user can be inactive before the user's session times out in seconds.
  * Several build-time fixes
  * The CookieTest SameSite attribute was only set to None if mellon configure option
    MellonCookieSameSite was set to something other than default. This is now fixed.
- add libtool and xmlsec1-openssl-devel as new dependencies
- set Buildarch to noarch for docs sub-package

Thu Sep 10 14:19:03 UTC 2020 - Kristyna Streitova <kstreitova@suse.com>

- Update to 0.17.0
  * New option MellonSendExpectHeader (default On) which allows to
    disable sending the Expect header in the HTTP-Artifact binding to
    improve performance when the remote party does not support this
    header.
  * Set SameSite attribute to None on on the cookietest cookie.
  * Bump default generated keysize to 3072 bits in
    mellon_create_metadata
  * Validate if the assertion ID has not been used earlier before
    creating a new session.
  * Release session cache after calling invalidate endpoint.
  * In MellonCond directives, fix a bug that setting the NC option
    would also activate substring match and that REG would activate
    REF.
  * Fix MellonCond substring match to actually match the substring on
    the attribute value
