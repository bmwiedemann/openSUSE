  * Drag all selected lines when Alt is held down when dragging in the audio display
  * Automation now uses LuaJIT in Lua 5.2 mode rather than Lua 5.1

  * Lua functions which take a path have been patched to support UTF-8 on Windows   
  * Add a warning when a script using a bold or italic variant of a font that doesn't actually exist, as emboldening done by the renderer may not match what is seen in Aegisub
  * Make the installer translatable and use the language selected in the installer for Aegisub's UI language

  * The subtitles grid has gained as Characters Per Second column, with customizable warning and error thresholds (#609)
  * Undo now restores the selected lines and cursor position that were active when the change being undone occured
  * Double-clicking on a word which is right next to a \N no longer selects the \N along with the word
  * Make default subtitle styles customizable: when creating a new file or importing from a format without style information, the styles from a catalog of your choice are automatically imported into the script (#962)
