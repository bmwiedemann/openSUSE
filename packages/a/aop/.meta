  <title>Ambassador of Pain</title>
  <description>Ambassador of Pain is a curses based arcade game for Linux/UNIX
with only 64 lines of sourcecode.

The goal is to drive the hoovercraft (O) trough the level into
the 'at' sign (@) and reach as much points as possible by reducing
the number of moves and don't losing any time.
Lost lifes (0) can easily be picked up by simply drive over them.</description>
