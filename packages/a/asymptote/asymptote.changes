- Update to version 2.67:
  * Support was added for importing and inputting URLs.

    zoom in and out, rather than expanding and shrinking the
    viewport.

    in AsyGL is avoided.

  * The copy constructors for path and path3 were fixed.
  * Asymptote errors no longer cause Xasy to hang.

  * The error location is displayed in the console.
  * Segmentation faults were fixed.
  * The documentation was updated and the code was reformatted.

- Update to release 2.65
  * A bug in rendering 2D preview images of a 3D scene was fixed.

    hanging. A more accurate Bezier approximation to the sphere
    was implemented. An initial perpendicular direction can now
    be specified for the rotation minimizing frame for a path3;
    the previous direction is no longer cached between calls.
