Wed Dec  7 11:31:17 UTC 2022 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Do not set everything inside doc/ mode 644; otherwise the
  directories are set 644 as well, which means no files inside are
  accessible. This resulted in the past in doc/ actually not being
  added to the devel package.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug 17 21:24:47 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 2.3.1:
  * Added value sanity check & warning to chartread patch by patch mode.
  * Fixed crash on 64 bit MSWin in spectro/aglob due to changing SDK
    declarations for _findfirst().
  * Fixed one remaining problem with not coping with "Colour" spelling rather
    than "Color" in cxf2ti3.
  * Add code in cgats write to check for float format problems when faced with
    -inf or +inf value.
  * Fix i1Pro3 highres in ccxxmake, dispcal & dispread.
  * Changed OS X usb reset to re-enumerate instead, as reset does nothing on OS
    X >= 10.8.
  * Added spectro/instlib.api.txt file to public distribution.
  * Fixed possible crashes in xicc/ccss.c and spectro/oeminst.c  

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan 26 13:23:17 UTC 2022 - Paolo Stivanin <info@paolostivanin.com>

- Update to version 2.3.0:
* Fixed spotread -YL (i1Pro1/2 lamp remediation) to function even
  if calibration is impossible due to the white reference being out of tolerance.
* Fix SpyderX faulty initial black calibration 
* Added icomuf_reset_before_close flag for SpyderX, as some versions
  of the instrument have been reported to lock up after use.
* Modified the ArgyllCMS CIECAM02 implementation to include a blue
  hue linearization tweak, to improve the "blue goes purple" effect
  when gamut mapping or clipping highly saturated blues to smaller gamuts.
* Added spotread -Y y option that forces the listing of instrument
  specific display calibrations in the usage, even for serial instruments.
* Removed native i1d3 C6 instrument support as a favor to X-Rite.
* Improved cxf2ti3 so that it should cope with XML that uses "Colour"
  spelling rather than "Color".
* Added I1D3_ESCAPE environment variable to allow a user to potentialy
  use any current or future OEM coded i1d3 instrument.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep  7 19:33:45 UTC 2021 - Stanislav Brabec <sbrabec@suse.com>

- Update to version 2.2.0:
  * Added native i1Pro3 and i1Pro3 Plus driver.
  * Fix bug in applycal.c where it gets an "Error - Write file: 1,
    icmTextDescription_write: ascii string is shorter" error on
    replacing one calibration with another.
  * Improved i1pro & Munki patch recognition to work much more
    reliably with a slow swipe speed.
  * Fixed oeminst to work with spyder V5.5. setup.exe
  * Fixed bug in oemdld that prevented HTML encoded characters in
    download file decoding properly, which prevented certain
    filenames from working.
  * Fixed bug in ccxxmake -S -f where save error wasn't being fully
    reported, and display technology presence check was faulty.
  * Fixed typo in display technology, VPA -> PVA.
  * Made Klein K10A "Lights Off" command timeout a soft error. For
    some reason this command doesn't seem to be implemented on some
    K10A's.
  * Added CIE dE2000 to spotread output.
  * Fixed accidental global "wrl" in gamut/gamut.h that cases
    compile warnings.
  * For more see http://www.argyllcms.com/doc/ChangesSummary.html
- Drop argyllcms--gcc--fno-common.patch (upstreamed with exception
  of static declaration of struct huft, which is not required).

-------------------------------------------------------------------

  (bsc#1160256#c5).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar  5 02:49:25 CET 2020 - sbrabec@suse.com

- Update to version 2.1.2:
  * Added -d option to spotread to print out Density values.
  * Many i1Pro2 fixes.
  * Changed targen round down/up to 0%/100% to have a tighter
    tollerance of 0.5% rather than 2%, so that -n values of
    L* 1 and 99 are not rounded. 
  * Fix bug in xicclu -v2 option when operating on a .cal file.

    0.05.
- Fix build with with -fno-common, which is the default in gcc-10
  (bsc#1160256, argyllcms--gcc--fno-common.patch).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jan  5 02:53:35 UTC 2020 - Stefan Brüns <stefan.bruens@rwth-aachen.de>

- Use pkgconfig(libpng) BuildRequires, the build system looks for
  the unversioned libpng.so and falls back to its bundled version.
- Remove bundled zlib source, otherwise it is built even when the
  system zlib is found. This triggers a fatal rpm check failure on
  Leap 15.x due to compiler warnings.
- Also remove bundled png/tiff/axTLS sources.
- Remove pkgconfig(mxml) dependency, ArgyllCMS bundles a patched one.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec  4 17:06:10 UTC 2019 - Richard Brown <rbrown@suse.com>

  * Added -w parameter to spotread, to use the -i parameter illuminant for L*a*b* calculation
- Remove obsolete patch argyllcms-decl.patch 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr 24 09:16:27 UTC 2019 - Martin Liška <mliska@suse.cz>

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 14 15:44:45 UTC 2017 - guoyunhebrave@gmail.com

- Update to version 1.9.2 and update patches
  * Added CMYKOGB and CMYKRGB 7 channel ink preset, and made targen
    more flexible in matching pre-conditioning profiles to targen ink
    selection.
  * Fix oeminst for OS X save location.
  * Fix oeminst for OS X Spyder 4 CD calibration file location. 
  * Improved robustness of ChromeCast discovery, and added some minimal
    diagnostics.
  * Improved robustness of targen ofps patch generation when using less
    well behaved pre-conditioning profiles.
  * Fixed oeminst so that it locates cdrom's in Linuxes latest mount
    point of /run/media/$USER/.
  * Fixed bug in i1pro2 driver, in which strip calibration would fail
    if instrument had been first calibrated with ARGYLL_DISABLE_I1PRO2_DRIVER
    set, and then calibrated with ARGYLL_DISABLE_I1PRO2_DRIVER unset.
  * Added option to icclib to write Output profiles using 'chad' tag if
    the ARGYLL_CREATE_DISPLAY_PROFILE_WITH_CHAD environment variable is
    set. This is not recommended for normal use, but may assist
    compatibility with other systems.
  * Added JETI spectraval support, including Bluetooth access.
  * Added support for the Klein K10 connecting via a serial port.
  * Fixed bug in Colormunki Smile driver that causes crash on Ubuntu
    16.04.1 LTS.
  * Modified "lp" intent to greatly reduce eliminate Helmholtz-Kohlrausch
    appearance modelling.
  * Fixed problem with targen -g, in that the corresponding XYZ values
    had double the power applied, rather than none. This was causing
    problems with printtarg spacer colors.
  * Extensive re-write of colorimetric nearest clipping code in rspl/rev.c
    to restore precision that was lost in the speedups made in V1.0.0. The
    nnrev setup now takes a lot longer with   high resolution CMYK profiles
    though. This corrects a "green becoming too yellow" problem for mapping
    from ProPhoto space with some RGB devices.
  * Change dispwin to properly set X11 DirectColor and take account of
    TrueColor Colormap.  This fixes problem with NVidia linux driver 364.12
    exposing a VideoLUT depth that is different from the frame buffer depth.
  * Change icclib to automatically repair icmTextDescription strings that
    have an allocation that is longer than their size.
  * Added i1Pro Lamp Drift test and fix functions to spotread (-Y l|L options).
  * Change colprof so that -s -S will accept general compression percentage
    as an alternative to a source colorspace/image gamut.
  * Added optional conversion from native Gretag-MacBeth & X-Rite reflective
    calibration standards to/from XRGA.
  * Changed OS X GUI support code so as not to switch to "interact with the
    Dock" mode until actual GUI element is to be displayed. This prevents
    batch commands with optional GUI elements from blocking normal GUI
    interactions.
  * Re-jigged OS X UI code to use the main thread to avoid window
    creation timing issues and a warning backtrace on OS X 10.11.
  * Added CMP_Digital_Target-7.cht
  * Fix spec2cie to cope with .ti3 files that are missing device values,
    so that it can process a wider range of input CIE reference files.
  * Changed implementation of ARGYLL_NOT_INTERACTIVE on MSWin to make
    it more reliable when operated progromatically.
  * Fixed chartread so that if you are reading patch by patch, the
    location strings can be arbitrary (i.e. they don't have to conform
    to an alpha/num strip/patch pattern.)
  * Added support for Sencore ColorPro V, IV & III colorimeters
    (based on Sequel Chroma colorimeter.).
- Drop argyllcms-udev151.patch

Tue Nov 24 20:16:44 UTC 2015 - p.drouand@gmail.com

- Update to version 1.8.3
  * Added SpyderCheckr24 scaning .cht and .cie files.
  * Fixed USB problem with i1pro (Rev B & D ?), where communications 
    would occasionally break down on fast systems.
  * Added another fixed display intergration time to i1pro non-adaptive
    emission mode to cope with higher brightness displays.
  * Added workaround for i1d3 Rev. B status code 0x83 on very low 
    light measurement
  * Fixed minor bug in i1d3.c that truncated serial number string.
  * Fixed bug in Klein K10 driver - adaptive measurement wasn't properly 
    using all the extra measurements.
  * Improved Klein K10 driver to be more robust when lights off command 
    returns bogus error codes, or causes a cascade of bogus measurement 
    errors.
  * Added workaround for OS X 10.9+ "App Nap" problem.
  * Added maximum sensor frequency check for Spyder & i1d3 drivers, 
    so that erronious readings due to excessive brightness can't be missed.
  * Changed chartread so that it doesn't warn of a possible wrong strip
    being read, nor allows bi-directional strip reading, if "printtarg -r" 
    was used. A warning will be issued if "printtarg -r" was used, and 
    "chartread -B" wasn't used.
  * Fixed collink for eeColor Full range RGB to use output curve 
    ("second" 1D curves) to compensate for cLUT being wired for 1.0 
    output from 1.0 input.
  * Added "lp" gamut mapping intent :- Luminance Preserving Perceptual, 
    for Photographers concerned with maintaining tonal variations.
  * Fixed bugs in image specific gamut mapping that were degrading 
    the accuracy of the result.
  * Re-wrote gamut smoothing code, and re-tuned it to behave similarly 
    to the V1.8.2 release.
  * Changed default viewing condition glare to 5%, to smooth out shadow tone curve.
  * Reduced the level of Helmholtz-Kohlrausch effect in CIECAM02 
    implementation in the light of visual experiments.
- Changes from version 1.8.2
  * Fixed endless loop bug in alternate calibration selectors code.
- Changes from version 1.8.1
  * Fixed bug in "spec2cie -n" wrong field indexes were being used.
  * Fixed colorimeter calibration selectors to add in alternate 
    selectors if the letters are free.
- Changes from version 1.8.0
  * Added support for the Image Engineering EX1 spectroradiometer.
  * Added support for the SwatchMate Cube reflective colorimeter, 
    with improved accuracy.
  * Added Added Television Lighting Consistency Index (EBU TLCI-2012 Qa) 
    to spotread and specplot output.
  * Added R9 value to CRI value in spotread and specplot output.
  * Added workaround for JETI specbos having been calibrated by
    a 3rd party, and its calibrated range being out of sync with 
    its claimed range.
  * Added support for "EMISINPUT" type .ti3 file.
  * Build using OpenSSL rather than axTLS if it is built on Linux.
  * Fixed stack space problem in OS X UI programs by expanding main 
    thread proxy to have 8MB instead of the default 512K.
  * Updated built in libtiff to V4.0.4beta.
  * Changed CGATS format to not emit unknown keyword declaration ("KEYWORD")
    by default.
  * Added inst_calc_cond_mask to inst.h to allow for flags in calibration 
    conditions. A consequence of this is that calc needs to be masked with 
    this when comparing against a specific condition, and the inst_calc_optional_flag
    should be cleared if it is set, before callint inst->calibrate() if the 
    user wants to proceed with a particular calibration.
  * Fixed bug with dispcal -e N
  * Fixed bug in xicclu -fg and -kp
  * Added dispcal -x x option to allow reading a chart and manually entering
    the XYZ values.
  * Fix spyder4 & 5 bug where some display types were set as refresh 
    when they shouldn't be.
  * Fix collink "Warning :- RGB black hack trigger more than once!" 
    when -b is used with input video encoding (-e).
  * Changed colprof so that the default ICC description is the base 
    filename rather than the whole file path.
  * Fix technology type and display type selector "uniqueification"
    bug  that shows up in "ccxxmake -??".
  * Add OEM field to ccmx and ccss files to mark files that have
    been installed from OEM disk, so that custom ccmx & ccss files 
    can be given suggested selector letter priority (+ ref/CRT.ccss).
  * Tweak CGATS write format to avoid scientific notation until the 
    numbers are bigger and smaller (i.e until e6 and e-6 are needed).
- Changes from version 1.7.0
  * Improved gamut mapping to reduce unnecessary changes to less 
    saturated colors  such as skin tones.
  * Add support for DataColor Spyder 5.
  * Add support for ColorHug2 colorimeter.
  * Add support for Klein K10-A colorimeter.
  * Added Google ChromeCast as a test patch generator for Video displays.
  * Added ls2ti3 tool to convert LightSpace .bcs files to .ti3.
  * Added IRIDAS .cube 3DLut format support to collink.
  * Add X3D and X3DOM support as an alternative to VRML, and make X3DOM 
    the default.
  * Add better cross compatibility with non-Argyll ICC profiles using 
    ArgyllCMS 'arts' tag to mark 'wtpt' Absolute Colorimetric chromaticity
    transform, as well as implement proper absolute colorimetric intent 
    for Display profiles use the 'chad' tag. Note that the standard 
    ICC profiles provided by ArgyllCMS in the ref directory (such as sRGB etc.)
    now include an 'arts' tag.
  * Ignore any patches that have zero values for creating Display profiles,
    unless they are for device zero.
  * Fix various instrument communications problems for JETI specbos, 
    DTP20, DTP92 & DTP94.
  * Fix gestaltSystemVersion warning on OS X 10.10.
  * Fix very major bug in illumread. It wasn't actually working at all
    since V1.4.0.
  * Added collink -I[gG][:p.p]:x.x options that allows an output offset 
    gamma curve be targetted instead of BT1886.
  * Added dispcal and collink -b black point hack. This forces the input 
    zero to map to the output zero for well behaved displays, reducing 
    dependence on the instrument accuracy for a very dark black point.
  * Added preset list of display techologies to select from in ccxxmake.
  * Added a -P prune option to profcheck, that creates a .ti3 file pruned
    of any patches that have a delta E fit error greater than a threshold.
    This may be of use in eliminating bad reading values from a measurement set.
  * Added histogram plot option -h to both profcheck and verify.
  * Added a dispread & fakeread -Z option to set the number of bits to
    quantize the test values to.
  * Fixed bug in targen - the -V dark emphasis wasn't being applied to OFPS 
    generated points.
  * Make sure that if an instrument display reading is interrupted by a
    forced calibration, that the user is asked to place it back on the 
    display before resuming the measurements.

  + Fixed bug in spotread, dispcal & dispread for CCSS capable
    instruments where refresh display types was being ignored if a
    custom observer was used, and/or the custom observer as being
    ignored, and/or a  CCMX was being ignored.
  + Renamed verify to colverify to avoid clash with MSWin program
    of the same name. Made it print the patch location for -v2 if
    it is present in the file.
  + Changed targen to ensure that -V and -p options effects are
    reflected in the resulting expected CIE values of the .ti1
    file.
  + Changed targen so that -V parameter also affects single
    channel, grey wedge, grid & body centered grid point
    distribution.
  + Changed colprof to deal with variable grid distribution in a
    more neuanced way, to reduce overshoot artifacts when the -V
    parameter is used.
  + Changed colprof to used a power_like function for the grid
    distribution shape from the -V parameter, so as to avoid issues
    with a power curve infinte slope near zero.
  + Changed colprof to used a scaled down value of the targen -V
    parameter as the default for its -V parameter.
  + Added a special case to collink for RGB video input encoding to
    (attempt) to fine tune the black point to compensate for it
    (probably) not falling on a cLUT grid point. & out encoding.
  + Tweaked dispcal to try and improve accuracy of black point
    calibration.
