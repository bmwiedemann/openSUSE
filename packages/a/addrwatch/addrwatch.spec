%description
This is a tool similar to arpwatch. It main purpose is to monitor
network and log discovered Ethernet to IPv4/IPv6 address
pairings. It supports monitoring multiple network interfaces,
monitoring of VLAN tagged (802.1Q) packets, and can output to
stdout, plain text file, syslog, sqlite3 and MySQL. Addrwatch
tracks IPv6 addresses of hosts using IPv6 privacy extensions
(RFC4941).

The main difference between arpwatch and addrwatch is the format
of output files.

While arpwatch stores only current state of the pairings and
allows to send email notification when a pairing change occurs,
addrwatch do not keep persistent network pairings' state, but
instead logs all the events that allow pairing discovery.
