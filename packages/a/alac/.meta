  <title>Apple Lossless Audio Codec</title>
  <description>The Apple Lossless Audio Codec (ALAC) is an audio codec developed by Apple and
supported on iPhone, iPad, most iPods, Mac and iTunes.  ALAC is a data
compression method which reduces the size of audio files with no loss of
information.  A decoded ALAC stream is bit-for-bit identical to the original
uncompressed audio file.
