  <title>Firmware for Atmel at76c50x Wireless Network Chips</title>
  <description>The drivers for Atmel at76c50x wireless network chips in the Linux 2.6.x kernel
and at http://at76c503a.berlios.de/ do not include the firmware and this
firmware needs to be loaded by the host on most cards using these chips. 

This package provides the firmware images that should be automatically loaded
as needed by the hotplug system. It also provides a small loader utility that
can be used to accomplish the same thing when hotplug is not in use.</description>
