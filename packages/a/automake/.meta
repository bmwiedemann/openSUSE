  <title>A Program for Automatically Generating GNU-Style Makefile.in Files</title>
  <description>Automake is a tool for automatically generating &quot;Makefile.in&quot; files
from &quot;Makefile.am&quot; files.  &quot;Makefile.am&quot; is a series of &quot;make&quot; macro
definitions (with rules occasionally thrown in).  The generated
&quot;Makefile.in&quot; files are compatible with the GNU Makefile standards.</description>
