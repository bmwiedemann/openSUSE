  <title>Another Tool for Language Recognition</title>
  <description>ANTLR, Another Tool for Language Recognition, (formerly PCCTS) is a
language tool that provides a framework for constructing recognizers,
compilers, and translators from grammatical descriptions containing C++
or Java actions (you can use PCCTS 1.xx to generate C-based parsers).
