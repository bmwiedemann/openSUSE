Fri Jan  7 10:36:16 UTC 2022 - John Paul Adrian Glaubitz <adrian.glaubitz@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.7.10
  + Remove using of try_lock
    * Try lock is not available in Windows Server 2008. Remove it from our debug build
- from version 0.7.9
  + Empty payload fixes
    * Fix a crash on Windows when the will payload was empty (precondition
      is turned into a fatal assert on Windows CD builds still)
    * Fix a decode error when receiving a message with an empty payload
- from version 0.7.8
  + Stability fix
    * Fixes a crash due to a race condition in the mqtt connection logic
- from version 0.7.7
  + Allow for null on-message callbacks in subscribe
    * Fixes a crash when the on-message callback is null for a subscription
    * Updates the public API documentation with some missing parameters and
      annotations as to what parameters can be null
- from version 0.7.6
  + Data race fixes
    * Fixes several data races related to the outstanding requests table
      and a request's timeout task.
- from version 0.7.5
  + Fix non-threadsafe hash-table accesses (take 2)
    * fix test function (#190)
- from version 0.7.4
  + Fix non-threadsafe hash-table accesses
    * Fix unsafe hash-table accesses (#189)
    * Fact: It's not safe to mutate aws_hash_table while holding an aws_hash_element.
    * Fact: `outstanding_requests_table` is accessed by multiple threads.
      We always hold a lock while accessing it.
    * Bug: There were several places where we release the lock, but continue to hold an
      aws_hash_element we got from a find() call. Once the lock is released another thread
      can mutate the `outstanding_requests_table`, leading to undefined behavior when the
      aws_hash_element is accessed again.
- from version 0.7.3
  + Direct mqtt through http proxy
    * Adds support for establishing direct mqtt connections through an http proxy
- from version 0.7.2
  + Publish payload
    * We now keep a deep copy of the publish payload. User don't need
      to keep the payload alive for the whole process.
- from version 0.7.1
  + Proxy refactor
    * Companion release to the new proxy systems in aws-c-http v0.6.2
