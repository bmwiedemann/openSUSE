  <title>Tool for rendering manifest changes on pull requests</title>
  <description>Argo CD Diff Preview is a tool that renders the diff between two branches in a Git repository. It is designed to render manifests generated by Argo CD, providing a clear and concise view of the changes between two branches. It operates similarly to Atlantis for Terraform, creating a plan that outlines the proposed changes.</description>
