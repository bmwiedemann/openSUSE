  *harden_atop.service.patch
  *harden_atopacct.service.patch
  *harden_atopgpu.service.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr 13 21:33:30 UTC 2021 - Ferdinand Thiessen <rpm@fthiessen.de>

- Update to version 2.6.0
  * Sort threads within process.
  * Individual threads within a process (key 'y') are shown in the
    order of their TID. With the additional key 'Y' threads within
    a process are sorted based on the current sort criterium.
  * Show the WCHAN per thread.
  * With the key 'W' is active, the wait channel is determined per
    thread and shown with the scheduling information (key 's').
  * Show runqueue delay per thread/process.
  * For every process (cumulated) and every thread the time spent
    waiting on the runqueue is shown as value 'RDELAY'.
  * Show other modified/new metrics:
    + PSI pressure during interval time is shown
    + Counter 'avio' (average I/O time) for fast disks in
      microseconds or nanoseconds
    + Counter 'zfarc' showing the current size of the ARC (cache)
      for ZFSonlinux
    + Counter 'swcac' showing the current size of the swap cache
    + Counter LOCKSZ showing the virtual locked memory size
  * Avoid crash with very high load average values.
  * Fix errors in reading InfiniBand states.
  * Support of rawlog files spanning multiple days.
  * The time specification to define the begin time (-b flag)
    and end time (-e flag) of both atop and atopsar is
    [YYYYMMDD]hhmm now
  * This also applies to the branch key ('b') when using atop
    interactively.
  * Support reading rawlog from a pipe.
  * Rawlog data can be read from a pipe by atop and atopsar with
    the option '-r -'. In this way, concatenated rawlog data from
    the command atopcat can be directly processed.
  * New program atopcat, the program atopcat concatenates rawlog
    files and writes this data to stdout. The output can be
    redirected to a new rawlog file or to atop/atopsar directly
    via a pipe (see option '-r -' of these commands).
    In this way e.g. weekly or monthly reports or extractions
    can be created.

Fri Jul 31 20:26:06 UTC 2020 - Matthias Eliasson <elimat@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 2.5.0 
  Modifications for atop:
  * Avoid using perf counters in VM
    New option 'perfevents' in the atoprc file to define if the Instructions
	Per Cycle (IPC) should be retrieved via the 'perf' counters. Specify
	value 'auto' (default), 'enable' or 'disable'. In case of 'auto', the
	Instructions Per Cycle counter will not be retrieved on VMs due to the
	overhead of reading this counter in a guest.
  * Improve daily rotation of logfile for systemd-based systems.
    Exchange the files /etc/cron.d/atop, /etc/logrotate.d/psaccs_atop,
	/etc/logrotate.d/psaccu_atop, /usr/share/atop/atop.daily,
	/var/log/atop/dummy_after and /var/log/atop/dummy_before by
	atop-rotate.service and atop-rotate.timer.
  * Bug fixes:
    Correction of PSI value 'io full'.
    Use smaps_rollup (if present) instead of smaps for better performance.
    Use writev instead of 3 single writes to avoid logfile corruption.
    Modified handling of error messages (remain visible after window is
	closed).
    Correct CID for containers created by Kubernetes.
    Allow reading a logfile via a named pipe (non-seekable).
  Modifications for atopconvert:
  * Show version of input file (even if only one parameter specified).
  General:
  * The format of the raw file is compatible with version 2.4.
- Run spec-cleaner
- Remove requires for cron and logrotate now that there is systemd service
  and timers handling logrotation
- Remove Requires(post) for permissions since atop does not use cron files anymore
- Refresh patch:
  * atop-makefile.patch
- Add atop defaults in /etc/default/atop

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug 20 11:32:08 CEST 2019 - kukuk@suse.de

- Package /etc/cron.d, as this is now part of cron which we don't
  want to require

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Feb 17 20:14:07 UTC 2019 - Matthias Eliasson <matthias.eliasson@gmail.com>

- Update to 2.4.0
  * Modifications for atop:
    + Support for Nvidia GPU statistics:
      A separate daemon atopgpud has been developed to maintain statistics of
	  Nvidia GPUs in the system. When this daemon is running, atop will
	  connect to this daemon and will get/show the GPU statistics with every
	  interval on system level and process level (key 'e').
      The atopgpud daemon will only be active when it is explicitly enabled 
	  (see man pages for more info).
    + Support for Infiniband statistics:
      Counters showing the bandwidth utilization of Infiniband ports
	  (system level) are added.
    + Support for Pressure Stall Information (PSI):
      The average pressure percentages of CPU, memory and I/O are reported
	  for the last 10, 60 and 300 seconds. These percentage are provided from
	  kernel 4.20 onwards.
    + Faster startup of atop:
      The allocation strategy for processes and threads has been improved,
	  which will specifically be noticable on larger systems with lots of
	  multi-threaded processes.
    + Configurable options for atop running in the background:
      Default options of script atop.daily can be overruled by
	  /etc/default/atop file.
    + CPU Instructions Per Cycle (IPC):
      For every CPU, the average number of instructions per CPU cycle is
	  shown as 'ipc'. Besides, a column is shown with the number of cycles
	  executed per second as `cycl` (shown as effective Hz frequency).
    + Various fixes:
      Various NFS counters corrected.
      Recognition of nvme and nbd disks.
      Recognition of DEADLINE scheduling policy.
      Proper handling of memory locking (improper handling caused malloc
	  failures in previous versions).
  * New program atopconvert:
    + This program can be used to convert the layout of older raw files to
	  newer raw files. Raw files from atop 2.0 onwards can be converted to
	  the newest version (now: 2.4).
  * Modifications for atopsar:
    + Reports can be printed now about the utilization of GPUs and Infiniband,
	  and about the PSI percentages.
  * General:
    + The format of the raw file is incompatible with earlier versions.
	  However, old raw files can be converted now by the program atopconvert
	  to be read or extended by newer atop versions.
- Clean with spec-cleaner
- Refresh atop-makefile.patch

Sun Jun 10 11:22:35 UTC 2018 - antoine.belvire@opensuse.org

- Update to 2.3:
  * Modifications for atop:
    + Support for Docker containers.
    + Improved gathering of process data.
    + Improved memory figures for processes.
    + Variable width for PID column.
    + Better handling when started via sudo (not entering stopped
    + state).
    + Handling of disk drives starting with 'xvd...'.
  * Modifications for atopacct:
    + Better error handling of Netlink interface.
    + Immediate reaction when receiving SIGTERM signal.
    + Bypass for kernel bug 190711 (Netlink interface not
      available).
    + Bypass for kernel bug 190271 (process accounting does not
      always start).
  * Modifications for atopsar:
    + Top-3 of resource consuming processes only shows active
      processes now.
  * General:
    + The format of the raw file is upward compatible with version
      2.2-3.
- Clean with spec-cleaner.

Tue Nov 22 14:11:06 UTC 2016 - coolo@suse.com

- update to 2.2:
     * Modifications for atop:
         a. New keys for process selection:
            '/' to select processes containing a particular search string in the command line arguments.
            'I' to select processes running with particular PIDs.
         b. New counters for NFS activity:
            On system level, counters are maintained about NFS traffic. Three new labels are introduced for this purpose:
            'NFS' for NFS server statistics (overall).
            'NFC' for NFS client statistics (overall).
            'NFM' for NFS client statistics per mounted NFS filesystem (so multiple lines possible).
         c. New counters for OpenVZ containers:
            CPU consumption and memory occupation are shown per container on system level (label 'CON').
            Container ID and virtual PID are shown on process level (when using key 'v' or 's').
         d. Bug fixes:
            The maximum transfer rate larger than 1 Gbit for ethernet interfaces is now correctly shown.
            The maximum transfer rate for wifi connections is now shown.
            For interfaces in general, the maximum transfer rate is shown as a separate column ('sp').
            
            Counters about virtual disk type 'xvd[a-z]' are shown.
            
            Several minor bugs have been solved.
     * Modifications for atopacct:
         a. Avoid that process accounting is reactivated too frequently (and unnecessary).
     * Modifications for atopsar:
         a. Add flags for NFS traffic ('-n' for NFS mounts, '-j' for overall NFS 
            client activity and '-J' for overall NFS server activity).
     * General:
         a. Support for systemd-based distributions has been added.
         b. The format of the raw file is incompatible with earlier versions. However, 
            the earlier version of atop is automatically activated when accessing an 
            older raw file.
- cleanup spec file - remove support for < 12.1

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Oct 18 12:40:40 UTC 2014 - pascal.bleser@opensuse.org

- update to 2.1:
  * OpenVZ support: virtual environment identifier per process (envID)
  * Bug solution: when the screen-width is larger than the total number of
    columns to be printed, empty columns are added, however one column too many
  * Removed useless empty column for memory statistics
  * Introduce the 'G' key to suppress showing/accumulating exited processes
    in the output
  * Support CPU frequencies for systems with Intel P-state driver
  * Introduction of new daemon atopacctd. This daemon switches on process
    accounting and transfers every accounting record to an accounting shadow
    file. The source accounting file will regularly be truncated, while the
    shadow files are written with a limited size in a queued way. Non-used
    shadow files are deleted regularly.
  * Bug-solution: segmentation fault when one of the process names in the
    system contains a newline
  * Introduce configurable colors: in the atoprc file, colors can be defined
    for information messages (default green), threads (default yellow), almost
    critical resources (default cyan) and critical resources (default red).
  * Limit the names of network interfaces to six characters max
  * Introduction of proportional memory size (PSIZE) per process. For the
    resident memory parts used by a process that are shared with other
    processes, only a proportional part (shared memory part divided by the
    number of sharers) is accounted to the process. Since the gathering of this
    value is rather time-consuming (reading the smaps file of every process),
    it is optional ('R' key or '-R' flag).
  * Increased number of LVMs and disks supported
  * Support for huge pages (total and in use).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul 26 07:48:55 UTC 2012 - pascal.bleser@opensuse.org

- update to 1.27-3:
  * service file for systemd
  * solved division-by-zero when maxfreq=0 and more precise coloring of
    concerning CPU-values when CPU overloaded
  * if setuid-root is set for atop, root-privileges are regained when reading
    /proc/pid/io (nowadays only readable for root) to obtain the disk stats per
    process
  * added EMC Power device recognition
  * better recognition of version of process accounting file
  * improved error handling when not enough columns or lines
  * suppress sorting of system resources by key F or flag -F (toggle)
  * create unique /tmp name for decompressed raw file
  * numerous cosmetic changes and man-page updates
  * improved screen handling
  * limited maximum file-size for process accounting file (200 MiB)
  * improved handling of process accounting
  * new key 'S' to make selections of system resources like logical volumes,
    disks and network interfaces (regular expression)
  * use of arrow-keys and PgUp/PgDown for vertical scroll
  * use of -> and <- keys for horizontal scroll of command line
  * support statistics for virtio disks (vd*)
  * fetching and displaying of individual threads
  * add various details about the memory usage of processes, like stack size,
    data size, shared library size and size used on swap
  * show new value about swap space usage per process
  * colors are shown now for separate system-level counters instead of for the
    entire line with counters
  * enhanced security: improved dropping of root privileges

Tue Mar 15 02:13:10 UTC 2011 - pascal.bleser@opensuse.org

- update to 1.26:
  * an additional value is shown for the current frequency and the current
    scaling percentage of the CPU
  * additional system-level counters are shown for the total number of threads
    that are running, sleeping interruptible, and sleeping uninterruptible
  * when the number of lines in a window is too small for the amount of
    system-level lines, the number of variable resources (like disks,
    interfaces, etc.) is limited automatically to be able to continue
  * the signal SIGUSR2 can be sent to atop to take one more sample and
    terminate (e.g. used to speed up suspend/hibernate)
  * support for the disk type 'mmcblk'

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May  3 12:18:43 UTC 2010 - pascal.bleser@opensuse.org
