Mon Apr 15 17:54:42 UTC 2013 - schwab@linux-m68k.org

- Update to aranym 0.9.15

 The main new feature of this release is the seamless mouse integration mode:

 o Mouse input handling is improved a lot. Now ARAnyM has a seamless mouse
   integration when new Clocky (2013/04/15) is loaded.
 o There is no need to manually ungrab or grab the mouse.
 o Also mouse grab on left button click now reacts on the first button
   click everytime (previously only if you had window focus) and the
   host and mouse cursor positions are synced.
 o And if you ungrab the mouse intentionally then it's not automatically
   grabbed when the host mouse pointer returns to ARAnyM window.
 o At last, the annoying "resetting weird mouse packet" error is gone, too.

 Bugs fixed:

 o Native Features were missing proper memory overflow checks and bugs
   in NatFeat drivers could kill the ARAnyM.
 o NFVDI had a bug (a race condition) in resolution switching.
 o build date of EmuTOS was decoded improperly

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct  1 21:04:40 UTC 2012 - schwab@linux-m68k.org

- Update to aranym 0.9.14.

 version 0.9.14 news:

 Mac users: check out the new bridged ethernet (see README_ethernet.rtf).

 All users: try out the new Single Blit Composing and Single Blit Refresh
 modes - they might give you a better video performance.

 There are also many compilation and build fixes for various MacOSX targets
 and few MPFR FPU fixes.

 And last but not least, there's a neat user requested feature - mouse ungrab
 (frees your keyboard and mouse from ARAnyM window so you can work in other
 applications while ARAnyM is running) simply by clicking the host middle
 mouse button (well, works only if you don't have the Eiffel mouse wheel
 emulation enabled in settings).

 version 0.9.13 news:

 A couple of important bugfixes accumulated in last few days:

   o USB NatFeat doesn't fail to claim devices in certain cases

   o MPFR FPU got fix for restarting of instructions after access error

   o JIT CPU version should work even when compiled with newer compilers

   o update your mmusetup.cnf in MiNT setup for larger FastRAM (see
     provided atari/mmusetup.cnf that is set for 512 MB FastRAM now)

 version 0.9.12 news:

 New features:

   o MPFR based new precise FPU emulation core. Somewhat slower than the
     normally used IEEE or UAE FPU emulation cores (about 5 times)
     but should be totally complete and precise. Enabled in Linux binary
     MMU builds (aranym-mmu). Hopefully Debian-m68k developers will enjoy it
     :-)

   o USB NatFeat fully usable: http://wiki.aranym.org/manual#usb
     With a FreeMiNT driver you can access your USB flash discs from
     the Atari side easily. First enter the SETUP GUI and plug in
     the desired USB device. The USB support is compiled in by default
     in all linux binary packages.

   o NF Clipboard implemented newly for BeOS

   o "aranym --version" will now list the built-in FPU core and also all
     NatFeats that are compiled in.

 Bugfixes:

   o memleaks in various files
   o blitter memmove fix
   o MacOSX project fixes
   o small 64bit fixes in nfcdrom
   o aliasing issue fixes (in nfosmesa that is not compiled in)
   o CPU CAS+CAS2 instructions - several very important fixes!
   o some little fixes for newer GCCs in various files
   o RPM spec file updated for Fedora, openSUSE and Mandriva. Give
     rpmbuild -tb aranym_0.9.12.orig.tar.gz a try!

 version 0.9.11 news:

 New features: SCC serial port emulation and USB NatFeat support.
 BeOS/Haiku port: fixes and improvements.
 MMU emulation: fix for initialization and FPU registers.
 Video: fix (refresh palette when switching from true color to bitplane
 mode) and an improvement (use current fullscreen size if fixed size is 0x0).

 version 0.9.10 news:

 New feature: GEM clipboard support that allows you to pass data between
 GEM clipboard and the host one (MS Windows, Mac OS X and X Window System).
 It's currently implemented in FreeMiNT only and uses its aranym.xfs
 virtual filesystem (U:\host\clipbrd). Please see setup instructions
 in http://wiki.aranym.org/gem_clipbrd

 Also couple of important bugfixes:

 o fixed two nasty crashes in HostFS (related to recent symlink fixes)
 o fixed Xcode building universal binaries on PPC
 o VIDEL autozoom feature with correct aspect ratio for non-square pixels

 version 0.9.9 news:

 This time mostly bugfixes:

 o fixed possible crash in HostFS when quitting ARAnyM (not serious)
 o fixed possible crash due to bug in libSDL up to v1.2.13 (very serious)
 o fixed some redrawing problems in 8 and 16 color depths with soft NfVDI
 o fixed all compile time warnings and Categories entry in aranym.desktop
 o fixed weirdness when mouse pointer was leaving the window on Win and OSX
 o fixed problem with invalid HostFS symlink breaking directory list
 o improvement: HostFS symlinks are now shown as relative if possible 
 o fixed indirect descriptors handling in MMU
 o fixed HostFS symlinks for certain path configurations
 o added Mode key in the set of ARAnyM hotkey modifiers
 o fixed Alt+mouse click problem on Mac OSX
 o fixed Right Shift detection upon startup

 If you found ARAnyM crashing previously when moving windows around
 or doing any other activity where VDI had to blit screen areas then
 please upgrade to this version ASAP. We've added a workaround for
 a serious bug in the libSDL that was causing these weird ARAnyM crashes.

 version 0.9.8beta news:

 o CPU: fixed TRAPcc and FTRAPcc instructions (for Guillaume's mplayer :-)
 o VIDEL: pixel precise horizontal scrolling implemented
 o fixed BUSY signal handling on the parallel port
 o fixed mouse grab/ungrab/autograb (see below)
 o added new ARAnyM mouse cursor (white arrow)
 o added middle mouse button handling (in Eiffel mode)
 o added suport for reversing mouse Y-axis in IKBD (used in Linux-m68k)
 o fixed many DSP56001 instructions
 o fixed NFJPEG on 64bit hosts
 o fixed several NF drivers to work under FreeMiNT (not rely on __NF cookie)
 o buggy JIT-FPU was disabled. Now FPU is precise though slower in JIT mode

 Mouse grab/ungrab/autograb has changed: first, ungrabbing when leaving
 ARAnyM window was fixed (issue with autograb on the window border).
 Then, ARAnyM got a new mouse cursor (white one) so you can recognize
 now when the mouse is grabbed (the cursor pointer is black in TOS)
 and when it's not (the cursor pointer is white now).
 At last, mouse autograb upon entering ARAnyM window was disabled until
 we can ensure the Atari mouse cursor is positioned in sync with host
 mouse cursor (will require Atari OS support, probably in a form
 of aranym.acc and AES implementing appl_tplay).
 Also the "AutoGrabMouse" config option has been removed.

  Mostly small fixes at various places plus a lot of work went into
  improving the DSP56001 emulation. Also the sound DMA emulation is
  improved to a point where GSXB driver should be unnecessary.

  o improved automatic network setup on Mac
  o reworked audio DMA emulation. Also added configurable host sound
  frequency
  o one MMU bug fixed (regarding TTR)
  o special support for halting ARAnyM on linux-m68k reboot (--halt)
  o SDL GUI fixed (missing events after alerts)
  o EMULOP is now privileged so if some old ARAnyM TSR starts crashing
  this is why
  o joypads are now emulated
  o joysticks and joypads can be configured in the config file
  o '<>' and 'End' keys' scancodes made Atari compatible

  Check the doc/config example file for the new [JOYSTICKS] and [AUDIO]
  sections.

  Main change: major graphics output overhaul, two video backends - software
  and OpenGL renderer. Faster graphics output on all platforms. Try enabling
  the OpenGL output in the [OPENGL] section of the config file (beware, might
  not work on some platforms, tested on Linux only).
  Massive Mac OS X port improvements: MacIntel supported, fat binaries
  available, JIT working (on x86), networking working, and more.
  o IDE disks now up to 130 GB large (removed 32 GB barrier)

  o MinGW compilable (native MS Windows binary, contrary to Cygwin one)
  o RTC timer on Linux host for more precise MFP timer interrupts
    (if it errors out try running "sudo sysctl -w dev.rtc.max-user-freq=1024")
  o new command line option "--locale CC" where CC is ISO country code
    (example: "--locale DE" will preset NVRAM to german keyboard layout)

Wed Jul 11 00:57:21 CEST 2007 - schwab@suse.de

- Update to aranym 0.9.5beta.
  This version brings major speed up of the MMU version thanks to contribution
  of Roman Zippel and also many improvements for Mac OS X as well as bunch of
  smaller fixes at many places by dedicated ARAnyM developers.
  o OpenGL fixes: mouse cursor, alpha channel on big-endian machines
  o OpenGL is loaded dynamically now (requires SDL 1.2.10 or newer)
  o new project file for Xcode 2.x used to build Universal binaries of MacAranym
  o JITc for Solaris x86
  o MMU translation cache for major speed up of the MMU mode (now almost
    comparable with non-MMU mode - 3 GHz host CPU outperforms 100 MHz 68060!)
  o HostFS symlink fix
  o new TOS patches and VIDEO SETUP dialogs. Most of the settings require
    reboot to take effect.
  o VIDEL refresh was wrong, now fixed and configurable on-the-fly in SETUP
  o TV/VGA switch was wrong, now fixed and configurable in the SETUP
  o small CPU bitfield insn fix, FPU sin/cos fix, VIDEL ST-Shifter fix,
    nfVDI mfdb.fd_stand fix, TOS bconout redir fix...

Sat Dec  2 20:05:41 CET 2006 - schwab@suse.de

- Update to aranym 0.9.4beta2.
  I was so wrong when I wrote "last MMU bugs were fixed" in previous release
  notes. This second beta release fixes several newly found CPU/FPU bugs that
  appeared when ARAnyM became actually used by Debian-m68k people.
  So the linux-m68k kernel as well as other MMU/FPU software should run
  much better now.
  Other news and fixes:
  o optional MIDI output to /dev/sequencer (in [MIDI] try Type=sequencer)
  o ARAnyM shouldn't hang on quit anymore
  o protect2k enabled by default (better HW compatibility with Atari)
  o cxx-exceptions enabled by default (considerably faster in MMU mode)
  o in Cygwin ARAnyM ignores $HOME and follows Windows practice with
    $HOME under Document and Settings/
  o new config file option "GMTime" (set to No by default). When enabled,
    ARAnyM uses Greenwich Mean Time (useful when running an OS that knows
    timezones like something Linux based or maybe even properly configured
    SpareMiNT)
  o linux-m68k properly boots now (with HW initialized)
  o IKBD settings (mouse wheel, AltGr) stored in [IKBD] section of ARAnyM
    config file
  o sound: preliminary locking (XBIOS LockSnd/UnlockSnd) implemented
  o nfVDI: fixed vswr_mode alpha expansions (tested on newsgroup reader Troll)
  o new option in [ETHx]: MAC = aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff for configuring the MAC
    Address of the network interface. You can run several ARAnyMs in a LAN
    now :-)
  For the additions in the ARAnyM config file see the provided commented
  configuration file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 25 11:33:00 CEST 2006 - schwab@suse.de

- Update to aranym 0.9.4beta.
  This release has one major highlight: two last MMU emulation bugs have
  been fixed and ARAnyM now runs Linux-m68k stable for days without any
  single issue. I can now fully recommend ARAnyM for Linux-m68k kernel
  development and also Debian-m68k development. Hoping that it will help
  the m68k linux platform to survive for a little longer.
  There is also a great new feature for those who are tired of setting up
  virtual disk drives for booting to TOS/GEM system: ARAnyM now supports
  bootstrapping directly from host filesystem! You need new versions of
  both EmuTOS and FreeMiNT kernel (with built-in HostFS driver) and
  the following configuration (in the [GLOBAL] section of ARAnyM config file):
    ------ aranym config --------
    Bootstrap = /path/to/mint.prg
    BootstrapArgs = DEBUG_LEVEL=1 BOOT_DELAY=0 MEM_PROT=NO 
    BootDrive = C 
    -----------------------------
  Of course you also need to define the BootDrive (C:) host path in the
  [HOSTFS] config section. FreeMiNT tries to locate the modules and other
  files in usual C:\MINT\ path that is redirected to your host filesystem.
  Other news and fixes:
  o new command line parameter -P (as in Position) will position the ARAnyM
    window to your desired location - enter the coordinates of upper left
    window corner ("-P 50,50") or try to center the window with "-P center".
    This should help especially on MS-Windows where the ARAnyM window often
    ended partially off screen.
  o Host desktop <-> AES clipboard interconnection. Currently for MS-Windows
    only. You need a special FreeMiNT driver that creates a new filesystem
    in FreeMiNT where you can point the AES to store the Clipboard. Find
    more information in documentation at http://wiki.aranym.org/
  o various improvements in graphics area - major speed up for bitplane modes,
    speed up of graphics on Mac OS X, OpenGL alpha mask fix and others.
  o Mac OS X: Swapped meaning of CTRL and META key for Mac OS X back to
    "the logical way": The Apple key(s) represent left and right meta key
    and CTRL key is mapped to Atari CTRL key.
    A new, more Mac like set of keyboard shortcuts defined:
	 Left Apple + , = Open preferences dialog
	 Left Apple + q = Quit
	 Left Apple + r = Reboot
	 Left Apple + escape = Grab/Ungrab mouse cursor
	 Left Apple + d = Enable debugger (if built-in)
	 Left Apple + s = Save screenshot
	 Left Apple + f = Toggle fullscreen mode
  o MS-Windows: corrected/improved window/fullscreen toggle.
  o bug #1521310 fixed: Shifters are now released before the GUI thread
    is started.
  o MIDI now outputs raw data which could be used for mapping the MIDI port
    to host MIDI directly (untested)
  o new compile-time configuration (--enable-protect2k) improves compatibility
    with ST/TT/Falcon where hardware protects first 2 kB of RAM against
    user mode accesses. Enabled by default in MMU build only since it can
    cause some performance degradation.
