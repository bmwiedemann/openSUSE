  <title>Jakarta Commons Daemon Package</title>
  <description>The scope of this package is to define an API in line with the current
Java(tm) Platform APIs to support an alternative invocation mechanism
that could be used instead of the public static void main(String[])
method.  This specification covers the behavior and life cycle of what
is defined as Java(tm) daemons or, in other words, noninteractive
Java(tm) applications.
