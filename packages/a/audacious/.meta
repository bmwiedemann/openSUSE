  <title>Advanced audio player</title>
  <description>Audacious is an advanced audio player. It is free, lightweight, based on GTK+, runs on GNU/Linux and many other UNIX-like platforms, and is focused on audio quality and supporting a wide range of audio codecs.
It still features an alternative skinned user interface (based on Winamp 2.x skins).
Historically, it started as a fork of a fork of XMMS.</description>
