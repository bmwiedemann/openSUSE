  <title>Kana-Kanji Conversion Engine</title>
  <description>Anthy (previously called 'Ancy'):

Canna, FreeWnn, and others are famous Kana-Kanji conversion engines
usable for Unix on PCs. They were originally developed for Japanese
Unix workstations around 1990 and development has practically stopped. 
Therefore, the Heke Project is writing a free conversion engine from
scratch (apart from the dictionary, which is developed outside of the
Heke Project).</description>
