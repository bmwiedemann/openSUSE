  <title>Executes Actions at ACPI Events</title>
  <description>ACPID is a completely flexible, totally extensible daemon for
delivering ACPI events. It listens to a file (/proc/acpi/event) and,
when an event occurs, executes programs to handle the event. The start
script loads all needed modules.

Configure it in /etc/sysconfig/powermanagement.</description>
