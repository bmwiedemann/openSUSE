Thu Dec  9 12:16:46 UTC 2021 - John Paul Adrian Glaubitz <adrian.glaubitz@suse.com>

  * HTTP/2 Message support
    + Support HTTP/2 message type, instead of translating all the
      request to HTTP/2 format
    + BUGFIX: raise proper error when reaching max concurrent stream.
- from version 0.6.9
  * Const added to members, chunked trailer support to HTTP/1, HTTP/2 headers
    + HTTP2/ headers
      - Pseudo headers are pushed into the front of the array list, and other
        than that, it will be treated the same as normal headers
      - Trade off:
        * We know that push front to the array list is expensive. But, it should
          be used only few times, as you don't want to change pseudo headers a
  	  lot and there are at most 4 of them. More than that, we don't need to
  	  do the push front later when we need to send the headers into the wire.
        * The advantage of it is that we will have the mostly the same behavior
          as netty, which is used by Java SDK team already.
        * `add` will push the pseudo header to the front of the list when needed
          (the last header is NOT pseudo header)
    + Chunked trailer
      - Add chunked trailer support to HTTP/1
    + Const changes
      - const added to aws_socket_options
      - const added to aws_http_proxy_options
      - const added to aws_tls_connection_options
- from version 0.6.8
