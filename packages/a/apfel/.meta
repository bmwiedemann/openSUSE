  <title>APFEL: A PDF Evolution Library</title>
  <description>APFEL is able to perform DGLAP evolution up to NNLO in QCD and to LO in QED, both with pole and MSbar masses. The coupled DGLAP QCD+QED evolution equations are solved in x-space by means of higher order interpolations and Runge-Kutta techniques, and allows to explore different options for the treatment of subleading terms.

APFEL provides the user with a graphical interface which performs PDF, luminosity and DIS observables plots in real time, granting an easy access to all the APFEL's functionalities.</description>
