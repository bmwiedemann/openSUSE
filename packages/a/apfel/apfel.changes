Tue Apr 28 09:50:35 UTC 2020 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Add apfel-allow-disabling-pywrap.patch to support building
  without building the python extensions and binaries; build
  python bindings and python-based binaries only for distributions
  supporting python2 since apfel does not support python3.
- Add libtool BuildRequires and run autoreconf since patch touches
  build files.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun 25 09:36:25 UTC 2019 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

  directly call /bin/bash instead.
- Use %%license macro to install the license file.
