- Update to 2.1.0. See https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/changes.html#changes-in-anki-2.1
  for the list of changes.
  * Anki 2.1 uses the same scheduling, syncing and file format as Anki 2.0.x, so you can upgrade and downgrade at will.
  * It’s built with recent support libraries (Python 3.6, Qt 5.9), bringing fixes for crashes, better handling of high resolution displays, non-Latin text, and the latest web standards.
  * It requires a modern system - Windows 7+, OSX 10.10+, or a Linux distro from around 2014+.
  * Add-ons will need to be updated to work with 2.1.
  * Built in MathJax support
  * A "restore backup" option in the profiles screen
  * SVG rendering support for LaTeX
  * Improved add-on configuration, management and updating

Fri Sep 27 14:27:07 UTC 2013 - barendartchuk@suse.com
- updated to 2.0.12
- removed the pyqtconfig workaround patch as the fix has been merged in
  upstream issue #831
- added dependency on python-send2trash
- upstream changes since 2.0.12:
  * The complete list of changes is available at
    http://ankisrs.net/docs/changes.html#changes-in-2.0.12
  * Allow includegraphics in LaTeX
  * You can now view stats on filtered decks.
  * Work around linux crash on paste of invalid image.
- changes since 2.0.10:
  * Default to allowing HTML on import
- changes since 2.0.9:
  * The browser now has a preview button that makes it easier to quickly
    browse previews of cards.
  * If Anki detects that the media is out of sync, it will now automatically
    recover on the next sync. Furthermore, it no longer needs to send files
    that already exist on each side, so when this change is incorporated into
    the mobile clients you’ll be able to copy media over to them to avoid a
    long initial media sync.
  * When media is deleted via a sync or unused media, it’s now placed in the
    OS’s trash folder instead of deleted completely. Likewise for rotated
    backups and
    profile deletions.
  * When notes are deleted, their content is logged in a file called
    deleted.txt
    in your profile folder.
  * Ctrl+Shift+T (Command+Shift+T on a Mac) now jumps to the Tags entry
    field.
  * Allow HTML in Mnemosyne import
  * Workaround a Qt bug that was preventing clicks on the sidebar in the
    browser (thanks to Frostshutz)
  * Pauker importer (thanks to Frostshutz)
  * When using change deck, select the current deck by default.
  * When studying a filtered card, clicking Add will default to that deck.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr  4 06:26:21 UTC 2013 - mvyskocil@opensuse.org

  * Fixed an issue with upgrading some Anki 1 decks.

  * When rescheduling is off in a filtered deck, show "(end)" on buttons that
    will end studying of that card.
  * Fix extra spaces being included when showing tags on card.
  * Make sure we switch back to the previous deck when creation of a filtered
    deck cancelled.
  * Fix a bug that was causing the automatically generated Reading field in the
    Japanese Support add-on to be blanked out again if you clicked directly on
    the Reading field.  and many more, see
  * http://ankisrs.net/docs/changes.html#latest
- drop libqt4-devel dependency hardcoding the qtmajor and qtminor during build
  * anki-remove-pyqtconfig.patch
- drop uneeded anki-indentation.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Nov 17 19:23:27 UTC 2012 - mailaender@opensuse.org 

- update to 2.0.3
  * Fix some more issues with importing content that used a modified version of models already present in your collection. Decks (including 1.2 decks) are now imported in such a way that repeatedly importing them will no longer result in duplicate note types, notes or cards. The duplicate check only works against previous imports made in 2.0.3 however, so if you imported decks with divergent models in a previous Anki 2 version, the first time you import that content again, a duplicate will be created.
  * Fix a few errors that could occur when renaming decks.
  * Fix timeboxing counting one too many cards on the first session and not accounting for undone reviews.
  * Suspended cards now have their due date shown surrounded by brackets in the browser.
  * When a learning card is suspended, it is moved back to new if it was in initial learning, or moved back to a review card if it was in relearning.
  * Fix 1+ day steps not working for relearning cards.
  * Fixed some issues with settings not syncing due to the collection being accidentally marked as modified when it was loaded.
  * Add decimal point to reviews a day statistic.
  * When creating a filtered deck, default to searching through the current deck.
  * Display a progress window when closing the collection, as it may take a while.
  * Fix font size setting in Add Field button.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct 10 12:58:16 UTC 2012 - mvyskocil@suse.com

- update to 2.0.0 
 * Reviews are limited to 100/day by default.
 * When you answer "again", there are now two learning reviews of
   the card, so the red count will increase by two.
 * Cloze deletion has been much improved, but now requires you to
   select a special cloze type (the top left button in the Add window).
 * Selective study is still possible, but is done differently. You
   can either move cards into different decks (via Change Deck in the
   card browser), or create a filtered deck that searches for particular
   tags, card properties and so on.
 * Algorithm for selecting cards in multiple direction is changed
 * Anki only checks the first field to see if it’s unique now.
 * see http://ankisrs.net/docs/dev/changes.html

Sat Nov 19 10:27:44 UTC 2011 - toddrme2178@gmail.com

- Removed unnecessary python-sqlite2 dependency that was preventing
  installation on openSUSE 12.1.  According to the readme this is 
  unneccessary if python 2.5 is used, which all supported openSUSE
  versions have.
- Renamed python-sqlalchemy to python-SQLAlchemy to reflect changed
  package name
- Added version requirements for requires and buildrequires, taken
  from the readme
- Changed numpy from requires to recommends, since it adds optional
  features but is not needed for basic functionality
- Added recommends for matplotlib, since the feature numpy supports
  will not work unless matplotlib is also installed
- Added suggests for other optional packages that add functionality
  like audio playback, audio recording, and file conversion.
  These are suggets since many of them are not available in the
  default openSUSE release due to licensing issues
- Fixed permissions for a file (fix for RPMLINT warning)
