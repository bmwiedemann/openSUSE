Tue Dec 27 23:13:22 UTC 2022 - Ferdinand Thiessen <rpm@fthiessen.de>

- Update to version 20221020:
  * Added support for FFH (Fixed Function Hardware) Operation Region
    special context data.
  * Reverted commit "executer/exsystem: Warn about sleeps greater than 10 ms."
    Due to user complaints about valid sleeps greater than 10ms seen
    in some existing machines -- generating lots of warnings.
  * Do not touch VGA memory when EBDA < 1KiB.
  * Check that EBDA pointer is in valid memory.
  * Completed the existing partial support for the CDAT "table".
  * Updated support for the IORT table - update to version E.e
  * Added CXL 3.0 structures (CXIMS & RDPAS) to the CEDT table
  * iASL: Added CCEL table to both compiler/disassembler.
  * iASL: NHLT table: Fixed compilation of optional undocumented fields
  * iASL: Fix iASL compile error due to ACPI_TDEL_OFFSET.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct 14 13:32:53 UTC 2022 - Thomas Renninger <trenn@suse.de>

- This version includes CEDT table support as requested in feature
  (SLE 15 SP5):
  jsc#PED-201

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 21 21:02:11 UTC 2022 - Ferdinand Thiessen <rpm@fthiessen.de>

- Update bundled wmidump to latest upstream 2021-10-11:
  * Add support for '//' comments
  * Print object_id or notify_id based on ACPI_WMI_EVENT flag
    object_id and notify_id member are in one union. It depends on
    ACPI_WMI_EVENT flag which member is stored in this union.
    So print only one member based on ACPI_WMI_EVENT flag.
- Add comment about origin of the wmidump sources

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr 20 20:02:38 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 20220331:
  For the ASL Sleep() operator, issue a warning if the sleep value is 
  greater than 10 Milliseconds. Quick boottime is important, so warn about 
  sleeps greater than 10 ms. Distribution Linux kernels reach initrd in 350 
  ms, so excessive delays should be called out. 10 ms is chosen randomly, 
  but three of such delays would already make up ten percent of the 
  boottime.

  Namespace: Avoid attempting to walk the Namespace if the Namespace does 
  not exist.

  AML interpreter/iASL compiler: Add new Acpi 6.4 semantics for the 
  LoadTable and Load operators. DDB_HANDLE is gone, now loadtable returns a 
  pass/fail integer. Now load returns a pass/fail integer, as well as 
  storing the return value in an optional 2nd argument.

  Headers: Use uintptr_t and offsetof() in Linux kernel builds. To avoid 
  "performing pointer subtraction with a null pointer has undefined 
  behavior" compiler warnings, use uintptr_t and offsetof() that are always 
  available during Linux kernel builds to define ACPI_UINTPTR_T and the 
  ACPI_TO_INTEGER() and ACPI_OFFSET() macros when building the ACPICA code 
  in the Linux kernel.

  Added support for the Windows 11 _OSI string ("Windows 2021"). Submitted 
  by superm1.

  executer/exsystem: Inform users about ACPI spec violation for the Stall() 
  operator. Values greater than 100 microseconds violate the ACPI 
  specification, so warn users about it. From the ACPI Specification 
  version 6.2 Errata A, 19.6.128 *Stall (Stall for a Short Time)*:
  The implementation of Stall is OS-specific, but must not relinquish
  control of the processor. Because of this, delays longer than 100
  microseconds must use Sleep instead of Stall.

  Data Table Compiler/Disassembler: Add support for the APMT table - ARM 
  Performance Monitoring Unit table. Submitted by @bwicaksononv.

  Data Table Compiler/Disassembler: For MADT, add support for the OEM-
  defined subtables (Types 0x80-0x7F).

  Data Table Compiler: Fixed a problem with support for the SDEV table, 
  where a subtable Length was not computed correctly.

  Data Table Compiler/Disassembler: Add/fix the CFMWS subtable to the CEDT 
  Acpi table support.

  Data Table Compiler/Disassembler: Fix a compile issue with the CEDT and 
  add template. Submitted by MasterDrogo.

  Data Table Compiler/Disassembler: NHLT Changes provided by Piotr Maziarz:
  iASL/NHLT: Rename linux specific structures to DeviceInfo to improve 
  readability of the code.
  iASL/NHLT: Fix parsing undocumented bytes at the end of Endpoint. 
  Undocumented bytes at the end of Endpoint Descriptor can be present 
  independently of Linux-specific structures. Their size can also vary.
  iASL/NHLT: Treat TableTerminator as SpecificConfig. SpecificConfig has 4 
  bytes of size and then an amount of bytes specified by size. All of the 
  terminators that I've seen had a size equal to 4, but theoretically it 
  can vary.

  iASL/AcpiExec: Use _exit instead of exit in signal handers (ctrl-C).

  iASL: Remove a remark due to excessive output. Removed a remark for 
  duplicate Offset() operators, due to a user complaint.

    MTMR. Al Stone.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul 24 21:25:52 UTC 2020 - Matthias Eliasson <elimat@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 20200717 
  ACPICA kernel-resident subsystem:
  * Do not increment OperationRegion reference counts for field units. Recent
    server firmware has revealed that this reference count can overflow on
	large servers that declare many field units (thousands) under the same
	OperationRegion. This occurs because each field unit declaration will add
	a reference count to the source OperationRegion. This release solves the 
	reference count overflow for OperationRegion objects by preventing 
	fieldUnits from incrementing their parent OperationRegion's reference
	count.
  * Replaced one-element arrays with flexible-arrays, which were introduced
    in C99.
  * Restored the readme file containing the directions for generation of
    ACPICA from source on MSVC 2017. Updated the file for MSVC 2017. File is
	located at: generate/msvc2017/readme.txt
  iASL Compiler/Disassembler and ACPICA tools:
  * iASL: Fixed a regression found in version 20200214. Prevent iASL from
    emitting an extra byte of garbage data when control methods declared a
	single parameter type without using braces. This extra byte is known to
	cause a blue screen on the Windows AML interpreter.
  * iASL: Made a change to allow external declarations to specify the type of
    a named object even when some name segments are not defined. This change
	allows the following ASL code to compile 
	(When DEV0 is not defined or not defined yet): 
	External (\_SB.DEV0.OBJ1, IntObj) 
	External (\_SB.DEV0, DeviceObj)
  * iASL: Fixed a problem where method names in "Alias ()" statement could be
    misinterpreted. They are now interpreted correctly as method invocations.
  * iASL: capture a method parameter count (Within the Method info segment,
    as well as the argument node) when using parameter type lists.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul  2 21:45:10 UTC 2020 - Matthias Eliasson <elimat@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 20200528
  ACPICA kernel-resident subsystem:
    Removed old/obsolete Visual Studio files which were used to build the 
    Windows versions of the ACPICA tools. Since we have moved to Visual 
    Studio 2017, we are no longer supporting Visual Studio 2006 and 2009 
    project files. The new subdirectory and solution file are located at:
    acpica/generate/msvc2017/AcpiComponents.sln
  iASL Compiler/Disassembler and ACPICA tools: 
  * iASL: added support for a new OperationRegion Address Space (subtype): 
    PlatformRtMechanism. Support for this new keyword is being released for 
    early prototyping. It will appear in the next release of the ACPI 
    specification.
  * iASL: do not optimize the NameString parameter of the CondRefOf operator. 
    In the previous iASL compiler release, the NameString parameter of the 
    CondRefOf was optimized. There is evidence that some implementations of 
    the AML interpreter do not perform the recursive search-to-parent search 
    during the execution of the CondRefOf operator. Therefore, the CondRefOf 
    operator behaves differently when the NameString parameter is a single 
    name segment (a NameSeg) as opposed to a full NamePath (starting at the 
    root scope) or a NameString containing parent prefixes.
  * iASL: Prevent an inadvertent remark message. This change prevents a 
    remark if within a control method the following exist:
    1) An Operation Region is defined, and
    2) A Field operator is defined that refers to the region.
    This happens because at the top level, the Field operator does not 
    actually create a new named object, it simply references the operation 
    region.
  * Removed support for the acpinames utility. The acpinames was a simple 
    utility used to populate and display the ACPI namespace without executing 
    any AML code. However, ACPICA now supports executable opcodes outside of 
    control methods. This means that executable AML opcodes such as If and 
    Store opcodes need to be executed during table load. Therefore, acpinames 
    would need to be updated to match the same behavior as the acpiexec 
    utility and since acpiexec can already dump the entire namespace (via the 
    'namespace' command), we no longer have the need to maintain acpinames.
  * In order to dump the contents of the ACPI namepsace using acpiexec, 
    execute the following command from the command line:
    acpiexec -b "n" [aml files]

- Update to version 20190405
iASL: Implemented an enhanced multiple file compilation that combines 
named objects from all input files to a single namespace. With this 
feature, any unresolved external declarations as well as duplicate named 
object declarations can be detected during compilation rather than 
generating errors much later at runtime. The following commands are 
examples that utilize this feature:
    iasl dsdt.asl ssdt.asl
    iasl dsdt.asl ssdt1.asl ssdt2.asl
    iasl dsdt.asl ssdt*.asl
- Adjusted patch:
M acpica-no-compiletime.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 13 19:56:38 UTC 2019 - Matthias Eliasson <elimat@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 20190215 
  Support for ACPI specification version 6.3:
  * Add PCC operation region support for the AML interpreter. This adds PCC
    operation region support in the AML interpreter and a default handler for
    acpiexec. The change also renames the PCC region address space keyword to
    PlatformCommChannel.
  * Support for new predefined methods _NBS, _NCH, _NIC, _NIH, and _NIG.
    These methods provide OSPM with health information and device boot
    status.
  * PDTT: Add TriggerOrder to the PCC Identifier structure. The field value
    defines if the trigger needs to be invoked by OSPM before or at the end
    of kernel crash dump processing/handling operation.
  * SRAT: Add Generic Affinity Structure subtable. This subtable in the SRAT
    is used for describing devices such as heterogeneous processors,
    accelerators, GPUs, and IO devices with integrated compute or DMA
    engines.
  * MADT: Add support for statistical profiling in GICC. Statistical
    profiling extension (SPE) is an architecture-specific feature for ARM.
  * MADT: Add online capable flag. If this bit is set, system hardware
    supports enabling this processor during OS runtime.
  * New Error Disconnect Recover Notification value. There are a number of
    scenarios where system Firmware in collaboration with hardware may
    disconnect one or more devices from the rest of the system for purposes
    of error containment. Firmware can use this new notification value to
    alert OSPM of such a removal.
  * PPTT: New additional fields in Processor Structure Flags. These flags
    provide more information about processor topology.
  * NFIT/Disassembler: Change a field name from "Address Range" to "Region
    Type".
  * HMAT updates: make several existing fields to be reserved as well as
    rename subtable 0 to "memory proximity domain attributes".
  * GTDT: Add support for new GTDT Revision 3. This revision adds information
    for the EL2 timer.
  * iASL: Update the HMAT example template for new fields.
  * iASL: Add support for the new revision of the GTDT (Rev 3).
  ACPICA kernel-resident subsystem:
  * AML Parser: fix the main AML parse loop to correctly skip erroneous
    extended opcodes. AML opcodes come in two lengths: 1-byte opcodes and 2-
    byte extended opcodes. If an error occurs during an AML table load, the
    AML parser will continue loading the table by skipping the offending
    opcode. This implements a "load table at any cost" philosophy.
  iASL Compiler/Disassembler and Tools:
  * iASL: Add checks for illegal object references, such as a reference
    outside of method to an object within a method. Such an object is only
    temporary.
  * iASL: Emit error for creation of a zero-length operation region. Such a
    region is rather pointless. If encountered, a runtime error is also
    implemented in the interpeter.
  * Debugger: Fix a possible fault with the "test objects" command.
  * iASL: Makefile: support parent directory filenames containing embedded
    spaces.
  * iASL: Update the TPM2 template to revision 4.
  * iASL: Add the ability to report specific warnings or remarks as errors.
  * Disassembler: Disassemble OEMx tables as actual AML byte code.
    Previously, these tables were treated as "unknown table".
  * iASL: Add definition and disassembly for TPM2 revision 3.
  * iASL: Add support for TPM2 rev 3 compilation.

- Update to 20180629
  Added changelog from mainline, installed into documentation path

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat May 26 09:31:58 UTC 2018 - aloisio@gmx.com

- Update to version 20180508
  ACPICA kernel-resident subsystem:
  * Completed the new (recently deployed) package resolution
    mechanism for the Load and LoadTable ASL/AML operators. This
    fixes a regression that was introduced in version 20180209
    that could result in an AE_AML_INTERNAL exception during the
    loading of a dynamic ACPI/AML table (SSDT) that contains
    package objects.
  iASL Compiler/Disassembler and Tools:
  * AcpiDump and AcpiXtract: Implemented support for ACPI tables
    larger than 1 MB. This change allows for table offsets within
    the acpidump file to be up to 8 characters. These changes are
    backwards compatible with existing acpidump files.
  version 20180427
  ACPICA kernel-resident subsystem:
  * Debugger: Added support for Package objects in the "Test
    Objects" command. This command walks the entire namespace and
    evaluates all named data objects (Integers, Strings, Buffers,
    and now Packages).
  * Improved error messages for the namespace root node.
    Originally, the root was referred to by the confusing string
    "\___". This has been replaced by "Namespace Root" for
    clarification.
  * Fixed a potential infinite loop in the AcpiRsDumpByteList
    function. Colin Ian King <colin.king@canonical.com>.
  iASL Compiler/Disassembler and Tools:
  * iASL: Implemented support to detect and flag illegal forward
    references. For compatibility with other ACPI implementations,
    these references are now illegal at the root level of the DSDT
    or SSDTs. Forward references have always been illegal within
    control methods. This change should not affect existing
    ASL/AML code because of the fact that these references
    have always been illegal in the other ACPI implementation.
  * iASL: Added error messages for the case where a table OEM ID
    and OEM TABLE ID strings are longer than the ACPI-defined length.
    Previously, these strings were simply silently truncated.
  * iASL: Enhanced the -tc option (which creates an AML hex file
    in C, suitable for import into a firmware project):
    1) Create a unique name for the table, to simplify use of
       multiple SSDTs.
    2) Add a protection #ifdef in the file, similar to a .h
       header file. With assistance from Sami Mujawar,
       sami.mujawar@arm.com and Evan Lloyd, evan.lloyd@arm.com
  * AcpiExec: Added a new option, -df, to disable the local
    fault handler. This is useful during debugging, where it may
    be desired to drop into a debugger on a fault.

Sun Dec  6 15:47:00 UTC 2015 - p.drouand@gmail.com

- Update to version 20151124
  * Fixed a possible regression for a previous update to FADT handling. The 
    FADT no longer has a fixed table ID, causing some issues with code that 
    was hardwired to a specific ID. Lv Zheng.
  * Fixed a problem where the method auto-serialization could interfere with 
    the current SyncLevel. This change makes the auto-serialization support 
    transparent to the SyncLevel support and management.
  * Removed support for the _SUB predefined name in AcpiGetObjectInfo. This 
    interface is intended for early access to the namespace during the 
    initial namespace device discovery walk. The _SUB method has been seen to 
    access operation regions in some cases, causing errors because the 
    operation regions are not fully initialized.
  * AML Debugger: Fixed some issues with the terminate/quit/exit commands 
    that can cause faults.
  * AML Debugger: Add thread ID support so that single-step mode only applies 
  * to the AML Debugger thread. This prevents runtime errors within some 
    kernels.
  * Eliminated extraneous warnings from AcpiGetSleepTypeData. Since the _Sx 
    methods that are invoked by this interface are optional, removed warnings 
    emitted for the case where one or more of these methods do not exist. 
    ACPICA BZ 1208.
  * Made a major pass through the entire ACPICA source code base to 
    standardize formatting that has diverged a bit over time. There are no 
    functional changes, but this will of course cause quite a few code 
    differences from the previous ACPICA release.
  * Example Code and Data Size: These are the sizes for the OS-independent 
    acpica.lib produced by the Microsoft Visual C++ 9.0 32-bit compiler. The 
    debug version of the code includes the debug output trace mechanism and 
    has a much larger code and data size.
  * iASL/acpiexec/acpixtract/disassembler: Added support to allow multiple 
    definition blocks within a single ASL file and the resulting AML file. 
    Support for this type of file was also added to the various tools that 
    use binary AML files: acpiexec, acpixtract, and the AML disassembler. The 
    example code below shows two definition blocks within the same file:

    DefinitionBlock ("dsdt.aml", "DSDT", 2, "Intel", "Template", 
0x12345678)
    {
    }
    DefinitionBlock ("", "SSDT", 2, "Intel", "Template", 0xABCDEF01)
    {
    }

  * iASL: Enhanced typechecking for the Name() operator. All expressions for 
    the value of the named object must be reduced/folded to a single constant 
    at compile time, as per the ACPI specification (the AML definition of 
    Name()).
  * iASL: Fixed some code indentation issues for the -ic and -ia options (C 
    and assembly headers). Now all emitted code correctly begins in column 1.
  * iASL: Added an error message for an attempt to open a Scope() on an 
    object defined in an SSDT. The DSDT is always loaded into the namespace 
    first, so any attempt to open a Scope on an SSDT object will fail at 
    runtime.
- Remove acpica_remove_date_macro.patch; fixed on upstream release
