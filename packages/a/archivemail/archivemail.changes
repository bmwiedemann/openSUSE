Fri Nov  9 16:50:43 CET 2007 - poeml@suse.de

- update to 0.7.2
  * fix crash with Python << 2.5, introduced with 0.7.1

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov  9 10:40:45 CET 2007 - poeml@suse.de

- update to 0.7.1
  * Fixed incompatibility with Python 2.5 which broke Maildir handling.
  * Fixed IMAP message flag conversion which was completely broken.
  * Username and password in IMAP URLs can now be double-quoted, so it should be
    no longer a problem if they contain delimiters like the '@' character.
  * New option --copy: archive mail, but don't delete it from the mailbox.
    This is mainly useful for testing purposes, and complements --delete.
  * IMAP: if selecting the mailbox fails, archivemail detects the server's
    mailbox hierarchy delimiter, replaces slashes in the mailbox name with the
    delimiter and tries again.
  * When converting from other formats to mbox, archivemail used to preserve
    existing 'Status' and 'X-Status' mbox headers; these are now silently
    overwritten to ensure they have correct values.
  * Invalid messages/files in Maildirs caused archivemail to silently stop
    processing mails and claim it's all done.  Now skip these and go ahead.
  * The automatic seteuid feature of archivemail is insecure and thus
    deprecated; it will be removed from later versions.
  * archivemail now accepts --days=0

Fri Nov  3 16:47:06 CET 2006 - poeml@suse.de

- update to 0.7.0 (bug numbers below are in the sf.net tracker
  unless indicated otherwise)
  * Fixed long options --filter-append and --pwfile to accept their arguments.
    Closes: #1555935
  * Fixed From_ line generation to actually look for the 'Return-path' and
    'From' headers.  Closes: #1555797
  * Fixed IMAP authentication/URL parsing, which wasn't working at all in
    v0.6.2.  Require username encoded in URL, but be flexible with the password:
    handle both --pwfile and URL-encoded password, and fallback to querying the
    user if neither is present.  Closes: #1555951
  * Convert on-the-wire CRLF to native EOL when saving messages from an IMAP
    folder.  Closes: #1555803
  * Updated man page.  This also addresses #1555951
  * Fixed unittest failure by updating --suffix testcase.  Based on analysis by
    Peter Poeml.  Thanks, Peter.
  * Fixed invalid IMAP filter string for large messages (--size option).
    (Thanks to the anonymous bug reporter)  Closes: #863813
  * Fixed IMAP --dry-run so it doesn't download all messages that would be
    archived.
  * Fixed IMAP --delete which didn't work at all.  (Thanks Anand)
    Closes: Debian bug #203282
  * Terminate each message in newly written mbox with an empty line if the
    message source is not an mbox-format folder.  (Thanks  Chung-chieh Shan)
    Closes: Debian bug #250410
  * Mangle From_ in message body if the message source is not an mbox-format
    folder.  (Thanks Chung-chieh Shan)  Closes: Debian bug #250402
  * Added new option --dont-mangle to turn off From_ mangling.
  * Bumped Python dependency to version 2.3.
  * Fixed unittest TestMboxExclusiveLock which failed on Solaris.  (Thanks Paul
    Rodger)  Closes: #904652
  * Fixed unsafe creation of temporary files in the test suite.
    This addresses Debian bug #385253, and reading the BTS log, it seems this
    issue was assigned CVE-2006-4245, although I cannot find any further
    reference to that CVE.  Note that the bug was initially reported to affect
    archivemail itself, too.  This is not correct.  (Thanks Joey Hess)
    Closes: Debian bug #385253
  * Fixed cleanup of temporary files after test suite failures.
  * Fixed dotlocking race condition.
  * Stats are now working with IMAP.
  * Stats now report the total size of a mailbox and of the archived messages
    therefrom.
  * Always barf if the archive destination directory is world-writable.
  * Distributing man page with the tarball again and fixed distutils setup.
    Closes: #1574720 (Thanks Grant Goodyear)
  * Improved IMAP error reporting

Fri Sep 29 17:36:38 CEST 2006 - poeml@suse.de

- fix build with python 2.5

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun 27 00:00:00 CEST 2006 - poeml@suse.de

- new package (0.6.2)
  * add -F/--filter-append option to append an arbitrary string to the IMAP
    filter string
  * don't delete more than a certain number of messages at a time. The max
    command len is limited. Fixes bug 942403 (Archiving large IMAP folders fails)
  * add SSL support per imaps URL (after patch by Tobias Gruetzmacher)
  * add -P/--pwfile option to supply the IMAP password, so it does not end up in
    the shell history
  * Fix SyntaxWarning: assignment to None (bug #843890)
  * Use the archive cut date rather than the actual time with the --suffix
    option. (Thanks Manuel Estrada Sainz)
