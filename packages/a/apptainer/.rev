    <comment>- Update to version 1.0.3:
  * Process redirects that can come from sregistry with a library:// URL.
  * Fix inspect --deffile and inspect --all to correctly show definition files
    in sandbox container images instead of empty output. This has a side effect
    of also fixing the storing of definition files in the metadata of sif files
    built by Apptainer, because that metadata is constructed by doing inspect
    --all.

    <comment>- Udpated to version 1.1.0-rc2 with following changes:
  * Fixed longstanding bug in the underlay logic when there are nested bind
    points separated by more than one path level, for example /var and
    /var/lib/yum, and the path didn't exist in the container image. The bug
    only caused an error when there was a directory in the container image that
    didn't exist on the host.
  * Improved wildcard matching in the %files directive of build definition
    files by replacing usage of sh with the mvdan.cc library.
  * Replaced checks for compatible filesystem types when using fuse-overlayfs
    with an INFO message when an incompatible filesystem type causes it to be
    unwritable by a fakeroot user.
  * The --nvccli option now works without --fakeroot. In that case the option
    can be used with --writable-tmpfs instead of --writable, and
    --writable-tmpfs is implied if neither option is given. Note that also
    /usr/bin has to be writable by the user, so without --fakeroot that
    probably requires a sandbox image that was built with --fix-perms.
  * The --nvccli option implies --nv.
  * Configure squashfuse to always show files to be owned by the current user.
    That's especially important for fakeroot to prevent most of the files from
    looking like they are owned by user 65534.
  * The fakeroot command can now be used even if $PATH is empty in the
    environment of the apptainer command.
  * Allow the newuidmap command to be missing if the current user is not listed
    in /etc/subuid.
  * Require the uidmap package in Debian packaging.
  * Improved error handling of unsupported pass protected PEM files with
    encrypted containers.
  * Ensure bootstrap_history directory is populated with previous definition
    files, present in source containers used in a build.
  * Add additional options to the build command for testing different fakeroot (forwarded request 998137 from mslacken)</comment>

    <comment>- Udpated to 1.1.2 which fixed CVE-2022-39237
  * CVE-2022-39237: The sif dependency included in Apptainer before this
    release does not verify that the hash algorithm(s) used are
    cryptographically secure when verifying digital signatures. This release
    updates to sif v2.8.1 which corrects this issue. See the linked advisory
    for references and a workaround. (forwarded request 1008777 from mslacken)</comment>

    <time>1676562975</time>
    <user>dimstar_suse</user>
    <comment>- update to 1.1.6 with following changes:
  * Included a fix for CVE-2022-23538 which potentially leaked user credentials
    to a third-party S3 storage service when using the library:// protocol. See
    the https://github.com/sylabs/scs-library-client/security/advisories/GHSA-7p8m-22h4-9pj7  
    for details.
  * Make PS1 environment variable changeable via %environment section on
    definition file that used to be only changeable via APPTAINERENV_PS1
    outside of container. This makes the container's prompt customizable.
  * Fix the passing of nested bind mounts when there are multiple binds
    separated by commas and some of them have colons separating sources and
    destinations.
  * Hide messages about SINGULARITY variables if corresponding APPTAINER
    variables are defined. Fixes a regression introduced in 1.1.4.
  * Print a warning if extra arguments are given to a shell action, and show in
    the run action usage that arguments may be passed.
  * Check for the existence of the runtime executable prefix, to avoid issues
    when running under Slurm's srun. If it doesn't exist, fall back to the
    compile-time prefix.
  * Increase the timeout on image driver (that is, FUSE) mounts from 2 seconds
    to 10 seconds. Instead, print an INFO message if it takes more than 2
    seconds.
  * If a remote is defined both globally (i.e. system-wide) and individually,
    change apptainer remote commands to print an info message instead of
    exiting with a fatal error and to give precedence to the individual
    configuration. (forwarded request 1065996 from mslacken)</comment>
