- update to 3.0.0:
  * A major evolution of Ansible Builder's Execution Environment
    definition format, with overall themes of increased flexibility
    and minimizing required manual alterations of generated build
    contexts. New features of the version 3 Execution Environment
    definition include:
    - Use of vanilla RHEL-ish container images instead of
      specially-crafted base and builder images (tested against
      Fedora, CentOS Stream 8/9, UBI9 and others).
    - Injection of custom build steps before and after every build
      stage.
    - Copying arbitrary files from the builder host into the
      generated container build context (which can then be copied
      into intermediate/final container images as needed with
      custom build steps).
    - Declarative bootstrapping of Python, Ansible Core, and
      Ansible Runner (in addition to roles/collections, of course).
    - Inline definition of Python/bindep/role/collection
      requirements in Execution Environment YAML (external files
      also still supported).
    - Customization of final container initialization ENTRYPOINT,
      USER, and CMD (with verified automatic defaults).
    - Dynamic builder image from user-specified base image-
      specifying a builder image is no longer required (or
      allowed).
    - Faster builds due to linear stage inheritance and removal of
      forced OS package upgrades.
    - Numerous bugfixes and minor enhancements... see documentation
      for examples.
  * Breaking Changes
    - The `--squash` argument to `build` now defaults to `off` for
      all container runtimes. This allows build caches to function
      by default for `podman` during development and testing, at
      the cost of more intermediate layers in the resultant image.
      Manually specifying `--squash new` is suggested for CI and
      production builds when using `podman` to minimize the size
      and number of intermediate layers.
    - Forced OS package manager upgrades are no longer performed in
      individual build stages by default. If a full OS package
      upgrade is desired, add a new build directive to
      `prepend_base` under `additional_build_steps` (e.g., `- RUN
      dnf upgrade -y`) to upgrade packages on the base image. The
      upgraded packages will be reflected in all subsequent build
      stages.
