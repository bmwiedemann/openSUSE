-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 21 19:17:57 UTC 2016 - fabian@ritter-vogt.de

- Use a define for the so version and fix -devel requiring the old libappstream3

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep 16 07:45:43 UTC 2016 - alarrosa@suse.com

- Update to version 0.10.0
- Disable stemming support until we have libstemmer packaged.
- Generate libappstream4 packages since AppStream changes the ABI in 0.10.0

Notes:
 * This release breaks API/ABI in order to support multiple metadata sets describing the same
   component (needed for bundling support), moving away from the database as central data store
   and general cleanup.
 * Porting is relatively straightforward, if you were using AsDatabase, you should switch to AsPool
   now (AsDatabase has been a wrapper around AsPool for a while anyway).
 * Many methods became private API with this release, file a bug if you miss anything.
 * The 'categories.xml' file is gone - please account for that if you were reading it directly,
   and consider using AsCategory instead, which offers the same functionality.

Features:
