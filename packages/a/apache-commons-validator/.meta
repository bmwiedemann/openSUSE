  <title>Jakarta Commons Validator</title>
  <description>A common issue when receiving data either electronically or from user
input is verifying the integrity of the data. This work is repetitive
and becomes even more complicated when different sets of validation
rules need to be applied to the same set of data based, for example, on
locale. Error messages may also vary by locale. This package attempts
to address some of these issues and speed development and maintenance
of validation rules.
