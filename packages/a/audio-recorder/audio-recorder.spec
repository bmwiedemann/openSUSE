%description
Audio-recorder allows you to record music or audio to
a file. It can record audio from your system's soundcard,
microphones, browsers and webcams. Put simply: if it plays out of
your loudspeakers, you can record it.

It has an advanced timer that can:
* Start, stop or pause recording at a given clock time.
* Start, stop or pause after a time period.
* Stop when the recorded file size exceeds a limit.
* Start recording on voice or sound.
* Stop or pause recording on "silence".

The recording can be automatically controlled by:
* RhythmBox audio player.
* Banshee audio player.
* Amarok and other MPRIS compatible players.
* Skype. It can automatically record all your Skype calls without
  any user interaction.

This program supports several audio (output) formats such as Ogg Vorbis
audio, FLAC, MP3 and WAV.

User can also control the recorder from command line with
--command <arg> option.
