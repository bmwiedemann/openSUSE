  <title>Cross distribution and cross architecture autoyast XML syntax checker</title>
  <description>Developing autoyast XML files for autoinstallation, this checker comes in really handy.
It can compatibility check XML files and validate against all recent released SUSE distributions.
Avoid time consuming fiddling and trial on error approaches.
When you already have valid autoyast configuration files and you want to install more recent distributions, use this tool to verify that your XML syntax is still backward compatible.
Use this validator to make your XML autoyast files more robust and stable before even starting an auto-installation.</description>
