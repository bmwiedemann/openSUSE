  issue with GTest and CMake 3.30

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 11 20:12:22 UTC 2024 - Andreas Stieger <andreas.stieger@gmx.de>

- update to 20240116.2
  * Added absl::NoDestructor<T> to simplify defining static types
    that do not need to be destructed upon program exit.
  * Added configurable verbose logging (also known as VLOG).
  * Added absl::Overload(), which returns a functor that provides
    overloads based on the functors passed to it. (from C++17)
  * Breaking change: AbslHashValue() no longer accepts C-style
    arrays as a parameter.
  * Breaking change: absl::weak_equality and absl::strong_equality
    have been removed

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr  2 13:01:58 UTC 2024 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- split abseil libraries so that libzypp / protobuf doesn't
  require all to be installed (jsc#PED-8153)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar  4 10:30:53 UTC 2024 - Fridrich Strba <fstrba@suse.com>

- Fix broken link to sources
- Fix build for distributions that lack the ldconfig_scriptlets
  macro
- Make the gcc version condition a bit more generic

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Mar  3 06:35:57 UTC 2024 - Andreas Stieger <andreas.stieger@gmx.de>

- update to 20240116.1:
  * Add absl::NoDestructor<T> to simplify defining static types
    that do not need to be destructed upon program exit.
  * Add configurable verbose logging (also known as VLOG).
  * Added absl::Overload(), which returns a functor that provides
    overloads based on the functors passed to it. Note that this
    functionality requires C++17 or newer.
  * Breaking Change: AbslHashValue() no longer accepts C-style
    arrays as a parameter, caller need to wrap C-string literals in
    absl::string_view.
  * Breaking Change: absl::weak_equality and absl::strong_equality
    have been removed. The corresponding std types were removed
    before C++20 was finalized

- update to 20230802.1:
  * Add StdcppWaiter to the end of the list of waiter
    implementations

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep  7 06:49:51 UTC 2023 - Adrian Schröter <adrian@suse.de>

- update to 20230802.0
  What's New:
  * Added the nullability library for designating the expected
    nullability of pointers. Currently these serve as annotations
    only, but it is expected that compilers will one day be able
    to use these annotations for diagnostic purposes.
  * Added the prefetch library as a portable layer for moving data
    into caches before it is read.
  * Abseil's hash tables now detect many more programming errors
    in debug and sanitizer builds.
  * Abseil's synchronization objects now differentiate absolute
    waits (when passed an absl::Time) from relative waits (when
    passed an absl::Duration) when the underlying platform supports
    differentiating these cases. This only makes a difference when
    system clocks are adjusted.
  * Abseil's flag parsing library includes additional methods that
    make it easier to use when another library also expects to be
    able to parse flags.
  * absl::string_view is now available as a smaller target,
    @com_google_absl//absl/strings:string_view, so that users may
    use this library without depending on the much larger
    @com_google_absl//absl/strings target.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug  9 15:18:16 UTC 2023 - Fridrich Strba <fstrba@suse.com>

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr 24 12:12:45 UTC 2023 - Adrian Schröter <adrian@suse.de>

- update to 20230125.2
  What's New:
    The Abseil logging library has been released. This library
    provides facilities for writing short text messages about the
    status of a program to stderr, disk files, or other sinks
    (via an extension API). See the logging library documentation
    for more information.
      An extension point, AbslStringify(), allows user-defined types
    to seamlessly work with Abseil's string formatting functions
    like absl::StrCat() and absl::StrFormat().
      A library for computing CRC32C checksums has been added.
      Floating-point parsing now uses the Eisel-Lemire algorithm,
    which provides a significant speed improvement.
      The flags library now provides suggestions for the closest
    flag(s) in the case of misspelled flags.
      Using CMake to install Abseil now makes the installed artifacts
    (in particular absl/base/options.h) reflect the compiled ABI.

  Breaking Changes:
    Abseil now requires at least C++14 and follows Google's Foundational
    C++ Support Policy. See this table for a list of currently supported
    versions compilers, platforms, and build tools.
      The legacy spellings of the thread annotation macros/functions
    (e.g. GUARDED_BY()) have been removed by default in favor of the
    ABSL_ prefixed versions (e.g. ABSL_GUARDED_BY()) due to clashes with
    other libraries. The compatibility macro ABSL_LEGACY_THREAD_ANNOTATIONS
    can be defined on the compile command-line to temporarily restore these
    spellings, but this compatibility macro will be removed in the future.

  Known Issues
    The Abseil logging library in this release is not a feature-complete
    replacement for glog yet. VLOG and DFATAL are examples of features
    that have not yet been released.

- obsolete Fix-maes-msse41-leaking-into-pkgconfig.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Sep 24 13:47:49 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 20220623.1:
  * minor warning fix

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul 11 14:56:15 UTC 2022 - Bruno Pitrus <brunopitrus@hotmail.com>

- Add Fix-maes-msse41-leaking-into-pkgconfig.patch
  * Do not make programs compiled with abseil require new-ish CPUs (boo#1203379)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jul  3 21:25:15 UTC 2022 - Matthias Eliasson <elimat@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 20220623.0
  What's New:
  * Added absl::AnyInvocable, a move-only function type.
  * Added absl::CordBuffer, a type for buffering data for eventual inclusion an
    absl::Cord, which is useful for writing zero-copy code.
  * Added support for command-line flags of type absl::optional<T>.
  Breaking Changes:
  * CMake builds now use the flag ABSL_BUILD_TESTING (default: OFF) to control
    whether or not unit tests are built.
  * The ABSL_DEPRECATED macro now works with the GCC compiler. GCC users that
    are experiencing new warnings can use -Wno-deprecated-declatations silence
	the warnings or use -Wno-error=deprecated-declarations to see warnings but
	not fail the build.
  * ABSL_CONST_INIT uses the C++20 keyword constinit when available. Some
    compilers are more strict about where this keyword must appear compared to
	the pre-C++20 implementation.
  * Bazel builds now depend on the bazelbuild/bazel-skylib repository.
    See Abseil's WORKSPACE file for an example of how to add this dependency.
  Other:
  * This will be the last release to support C++11. Future releases will require at least C++14.

- Update to LTS version 20210324.1
  * Fixed missing absl::Cleanup
  * Fixed pkgconfig install path
- Dropped upstream merged Correctly-install-pkgconfig.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr 13 18:39:09 UTC 2021 - Ferdinand Thiessen <rpm@fthiessen.de>

- Update to LTS version 20210324.0
  * Breaking: The empty absl::container target has been removed from
     the CMake build. This target had no effect and references to
     this target in user code can safely be removed.
  * New: The cleanup library has been released. This library contains
     the control-flow-construct-like type absl::Cleanup which is used
     for executing a callback on scope exit.
  * New: The numeric library now includes bits.h, a polyfill header
     containing implementations of C++20's bitwise math functions.
  * New: Abseil now installs pkg-config files to make it easier to
     use Abseil with some other build systems.
  * New: Abseil now respects the default CMake installation paths.
     Standard CMake variables like CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX can be used
     to change the installation path.
- Added Correctly-install-pkgconfig.patch from upstream to fix
  installation of pkgconfig files
- Call ldconfig on post and postun

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec 29 12:18:55 UTC 2020 - Matthias Eliasson <elimat@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 20200923.2
  What's New:
  * absl::StatusOr<T> has been released. See our blog
    post for more information.
  * Abseil Flags reflection interfaces have been released.
  * Abseil Flags memory usage has been significantly optimized.
  * Abseil now supports a "hardened" build mode. This build mode enables
    runtime checks that guard against programming errors that may lead
    to security vulnerabilities.
  Notable Fixes:
  * Sanitizer dynamic annotations like AnnotateRWLockCreate that are
    also defined by the compiler sanitizer implementation are no longer
    also defined by Abseil.
  * Sanitizer macros are now prefixed with ABSL_ to avoid naming collisions.
  * Sanitizer usage is now automatically detected and no longer requires
    macros like ADDRESS_SANITIZER to be defined on the command line.
  Breaking Changes:
  * Abseil no longer contains a dynamic_annotations library. Users
    using a supported build system (Bazel or CMake) are unaffected by
    this, but users manually specifying link libraries may get an error
    about a missing linker input.
