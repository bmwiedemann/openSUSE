  <title>The Adaptable IO System (ADIOS)</title>
  <description>The Adaptable IO System (ADIOS) provides a simple, flexible way for
scientists to describe the data in their code that may need to be
written, read, or processed outside of the running simulation. By
providing an external to the code XML file describing the various
elements, their types, and how you wish to process them this run, the
routines in the host code (either Fortran or C) can transparently change
how they process the data.</description>
