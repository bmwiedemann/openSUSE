%description
A community-sourced, machine-readable knowledge base of forensic
artifacts that can be used both as an information source and within
other tools.

Using artifacts in tools just requires reading YAML. (The Python code
in the project is merely used to validate that the artifacts follow
the specification.)

For some background on the artifacts system and how its developers
expect it to be used, see the BlackHat presentation and Youtube video
from the GRR team.

%description validator
Python modules and program to validate the artifact data. It is
possible for programs to directly call these Python modules, but, by
design, said programs should work directly with the YAML files
themselves and not use these Python modules.
