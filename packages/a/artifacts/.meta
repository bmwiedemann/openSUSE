  <title>Digital Forensics Artifact Repository</title>
  <description>A free, community-sourced, machine-readable knowledge base of forensic artifacts that the world can use both as an information source and within other tools.

If you'd like to use the artifacts in your own tools, all you need to be able to do is read YAML. That's it. No other dependencies. The python code in this project is just used to validate all the artifacts to make sure they follow the spec.

The ForensicArtifacts.com artifact repository was forked from the GRR project artifact collection into a stand-alone repository that is not tool-specific. The GRR developers will migrate to using this repository and make contributions here. In addition the ForensicArtifact team will begin backfilling artifacts in the new format from the ForensicArtifacts.com website.

For some background on the artifacts system and how we expect it to be used see this blackhat presentation and youtube video from the GRR team.
