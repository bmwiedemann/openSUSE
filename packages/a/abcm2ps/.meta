  <title>abcm2ps: a program to typeset abc tunes into Postscript</title>
  <description>abcm2ps is a package which converts music tunes from ABC format to
PostScript. Based on abc2ps version 1.2.5, it was developped mainly to print
barock organ scores which have independant voices played on one or many
keyboards and a pedal-board. abcm2ps introduces many extensions to the ABC
language that make it suitable for classical music.
