  <title>Utility similar to &quot;time&quot;, but with repetitions and more statistics</title>
  <description>avgtime works like the &quot;time&quot; command, except it accepts an &quot;-r&quot;
argument to specify repetitions and shows more detailed statistics.

If repetitions are specified, then statistics are computed and shown, like
median, mean, and standard deviation.
