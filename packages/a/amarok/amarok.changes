      (kde#260352)

- VERSION 2.1beta1
  * The collection scanner is now able to be run in batch mode, allowing for
    automated scans of both full and incremental types.  In addition, all
    graphical dependencies have been removed, allowing for headless, remote
    runs of collection scans.  A wiki page detailing how to do this will be
    made available shortly.
  * Covers are shown for iPod collections.
  * Phonon multimedia system can be configured directly from Amarok.
  * Cover art can now be disabled in the collection browser.

    a QPixmap of the given size, or the default if the size argument isn't
    supplied.

    instead of a string. Needed for image downloads.

    Reading Replay Gain tags from MP4 files requires libMP4v2.  Musepack
    (MPC) files are unsupported due to a limitation of TagLib.
  * Amarok urls. Amarok can now load and generate "amarok urls" that allows
    any "view" to be bookmarked and later retrieved. A protocol handler is
