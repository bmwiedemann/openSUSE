- Update to version 1.8.0:
  * Feat: Implemented a usage-based timeout for strongly isolated
    circuits, as specified in proposal 368.
  * Feat: New experimental arti hsc ctor-migrate command line
    invocation for migrating C Tor onion service client keys to the
    Arti keystore.
  * Security: Added Host header validation for non-CONNECT requests
    to HTTP CONNECT port, to prevent adversarial web pages from
    probing the version of Arti and its capabilities.
  * Fix: Arti no longer exits with an error if configured with a
    log file with no directory prefix.
  * Fix: fs-mistrust now has consistent behavior with stat and
    mkdir, which consider "" to be an invalid path, and all of its
    error messages now include the file name that triggered the
    error.
  * For a full changelog see
    /usr/share/doc/packages/arti/CHANGELOG.md
- Update to version 1.7.0:
  * Improved output format from the experimental arti keys
    check-integrity command.
  * Arti now has experimental support for running as a HTTP CONNECT
    proxy.

    single unit, for improved security and efficiency.
  * The restricted-discovery feature is no longer experimental.
  * Added user-facing documentation for the arti hss onion service
    administration tool.

- Update to version 1.1.12~0:

  Arti 1.1.12 continues work on support for running onion services.
  You can now launch an onion service and expect it to run,
  though the user experience leaves a lot to be desired.

  there are a number of [missing security features]
  we will need to develop before we can recommend them
  for actual use.

- Update to version 1.1.11:

  Arti 1.1.11 continues work on support for running onion services.
  Onion services are now working in our testing, and we expect we'll
  have something testable by others in our next release.

  Arti 1.1.11 also increases our MSRV (Minimum Supported Rust Version)
  to 1.70, in accordance with our [MSRV policy].

  ### Onion service development

  - Correct our handling of BEGIN and END messages to bring them
    into conformance with the C Tor implementation and the specification.
    ([#1077], [!1694], [!1738])
  - In our key manager, use macros to define key specifiers, instead of
    repeating the same boilerplate code. ([#1069], [#1093], [!1710],
    [!1733])
  - Refactoring and refinement on the definitions of onion-service-related
    errors. ([!1718], [!1724], [!1750], [!1751], [!1779])
  - Add a "time-store" mechanism for (as correctly as possible) storing and loading
    future timestamps, even in the presence of system clock skew ([!1723], [!1774])
  - Implement a replay-log backend to prevent INTRODUCE replay attacks
    against onion services. ([!1725])
  - Improved encoding for key-denotators in the key manager. ([#1063],
    [#1070], [!1722])
  - Allow a single key to have more than one denotator in its path.
    ([#1112], [!1747])
  - Use an order-preserving-encryption back-end to generate
    monotonically increasing revision counters for onion service
    descriptors.  We do this to ensure a reproducible series of counters
    without leaking our clock skew.  ([#1053], [!1741], [!1744])
  - Deprecate key types for INTRODUCE-based authentication:
    C tor has never implemented this, and we do not plan to implement it
    without additional specification work. ([#1037], [!1749])
  - When establishing an introduction point, send the `intro_dos`
    extension as appropriate. ([#723], [!1740])
  - Added conversion functions and initial persistence support for
    introduction point keys. ([!1756])
  - Start work on introduction point persistence. ([!1755], [!1765]).
  - Revert to our intended configuration format for onion service proxy rules.
    ([#1058], [!1771])

  ### Client features

  - Backend and API code for the "ntor-v3" circuit-extension handshake.
    This handshake adds the ability to send additional options
    from the client to the relay when creating or extending a circuit,
    and will eventually be used to negotiate protocol features like
    RTT-based congestion control and UDP-over-Tor support.
    ([!1720], [!1739])




-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov 13 17:17:23 UTC 2023 - eyadlorenzo@gmail.com

- Update to version 1.1.10:

  Arti 1.1.10 continues work on support for onion services in
  Arti. At last, we can (technically) run as an onion service...
  though not yet in a useful way. (Onion services don't yet recover
  correctly after a restart, outdated keys are not removed, and we
  are missing other important security features.)

  ### Breaking changes in lower-level crates

  - The [`IoErrorExt`] trait in [`tor-basic-utils`] is now
    sealed. ([!1654])
  - The [`Requestable`] trait in [`tor-dirclient`] is now sealed,
    and most of its members are now private. ([!1679])
  - In [`tor-cell`], stream and circuit IDs are now inherently
    non-zero. To represent an ID that might be zero on the wire, we
    now use
    `Option<StreamId>` or `Option<CircId>`. ([#1080], [!1697])
  - In [`tor-cell`], `CREATE2` handshake types are no longer raw
    `u16` values. ([!1703])
  - In [`tor-cert`], `encode_and_sign` now returns an
    `Ed25519EncodedCert` rather than a raw `Vec<u8>`. ([!1702])


  ### Client features

  - Arti can now be configured to listen for connections on
    multiple arbitrary addresses—not just `localhost`. ([!1613])

  ### Key manager

  - The key manager code now has improved support for generating
    keypairs, keys with derived data, and other structures needed for
    onion services. ([!1653])
  - The key manager now encodes whether a key is private or public in its
    file extension. ([!1672])
  - The key manager now disallows path components that could lead
    (under some programming errors) to directory traversal. ([!1661])
  - We can now list keys by path and type; this is important so that
    we can identify disused keys and eventually expire them. ([!1677])
