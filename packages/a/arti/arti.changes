- Update to version 1.1.10:
  
  Arti 1.1.10 continues work on support for onion services in
  Arti. At last, we can (technically) run as an onion service...
  though not yet in a useful way. (Onion services don't yet recover
  correctly after a restart, outdated keys are not removed, and we
  are missing other important security features.)

  ### Breaking changes in lower-level crates

  - The [`IoErrorExt`] trait in [`tor-basic-utils`] is now
    sealed. ([!1654])
  - The [`Requestable`] trait in [`tor-dirclient`] is now sealed,
    and most of its members are now private. ([!1679])
  - In [`tor-cell`], stream and circuit IDs are now inherently
    non-zero. To represent an ID that might be zero on the wire, we
    now use
    `Option<StreamId>` or `Option<CircId>`. ([#1080], [!1697])
  - In [`tor-cell`], `CREATE2` handshake types are no longer raw
    `u16` values. ([!1703])
  - In [`tor-cert`], `encode_and_sign` now returns an
    `Ed25519EncodedCert` rather than a raw `Vec<u8>`. ([!1702])

  
  ### Client features

  - Arti can now be configured to listen for connections on
    multiple arbitrary addressesâ€”not just `localhost`. ([!1613])

  ### Key manager

  - The key manager code now has improved support for generating
    keypairs, keys with derived data, and other structures needed for
    onion services. ([!1653])
  - The key manager now encodes whether a key is private or public in its
    file extension. ([!1672])
  - The key manager now disallows path components that could lead
    (under some programming errors) to directory traversal. ([!1661])
  - We can now list keys by path and type; this is important so that
    we can identify disused keys and eventually expire them. ([!1677])
