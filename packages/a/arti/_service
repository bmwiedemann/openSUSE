        This is a real but theoretical unaligned read. It might happen only on
        Windows and only with a custom global allocator, which we don't do in our
        arti binary. The bad crate is depended on by env-logger.
        This is being discussed by those crates' contributors here:

        As of 28 Nov 2023, all versions of the rsa crate have a variable
        timing attack that can leak private keys.

        We do not use (yet) do any private-key rsa operations in arti:
        we only use it to verify signatures.

        instant is unmaintained.

        The current dependency path is:
        arti -> signal-hook-async-std -> futures-lite -> fastrand -> instant

        The 'signal-hook-async-std' lib hasn't been updated in three years and depends on `futures-lite = "~1"`.
        The latest 'futures-lite' 2.6.0 uses a version of 'fastrand' that does not depend on instant.

        We should consider trying to upstream patches for 'signal-hook-async-std',
        or remove arti's dependence on it.

        paste is unmaintained.

        We depend on it directly in crates like tor-error, tor-persist, tor-config,
        and also transitively, for example via
        futures-rustls -> rustls -> aws-lc-rc -> paste
        and slotmap-careful -> paste.

        In the long run, we should consider replacing it with another crate
        (concat-idents?).
