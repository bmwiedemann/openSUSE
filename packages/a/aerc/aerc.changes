Tue Jan 14 23:37:03 UTC 2025 - Hannes Braun <apple.hannes@gmail.com> - 0.19.0

- Update to upstream version 0.19.0
  * New :redraw command to force a repaint of the screen.
  * New head and tail templates functions for strings.
  * New {{.AccountFrom}} template variable.
  * Replying to all will include the Sender in Cc.
  * Add -b flag to the :view command to open messages in a background tab.
  * AERC_ACCOUNT and AERC_FOLDER are now available in the signature command
    environment.
  * Filters will receive the actual COLUMNS and LINES values.
  * The :forward command now sets the forwarded flag.
  * Forwarded messages can now be searched for and filtered in notmuch and
    maildir.
  * Forwarded messages can be styled differently in the message list.
  * Forwarded messages can be identified with the {{.IsForwarded}} template.
  * The :flag command now sets/unsets/toggle the forwarded tag.
  * The notmuch backend now honors the forwarded flag, setting the "passed" tag.
  * The maildir backend now honors the forwarded/passed flag.
  * Auto-switch projects based on the message subject for the :patch command.
  * New :echo command that prints its arguments with templates resolved.
  * New use-envelope-from option in accounts.conf.
  * Command completion now displays descriptions next to completion items.
  * New completion_description style object in style sets used for rendering
    completion item descriptions.
  * :import-mbox can now import data from an URL.
  * Dynamic message list style can now match on multiple email headers.
  * The JMAP backend now supports full thread fetching and caching
    (limited within a single mailbox).
  * :expand-folder and :collapse-folder can now act on a non selected folder.
  * Filters commands can now provide their own paging by prefixing them with a
    "!" character. Doing so will disable the configured [viewer].pager and
    connect them directly to the terminal.
  * Reply to addresses in From and Reply-To headers with ":reply -f".
  * Fixed builtin calendar filter showing empty attendee list.
  * Terminal-based pinentry programs (e.g. pinentry-curses) now work properly.
  * Notmuch searches which explicitly contain tags from exclude-tags now return
    messages.
  * Invitations now honor the -a flag for :send.
  * Remove unwanted less than symbol from In-Reply-To header when Message-ID
    uses folding.
  * Aliases are now taken into account correctly when replying to own messages
    such as from the Sent folder or via a mailing list.
  * Some SMTP servers do not strip Bcc headers. aerc now removes them before
    sending emails to avoid leaking private information. A new strip-bcc = false
    option can be used in accounts.conf to revert to previous behaviour
    (preserve Bcc headers in outgoing messages).
  * There should no longer be any duplicates in recipient lists when replying.
  * GPG signatures and encrypted parts now use CRLF line endings as required by
    RFC 5322.
  * Template function quote only prefixes with a space if at quote depth 1.
  * Templates passed to the :reply command using the `-T` flag can now make use
    of {{.OriginalText}}.
  * The location of the command history file has changed to
    ${XDG_STATE_HOME:-$HOME/.local/state}/aerc/history.
  * Tab completions for text fields are run asynchronously. In-flight requests
    are cancelled when new input arrives.
  * Path completion now uses the normal filtering mechanism, respecting case
    sensitivity and the fuzzy completion option.
  * The html filter is now enabled by default, making w3m a weak runtime
    dependency. If it is not installed, viewing HTML emails will fail with an
    explicit error.
  * The default text/html filter will now run w3m in interactive mode.
  * The builtin html and html-unsafe filters can now take additional arguments
    that will be passed to w3m. This can be used to enable inline images when
    viewing text/html parts (e.g.: text/html = ! html-unsafe -sixel).
  * The templates exec commands is now executed with the filters exec $PATH
    similar to filter commands.
  * The default quoted_reply template now converts text/html parts to plain text
    before quoting them.

    backends.

    aerc already running.
  * Prevent a freeze for large-scale deletions with IMAP.

    normalizing header case will not corrupt signatures anymore.
  * Restore previous behaviour of the new message bell which was broken in the

- Update to upstream version 0.16.0
  * JMAP support.
  * The new account wizard now supports all source and outgoing backends.
  * Edit email headers directly in the text editor with "[compose].edit-headers"
    in aerc.conf or with the "-e" flag for all compose related commands (e.g.

    (e.g. with "vim", abort an email with ":cq").

    prepended to the default system "PATH" to avoid conflicts with installed
    distro binaries which have the same name as aerc builtin filters (e.g.
    "/usr/bin/colorize").

    everything, as usual.
