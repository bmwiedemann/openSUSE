Thu Sep 28 13:33:30 UTC 2023 - Hannes Braun <apple.hannes@gmail.com> - 0.16.0

- Update to upstream version 0.16.0
  * JMAP support.
  * The new account wizard now supports all source and outgoing backends.
  * Edit email headers directly in the text editor with "[compose].edit-headers"
    in aerc.conf or with the "-e" flag for all compose related commands (e.g.
    ":compose", ":forward", ":recall", etc.).
  * Use ":save -A" to save all the named parts, not just attachments.
  * The "<Backspace>" key can now be bound.
  * "colorize" can style diff chunk function names with "diff_chunk_func".
  * Warn before sending emails with an empty subject with
    "empty-subject-warning" in aerc.conf.
  * IMAP now uses the delimiter advertised by the server.
  * carddav-query utility to use for "address-book-cmd".
  * Folder name mapping with "folder-map" in accounts.conf.
  * Use ":open -d" to automatically delete temporary files.
  * Remove headers from the compose window with ":header -d <name>".
  * ":attach -r <name> <cmd>" to pipe the attachments from a command.
  * New "msglist_gutter" and `msglist_pill` styles for message list scrollbar.
  * New "%f" placeholder to "file-picker-cmd" which expands to a location of a
    temporary file from which selected files will be read instead of the
    standard output.
  * Save drafts in custom folders with ":postpone -t <folder>".
  * View "thread-context" in notmuch backends with ":toggle-thread-context".
  * ":archive" now works on servers using a different delimiter.
  * ":save -a" now works with multiple attachments with the same filename.
  * ":open" uses the attachment extension for temporary files, if possible.
  * Fixed memory leak when using notmuch with threading.
  * Names formatted like "Last Name, First Name" are better supported in
    templates
  * Composing an email is now aborted if the text editor exits with an error
    (e.g. with "vim", abort an email with ":cq").
  * Aerc builtin filters path (usually "/usr/libexec/aerc/filters") is now
    prepended to the default system "PATH" to avoid conflicts with installed
    distro binaries which have the same name as aerc builtin filters (e.g.
    "/usr/bin/colorize").
  * ":export-mbox" only exports marked messages, if any. Otherwise it exports
    everything, as usual.
  * The local hostname is no longer exposed in outgoing "Message-Id" headers by
    default. Legacy behaviour can be restored by setting "send-with-hostname
    = true" in accounts.conf.
  * Aerc now has a default style for most UI elements. The "default" styleset is
    now empty. Existing stylesets will only override the default attributes if
    they are set explicitly. To reset the default style and preserve existing
    stylesets appearance, these two lines must be inserted at the beginning:
    *.default=true
    *.normal=true

  * running commands (like mailto: or mbox:) no longer prints a success message

  * Removed support for [ui:subject...] contextual sections in aerc.conf.
