- Update to upstream version 0.16.0
  * JMAP support.
  * The new account wizard now supports all source and outgoing backends.
  * Edit email headers directly in the text editor with "[compose].edit-headers"
    in aerc.conf or with the "-e" flag for all compose related commands (e.g.

    temporary file from which selected files will be read instead of the
    standard output.

    (e.g. with "vim", abort an email with ":cq").
  * Aerc builtin filters path (usually "/usr/libexec/aerc/filters") is now
    prepended to the default system "PATH" to avoid conflicts with installed
    distro binaries which have the same name as aerc builtin filters (e.g.
    "/usr/bin/colorize").
  * ":export-mbox" only exports marked messages, if any. Otherwise it exports
    everything, as usual.

    now empty. Existing stylesets will only override the default attributes if
    they are set explicitly. To reset the default style and preserve existing
    stylesets appearance, these two lines must be inserted at the beginning:
    *.default=true
    *.normal=true
