- Initial package creation with version 0.14.0
  * View common email envelope headers with ":envelope".
  * Notmuch accounts now support maildir operations: ":copy", ":move", ":mkdir",
    ":rmdir", ":archive" and the "copy-to" option.
  * Display messages from bottom to top with [ui].reverse-msglist-order=true in
    aerc.conf.
  * Display threads from bottom to top with [ui].reverse-thread-order=true in
    aerc.conf.
  * Style search results in the message list with msglist_result.*.
  * Preview messages with their attachments before sending with ":preview".
  * Filter commands now have AERC_FORMAT, AERC_SUBJECT and AERC_FROM
    defined in their environment.
  * Override the subject prefix for replies pattern with subject-re-pattern in
    accounts.conf.
  * Search/filter by absolute and relative date ranges with the "-d" flag.
  * LIST-STATUS and ORDEREDSUBJECT threading extensions support for imap.
  * Built-in wrap filter that does not mess up nested quotes and lists.
  * Write multipart/alternative messages with ":multipart" and commands defined
    in the new [multipart-converters] section of aerc.conf.
  * Close the message viewer before opening the composer with ":reply -c".
  * Attachment indicator in message list flags (by default a, but can be
    changed via [ui].icon-attachment in aerc.conf).
  * Open file picker menu with ":attach -m". The menu must be generated by an
    external command configured via [compose].file-picker-cmd in aerc.conf.
  * Sample stylesets are now installed in $PREFIX/share/aerc/stylesets.
  * The built-in colorize filter now has different themes.
  * pgp-provider now defaults to auto. It will use the system gpg unless
    the internal keyring exists and contains at least one key.
  * Calling ":split" or ":vsplit" without specifying a size, now attempts to use
    the terminal size to determine a useful split-size.
  * ":pipe -m git am -3" on patch series when Message-Id headers have not been
    generated by "git send-email".
  * Overflowing text in header editors while composing can now be scrolled
    horizontally.
  * Removed broken ":set" command.
