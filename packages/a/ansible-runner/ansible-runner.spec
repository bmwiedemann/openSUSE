%description
Ansible Runner is a tool and python library that helps when interfacing with
Ansible directly or as part of another system whether that be through a
container image interface, as a standalone tool, or as a Python module that
can be imported. The goal is to provide a stable and consistent interface
abstraction to Ansible. This allows Ansible to be embedded into other
systems that donâ€™t want to manage the complexities of the interface on
their own (such as CI/CD platforms, Jenkins, or other automated tooling)
