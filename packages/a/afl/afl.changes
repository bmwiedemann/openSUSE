  - Fixed a minor oversight in the insertion strategy for dictionary words.
    Spotted by Andrzej Jackowski.

    are unique to the input file, but not to the "boring" baseline.
  * "Fixed" a getPassName() problem with never versions of clang.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug 25 12:45:55 UTC 2016 - meissner@suse.com

  - Made several other cosmetic adjustments to cycle timing in the wake of the big tweak made in 2.31b.

- Version 2.31b:
  - Changed havoc cycle counts for a marked performance boost, especially
    with -S / -d. See the discussion of FidgetyAFL in:

    https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/afl-users/fOPeb62FZUg

    While this does not implement the approach proposed by the authors of
    the CCS paper, the solution is a result of digging into that research;
    more improvements may follow as I do more experiments and get more
    definitive data.
- Version 2.30b:
  - Made minor improvements to persistent mode to avoid the remote
    possibility of "no instrumentation detected" issues with very low
    instrumentation densities.

    Reported by Jakub Wilk and Daniel Stender.
  - Made persistent mode bitmaps a bit more consistent and adjusted the way
    this is shown in the UI, especially in persistent mode.

  - Made a minor #include fix to llvm_mode. Suggested by Jonathan Metzman.
  - Made cosmetic updates to the docs.

  - Renamed AFL_LD_PRELOAD to AFL_PRELOAD.
- Version 2.25b:
  - Made some cosmetic updates to libdislocator.so, renamed one env
    variable.
- Version 2.24b:
  - Added libdislocator.so, an experimental, abusive allocator. Try
    it out with AFL_LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/libdislocator.so when running
    afl-fuzz.
- Version 2.23b:
  - Improved the stability metric for persistent mode binaries. Problem
    spotted by Kurt Roeckx.
  - Made a related improvement that may bring the metric to 100% for those
    targets.
- Version 2.22b:
  - Mentioned the potential conflicts between MSAN / ASAN and FORTIFY_SOURCE.
    There is no automated check for this, since some distros may implicitly
    set FORTIFY_SOURCE outside of the compiler's argv[].
  - Populated the support for AFL_LD_PRELOAD to all companion tools.
  - Made a change to the handling of ./afl-clang-fast -v. Spotted by
    Jan Kneschke.
