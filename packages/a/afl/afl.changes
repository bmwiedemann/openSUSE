- updated to 4.21c
  * afl-fuzz
    - fixed a regression in afl-fuzz that resulted in a 5-10% performace loss
      do a switch from gettimeofday() to clock_gettime() which should be rather
      three times faster. The reason for this is unknown.
    - new queue selection algorithm based on 2 core years of queue data
      analysis. gives a noticable improvement on coverage although the results
      seem counterintuitive :-)
    - added AFL_DISABLE_REDUNDANT for huge queues
    - added `AFL_NO_SYNC` environment variable that does what you think it does
    - fix AFL_PERSISTENT_RECORD
    - run custom_post_process after standard trimming
    - prevent filenames in the queue that have spaces
    - minor fix for FAST schedules
    - more frequent stats update when syncing (todo: check performance impact)
    - now timing of calibration, trimming and syncing is measured seperately,
      thanks to @eqv!
    - -V timing is now accurately the fuzz time (without syncing), before
      long calibration times and syncing could result in now fuzzing being
      made when the time was already run out until then, thanks to @eqv!
    - fix -n uninstrumented mode when ending fuzzing
    - enhanced the ASAN configuration
    - make afl-fuzz use less memory with cmplog and fix a memleak
  * afl-cc:
    - re-enable i386 support that was accidently disabled
    - fixes for LTO and outdated afl-gcc mode for i386
    - fix COMPCOV split compare for old LLVMs
    - disable xml/curl/g_ string transform functions because we do not check
      for null pointers ... TODO
    - ensure shared memory variables are visible in weird build setups
    - compatability to new LLVM 19 changes
  * afl-cmin
    - work with input files that have a space
  * afl-showmap
    - fix memory leak on shmem testcase usage (thanks to @ndrewh)
    - minor fix to collect coverage -C (thanks to @bet4it)
  * Fixed a shmem mmap bug (that rarely came up on MacOS)
  * libtokencap: script generate_libtoken_dict.sh added by @a-shvedov

Mon Apr 15 09:44:22 UTC 2024 - Marcus Meissner <meissner@suse.com>

- updated to 4.20c
  + A new forkserver communication model is now introduced. afl-fuzz is
    backward compatible to old compiled targets if they are not built
    for CMPLOG/Redqueen, but new compiled targets will not work with
    old afl-fuzz versions!
  + Recompile all targets that are instrumented for CMPLOG/Redqueen!
  - AFL++ now supports up to 4 billion coverage edges, up from 6 million.
  - New compile option: `make PERFORMANCE=1` - this will enable special
    CPU dependent optimizations that make everything more performant - but
    the binaries will likely won't work on different platforms. Also
    enables a faster hasher if the CPU requirements are met.
  - The persistent record feature (see config.h) was expanded to also
    support replay, thanks to @quarta-qti !
  - afl-fuzz:
    - the new deterministic fuzzing feature is now activated by default,
      deactivate with -z. Parameters -d and -D are ignored.
    - small improvements to CMPLOG/redqueen
    - workround for a bug with MOpt -L when used with -M - in the future
      we will either remove or rewrite MOpt.
    - fix for `-t xxx+` feature
    - -e extension option now saves the queue items, crashes, etc. with the
      extension too
    - fixes for trimmming, correct -V time and reading stats on resume by eqv
      thanks a lot!
  - afl-cc:
    - added collision free caller instrumentation to LTO mode. activate with
      `AFL_LLVM_LTO_CALLER=1`. You can set a max depth to go through single
      block functions with `AFL_LLVM_LTO_CALLER_DEPTH` (default 0)
    - fixes for COMPCOV/LAF and most other modules
    - fix for GCC_PLUGIN cmplog that broke on std::strings
  - afl-whatsup:
    - now also displays current average speed
    - small bugfixes
  - Fixes for aflpp custom mutator and standalone tool
  - Minor edits to afl-persistent-config
  - Prevent temporary files being left behind on aborted afl-whatsup
  - More CPU benchmarks added to benchmark/

-------------------------------------------------------------------

      - floating point splitting bug fix by @hexcoder
      - due a bug in LLVM 17 integer splitting is disabled there!
      - when splitting floats was selected, integers were always split as well,
        fixed to require AFL_LLVM_LAF_SPLIT_COMPARES or _ALL as it should
    - dynamic instrumentation filtering for LLVM NATIVE, thanks @Mozilla!
      see utils/dynamic_covfilter/README.md
  - qemu_mode:
    - plugins are now activated by default and a new module is included that
      produces drcov compatible traces for lighthouse/lightkeeper/...
      thanks to @JRomainG to submitting!
  - updated Nyx checkout (fixes a bug) and some QOL
  - updated the custom grammar mutator
  - document afl-cmin does not work on macOS (but afl-cmin.bash does)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Dec 17 12:08:00 UTC 2023 - Marcus Meissner <meissner@suse.com>

- updated to 4.09c
  - afl-fuzz:
    - fixed the new mutation implementation for two bugs
    - added `AFL_FINAL_SYNC` which forces a final fuzzer sync (also for `-F`)
      before terminating.
    - added AFL_IGNORE_SEED_PROBLEMS to skip over seeds that time out instead
      of exiting with an error message
    - allow -S/-M naming up to 50 characters (from 24)
    - CMPLOG:
      - added scale support (-l S)
      - skip unhelpful insertions (u8)
    - added --version and --help command line parameters
    - fixed endless loop when reading malformed dictionaries
    - new custom mutator function: post_run - thanks to yangzao!
  - afl-whatsup:
    - detect instanced that are starting up and show them as such as not dead
    - now also shows coverage reached
    - option -m shows only very relevant stats
    - option -n will not use color in the output
  - instrumentation:
    - fix for a few string compare transform functions for LAF
    - we are instrumenting __cxx internal functions again. this might break
      a few targets, please report if so.
  - frida_mode:
    - fixes support for large map offsets
  - support for AFL_FUZZER_LOOPCOUNT for afl.rs and LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput
  - afl-cmin/afl-cmin.bash: prevent unneeded file errors

  - added benchmark/benchmark.py if you want to see how good your fuzzing
    speed is in comparison to other setups.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug 11 08:06:00 UTC 2023 - Marcus Meissner <meissner@suse.com>

- updated to 4.08c
  - afl-fuzz:
    - new mutation engine: mutations that favor discovery more paths are
      prefered until no new finds for 10 minutes then switching to mutations
      that favor triggering crashes. Modes and switch time can be configured
      with `-P`. Also input mode for the target can be defined with `-a` to
      be `text` or `binary` (defaults to `generic`)
    - new custom mutator that has the new afl++ engine (so it can easily
      incorporated into new custom mutators), and also comes with a standalone
      command line tool! See custom_mutators/aflpp/standalone/
    - display the state of the fuzzing run in the UI :-)
    - fix timeout setting if '+' is used or a session is restarted
    - -l X option to enable base64 transformation solving
    - allow to disable CMPLOG with '-c -' (e.g. afl.rs enforces '-c 0' on
      every instance which is counterproductive).
  - afl-cmin/afl-cmin.bash:
    - fixed a bug inherited from vanilla AFL where a coverage of
      map[123] = 11 would be the same as map[1123] = 1
    - warn on crashing inputs
    - adjust threads if less inputs than threads specified
  - afl-cc:
    - fixed an off-by-one instrumentation of iselect, hurting coverage a bit.
      Thanks to @amykweon for spotting and fixing!
    - @toka fixed a bug in laf-intel signed integer comparison splitting,
      thanks a lot!!
    - more LLVM compatability
  - frida_mode:
    - support for long form instrumentation on x86_x64 and arm64
    - renamed utils/get_symbol_addr.sh to utils/frida_get_symbol_addr.sh
  - qemu_mode:
    - added qemu_mode/utils/qemu_get_symbol_addr.sh

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- updated to 4.07c
  - afl-fuzz:
    - reverse reading the seeds only on restarts (increases performance)
    - new env `AFL_POST_PROCESS_KEEP_ORIGINAL` to keep the orignal
      data before post process on finds (for atnwalk custom mutator)

      loaded libs after forkserver initialization (required by Mozilla)
  - afl-cc:
    - added @responsefile support
    - new env `AFL_LLVM_LTO_SKIPINIT` to support the AFL++ based WASM
      (https://github.com/fgsect/WAFL) project
    - error and print help if afl-clan-lto is used with lto=thin
    - rewrote our PCGUARD pass to be compatible with LLVM 15+ shenanigans,
      requires LLVM 13+ now instead of 10.0.1+
    - fallback to native LLVM PCGUARD if our PCGUARD is unavailable
    - fixed a crash in GCC CMPLOG
  - afl-showmap:
    - added custom mutator post_process and send support
    - add `-I filelist` option, an alternative to `-i in_dir`
  - afl-cmin + afl-cmin.bash:
    - `-T threads` parallel task support, can be a huge speedup!
  - qemu_mode:
    - Persistent mode + QASAN support for ppc32 targets by @worksbutnottested
  - a new grammar custom mutator atnwalk was submitted by @voidptr127 !

- updated to 4.03c
  - Building now gives a build summary what succeeded and what not
  - afl-fuzz:
    - added AFL_NO_STARTUP_CALIBRATION to start fuzzing at once instead
      of calibrating all initial seeds first. Good for large queues
      and long execution times, especially in CIs.
    - default calibration cycles set to 7 from 8, and only add 5 cycles
      to variables queue items instead of 12.
  - afl-cc:
    - fixed off-by-one bug in our pcguard implemenation, thanks for
      @tokatoka for reporting

Tue Jun 28 14:32:52 UTC 2022 - Marcus Meissner <meissner@suse.com>

- updated to 4.01c
  - fixed */build_...sh scripts to work outside of git
  - new custom_mutator: libafl with token fuzzing :)
  - afl-fuzz:
    - when you just want to compile once and set CMPLOG, then just
      set -c 0 to tell afl-fuzz that the fuzzing binary is also for
      CMPLOG.
    - new commandline options -g/G to set min/max length of generated
      fuzz inputs
    - you can set the time for syncing to other fuzzer now with
      AFL_SYNC_TIME
    - reintroduced AFL_PERSISTENT and AFL_DEFER_FORKSRV to allow
      persistent mode and manual forkserver support if these are not
      in the target binary (e.g. are in a shared library)
    - add AFL_EARLY_FORKSERVER to install the forkserver as earliest as
      possible in the target (for afl-gcc-fast/afl-clang-fast/
      afl-clang-lto)
    - "saved timeouts" was wrong information, timeouts are still thrown
      away by default even if they have new coverage (hangs are always
      kept), unless AFL_KEEP_TIMEOUTS are set
    - AFL never implemented auto token inserts (but user token inserts,
      user token overwrite and auto token overwrite), added now!
    - fixed a mutation type in havoc mode

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jun  4 13:26:34 UTC 2022 - Aaron Puchert <aaronpuchert@alice-dsl.net>

- Add llvm14-fix-build.patch: fix build with LLVM 14. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb 23 22:21:07 UTC 2022 - Aaron Puchert <aaronpuchert@alice-dsl.net>

- Fix build with armv7l on Leap: we have afl-llvm-rt-lto{,-32}.o.
- Fix build with ppc64le: we don't seem to have the 32-bit object
  files available there and there is also no gcc-32bit.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 31 12:45:45 UTC 2022 - Marcus Meissner <meissner@suse.com>

- updated to 4.00c

  - complete documentation restructuring, made possible by Google Season
    of Docs :) thank you Jana!
  - we renamed several UI and fuzzer_stat entries to be more precise,
    e.g. "unique crashes" -> "saved crashes", "total paths" ->
    "corpus count", "current path" -> "current item".
    This might need changing custom scripting!
  - Nyx mode (full system emulation with snapshot capability) has been
    added - thanks to @schumilo and @eqv!

    thanks to RICSecLab submitting!
  - if instrumented libaries are dlopen()'ed after the forkserver you
    will now see a crash. Before you would have colliding coverage.
    We changed this to force fixing a broken setup rather then allowing
    ineffective fuzzing.
  - See docs/best_practices.md how to fix such setups.
  - afl-fuzz:
    -   cmplog binaries will need to be recompiled for this version
        (it is better!)
    -   fix a regression introduced in 3.10 that resulted in less
        coverage being detected. thanks to Collin May for reporting!
    -   ensure all spawned targets are killed on exit
    -   added AFL_IGNORE_PROBLEMS, plus checks to identify and abort on
        incorrect LTO usage setups and enhanced the READMEs for better
        information on how to deal with instrumenting libraries
    -   fix -n dumb mode (nobody should use this mode though)
    -   fix stability issue with LTO and cmplog
    -   better banner
    -   more effective cmplog mode

    afl-showmap and other tools.
  - afl-cc:
    -   detect overflow reads on initial input buffer for asan
    -   new cmplog mode (incompatible with older afl++ versions)
    -   support llvm IR select instrumentation for default PCGUARD and LTO
    -   fix for shared linking on MacOS
    -   better selective instrumentation AFL_LLVM_{ALLOW|DENY}LIST
        on filename matching (requires llvm 11 or newer)

    configuration settings for fuzzing, for Linux and Macos.
    thanks to jhertz!
  - added xml, curl & exotic string functions to llvm dictionary feature
  - fix AFL_PRELOAD issues on MacOS
  - removed utils/afl_frida because frida_mode/ is now so much better
  - added uninstall target to makefile (todo: update new readme!)

- updated to 3.13c
  - Note: plot_data switched to relative time from unix time in 3.10
  - frida_mode - new mode that uses frida to fuzz binary-only targets,
    it currently supports persistent mode and cmplog.
    thanks to @WorksButNotTested!
  - create a fuzzing dictionary with the help of CodeQL thanks to
    @microsvuln! see utils/autodict_ql
  - afl-fuzz:
    - added patch by @realmadsci to support @@ as part of command line
      options, e.g. `afl-fuzz ... -- ./target --infile=@@`
    - add recording of previous fuzz attempts for persistent mode
      to allow replay of non-reproducable crashes, see
      AFL_PERSISTENT_RECORD in config.h and docs/envs.h
    - fixed a bug when trimming for stdin targets
    - cmplog -l: default cmplog level is now 2, better efficiency.
      level 3 now performs redqueen on everything. use with care.
    - better fuzzing strategy yield display for enabled options
    - ensure one fuzzer sync per cycle
    - fix afl_custom_queue_new_entry original file name when syncing
      from fuzzers
    - fixed a crash when more than one custom mutator was used together
      with afl_custom_post_process
    - on a crashing seed potentially the wrong input was disabled
    - added AFL_EXIT_ON_SEED_ISSUES env that will exit if a seed in
      -i dir crashes the target or results in a timeout. By default
      afl++ ignores these and uses them for splicing instead.
    - added AFL_EXIT_ON_TIME env that will make afl-fuzz exit fuzzing
      after no new paths have been found for n seconds
    - when AFL_FAST_CAL is set a variable path will now be calibrated
      8 times instead of originally 40. Long calibration is now 20.
    - added AFL_TRY_AFFINITY to try to bind to CPUs but don't error if
      it fails
  - afl-cc:
    - We do not support llvm versions prior 6.0 anymore
    - added thread safe counters to all modes (`AFL_LLVM_THREADSAFE_INST`),
      note that this disables NeverZero counters.
    - Fix for -pie compiled binaries with default afl-clang-fast PCGUARD
    - Leak Sanitizer (AFL_USE_LSAN) added by Joshua Rogers, thanks!
    - Removed InsTrim instrumentation as it is not as good as PCGUARD
    - Removed automatic linking with -lc++ for LTO mode
    - Fixed a crash in llvm dict2file when a strncmp length was -1
    - added --afl-noopt support
  - utils/aflpp_driver:
    - aflpp_qemu_driver_hook fixed to work with qemu_mode
    - aflpp_driver now compiled with -fPIC
  - unicornafl:
    - fix MIPS delay slot caching, thanks @JackGrence
    - fixed aarch64 exit address
    - execution no longer stops at address 0x0
  - updated afl-system-config to support Arch Linux weirdness and increase
    MacOS shared memory
  - updated the grammar custom mutator to the newest version
  - add -d (add dead fuzzer stats) to afl-whatsup
  - added AFL_PRINT_FILENAMES to afl-showmap/cmin to print the
    current filename
  - afl-showmap/cmin will now process queue items in alphabetical order

  - add dependency on `lld`
  - bump llvm-devel up to >= 11.0.0
- fix /usr/bin/env path in afl.cmin scripts
- prevent stripping of runtime objects (fix bug 1184324)

Wed Mar 24 16:30:39 UTC 2021 - Marcus Meissner <meissner@suse.com>

- updated to 3.12c
  - afl-fuzz:
    - added AFL_TARGET_ENV variable to pass extra env vars to the target
      (for things like LD_LIBRARY_PATH)
    - fix map detection, AFL_MAP_SIZE not needed anymore for most cases
    - fix counting favorites (just a display thing)
  - afl-cc:
    - fix cmplog rtn (rare crash and not being able to gather ptr data)
    - fix our own PCGUARD implementation to compile with llvm 10.0.1
    - link runtime not to shared libs
    - ensure shared libraries are properly built and instrumented
    - AFL_LLVM_INSTRUMENT_ALLOW/DENY were not implemented for LTO, added
    - show correct LLVM PCGUARD NATIVE mode when auto switching to it
      and keep fsanitize-coverage-*list=...
      Short mnemnonic NATIVE is now also accepted.
  - qemu_mode (thanks @realmadsci):
    - move AFL_PRELOAD and AFL_USE_QASAN logic inside afl-qemu-trace
    - add AFL_QEMU_CUSTOM_BIN
  - unicorn_mode
    - accidently removed the subfolder from github, re-added
  - added DEFAULT_PERMISSION to config.h for all files created, default
    to 0600

Tue Mar 16 07:43:01 UTC 2021 - Marcus Meissner <meissner@suse.com>

- updated to 3.11c
  - afl-fuzz:
    - better auto detection of map size
    - fix sanitizer settings (bug since 3.10c)
    - fix an off-by-one overwrite in cmplog
    - add non-unicode variants from unicode-looking dictionary entries
    - Rust custom mutator API improvements
    - Imported crash stats painted yellow on resume (only new ones are red)
  - afl-cc:
    - added AFL_NOOPT that will just pass everything to the normal
      gcc/clang compiler without any changes - to pass weird configure
      scripts
    - fixed a crash that can occur with ASAN + CMPLOG together plus
      better support for unicode (thanks to @stbergmann for reporting!)
    - fixed a crash in LAF transform for empty strings
    - handle erroneous setups in which multiple afl-compiler-rt are
      compiled into the target. This now also supports dlopen()
      instrumented libs loaded before the forkserver and even after the
      forkserver is started (then with collisions though)
    - the compiler rt was added also in object building (-c) which
      should have been fixed years ago but somewhere got lost :(
    - Renamed CTX to CALLER, added correct/real CTX implementation to
      CLASSIC
  - qemu_mode:
    - added AFL_QEMU_EXCLUDE_RANGES env by @realmadsci, thanks!
    - if no new/updated checkout is wanted, build with:
      NO_CHECKOUT=1 ./build_qemu_support.sh
    - we no longer perform a "git drop"
  - afl-cmin: support filenames with spaces
- afl-3.0c-fix-paths.patch: refreshed

Tue Dec 15 09:18:09 UTC 2020 - Marcus Meissner <meissner@suse.com>

- updated to 3.0c
  - llvm_mode/ and gcc_plugin/ moved to instrumentation/
  - examples/ renamed to utils/
  - moved libdislocator, libtokencap and qdbi_mode to utils/
  - all compilers combined to afl-cc which emulates the previous ones
  - afl-llvm/gcc-rt.o merged into afl-compiler-rt.o
  - afl-fuzz
    - not specifying -M or -S will now auto-set "-S default"
    - deterministic fuzzing is now disabled by default and can be enabled with
      -D. It is still enabled by default for -M.
    - a new seed selection was implemented that uses weighted randoms based on
      a schedule performance score, which is much better that the previous
      walk the whole queue approach. Select the old mode with -Z (auto enabled
      with -M)
    - Marcel Boehme submitted a patch that improves all AFFast schedules :)
    - the default schedule is now FAST
    - memory limits are now disabled by default, set them with -m if required
    - rpc.statsd support, for stats and charts, by Edznux, thanks a lot!
    - reading testcases from -i now descends into subdirectories
    - allow the -x command line option up to 4 times
    - loaded extras now have a duplication protection
    - If test cases are too large we do a partial read on the maximum
      supported size
    - longer seeds with the same trace information will now be ignored
      for fuzzing but still be used for splicing
    - crashing seeds are now not prohibiting a run anymore but are
      skipped - they are used for splicing, though
    - update MOpt for expanded havoc modes
    - setting the env var AFL_NO_AUTODICT will not load an LTO autodictionary
    - added NO_SPLICING compile option and makefile define
    - added INTROSPECTION make target that writes all mutations to
      out/NAME/introspection.txt
    - print special compile time options used in help output
    - when using -c cmplog, one of the childs was not killed, fixed
    - somewhere we broke -n dumb fuzzing, fixed
    - added afl_custom_describe to the custom mutator API to allow for easy
      mutation reproduction on crashing inputs
  - instrumentation
    - We received an enhanced gcc_plugin module from AdaCore, thank you
      very much!!
    - not overriding -Ox or -fno-unroll-loops anymore
    - we now have our own trace-pc-guard implementation. It is the same as
      -fsanitize-coverage=trace-pc-guard from llvm 12, but: it is a) inline
      and b) works from llvm 10.0.1 + onwards :)
    - new llvm pass: dict2file via AFL_LLVM_DICT2FILE, create afl-fuzz
      -x dictionary of string comparisons found during compilation
    - LTO autodict now also collects interesting cmp comparisons,
      std::string compare + find + ==, bcmp
    - fix crash in dict2file for integers > 64 bit
  - custom mutators
    - added a new custom mutator: symcc -> https://github.com/eurecom-s3/symcc/
    - added a new custom mutator: libfuzzer that integrates libfuzzer mutations
    - Our afl++ Grammar-Mutator is now better integrated into custom_mutators/
    - added INTROSPECTION support for custom modules
    - python fuzz function was not optional, fixed
    - some python mutator speed improvements
  - afl-cmin/afl-cmin.bash now search first in PATH and last in AFL_PATH
  - unicornafl synced with upstream version 1.02 (fixes, better rust bindings)
  - renamed AFL_DEBUG_CHILD_OUTPUT to AFL_DEBUG_CHILD
  - added AFL_CRASH_EXITCODE env variable to treat a child exitcode as crash
- afl-2.63c-fix-paths.patch refreshed to afl-3.0c-fix-paths.patch

       AFL_LLVM_WHITELIST and AFL_LLVM_INSTRUMENT_FILE are deprecated and

Thu Jul  2 09:59:38 UTC 2020 - Marcus Meissner <meissner@suse.com>

- updated to 2.66c
  - renamed blacklist/whitelist to ignorelist/instrumentlist ->
    AFL_LLVM_INSTRUMENT_FILE and AFL_GCC_INSTRUMENT_FILE
  - warn on deprecated environment variables
  - afl-fuzz:
     - -S secondary nodes now only sync from the main node to increase
       performance, the -M main node still syncs from everyone. Added checks
       that ensure exactly one main node is present and warn otherwise
     - Add -D after -S to force a secondary to perform deterministic fuzzing
     - If no main node is present at a sync one secondary node automatically
       becomes a temporary main node until a real main nodes shows up
     - Fixed a mayor performance issue we inherited from AFLfast
     - switched murmur2 hashing and random() for xxh3 and xoshiro256**,
       resulting in an up to 5.5% speed increase
     - Resizing the window does not crash afl-fuzz anymore
     - Ensure that the targets are killed on exit
     - fix/update to MOpt (thanks to arnow117)
     - added MOpt dictionary support from repo
     - added experimental SEEK power schedule. It is EXPLORE with ignoring
       the runtime and less focus on the length of the test case
  - llvm_mode:
    - the default instrumentation is now PCGUARD if the llvm version is >= 7,
      as it is faster and provides better coverage. The original afl
      instrumentation can be set via AFL_LLVM_INSTRUMENT=AFL. This is
      automatically done when the instrument_file list feature is used. 
    - PCGUARD mode is now even better because we made it collision free - plus
      it has a fixed map size, so it is also faster! :)
    - some targets want a ld variant for LD that is not gcc/clang but ld,
      added afl-ld-lto to solve this
    - lowered minimum required llvm version to 3.4 (except LLVMInsTrim, which
      needs 3.8.0)
    - instrument_file list feature now supports wildcards (thanks to sirmc)
    - small change to cmplog to make it work with current llvm 11-dev
    - added AFL_LLVM_LAF_ALL, sets all laf-intel settings
    - LTO instrument_files functionality rewritten, now main, _init etc functions
      need not to be listed anymore
    - fixed crash in compare-transform-pass when strcasecmp/strncasecmp was
      tried to be instrumented with LTO
    - fixed crash in cmplog with LTO
    - enable snapshot lkm also for persistent mode
  - Unicornafl
    - Added powerPC support from unicorn/next
    - rust bindings!
  - CMPLOG/Redqueen now also works for MMAP sharedmem
  - ensure shmem is released on errors
  - we moved radamsa to be a custom mutator in ./custom_mutators/. It is not
    compiled by default anymore.
  - allow running in /tmp (only unsafe with umask 0)
  - persistent mode shared memory testcase handover (instead of via
    files/stdin) - 10-100% performance increase
  - General support for 64 bit PowerPC, RiscV, Sparc etc.
  - fix afl-cmin.bash
  - slightly better performance compilation options for afl++ and targets
  - fixed afl-gcc/afl-as that could break on fast systems reusing pids in
    the same second
  - added lots of dictionaries from oss-fuzz, go-fuzz and Jakub Wilk
  - added former post_library examples to examples/custom_mutators/
  - Dockerfile upgraded to Ubuntu 20.04 Focal and installing llvm 11 and
    gcc 10 so afl-clang-lto can be build

- updated to 2.65c
  - afl-fuzz:
     - AFL_MAP_SIZE was not working correctly
     - better python detection
     - an old, old bug in afl that would show negative stability in rare
       circumstances is now hopefully fixed
     - AFL_POST_LIBRARY was deprecated, use AFL_CUSTOM_MUTATOR_LIBRARY
       instead (see docs/custom_mutators.md)
  - llvm_mode:
     - afl-clang-fast/lto now do not skip single block functions. This
       behaviour can be reactivated with AFL_LLVM_SKIPSINGLEBLOCK
     - if LLVM 11 is installed the posix shm_open+mmap is used and a fixed
       address for the shared memory map is used as this increases the
       fuzzing speed
     - InsTrim now has an LTO version! :-) That is the best and fastest mode!
     - fixes to LTO mode if instrumented edges > MAP_SIZE
     - CTX and NGRAM can now be used together
     - CTX and NGRAM are now also supported in CFG/INSTRIM mode
     - AFL_LLVM_LAF_TRANSFORM_COMPARES could crash, fixed
     - added AFL_LLVM_SKIP_NEVERZERO to skip the never zero coverage counter
       implementation. For targets with few or no loops or heavily called
       functions. Gives a small performance boost.
  - qemu_mode:
    - add information on PIE/PIC load addresses for 32 bit
    - better dependency checks
  - gcc_plugin:
    - better dependency checks
  - unicorn_mode:
    - validate_crash_callback can now count non-crashing inputs as crash as well
    - better submodule handling
  - afl-showmap: fix for -Q mode
  - added examples/afl_network_proxy which allows to fuzz a target over the
    network (not fuzzing tcp/ip services but running afl-fuzz on one system
    and the target being on an embedded device)
  - added examples/afl_untracer which does a binary-only fuzzing with the
    modifications done in memory (intel32/64 and aarch64 support)
  - added examples/afl_proxy which can be easily used to fuzz and instrument
    non-standard things
  - all:
    - forkserver communication now also used for error reporting
    - fix 32 bit build options
    - make clean now leaves qemu-3.1.1.tar.xz and the unicornafl directory
      intact if in a git/svn checkout - unless "deepclean" is used

Sat Apr 18 07:05:42 UTC 2020 - Marcus Meissner <meissner@suse.com>

- updated to 2.64c
  - llvm_mode LTO mode:
    - now requires llvm11 - but compiles all targets! :)
    - autodictionary feature added, enable with `AFL_LLVM_LTO_AUTODICTIONARY`
    - variable map size usage
  - afl-fuzz:
    - variable map size support added (only LTO mode can use this)
    - snapshot feature usage now visible in UI
    - Now setting `-L -1` will enable MOpt in parallel to normal mutation.
      Additionally, this allows to run dictionaries, radamsa and cmplog.
    - fix for cmplog/redqueen mode if stdin was used
    - fix for writing a better plot_data file
  - qemu_mode: fix for persistent mode (which would not terminate or get stuck)
  - compare-transform/AFL_LLVM_LAF_TRANSFORM_COMPARES now transforms also
    static global and local variable comparisons (cannot find all though)
  - extended forkserver: map_size and more information is communicated to
    afl-fuzz (and afl-fuzz acts accordingly)
  - new environment variable: AFL_MAP_SIZE to specify the size of the shared map
  - if AFL_CC/AFL_CXX is set but empty afl compilers did fail, fixed
    (this bug is in vanilla afl too)
  - added NO_PYTHON flag to disable python support when building afl-fuzz
  - more refactoring

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Apr 12 11:04:35 UTC 2020 - Marcus Meissner <meissner@suse.com>

- updated to 2.63c
  - all:
    - big code changes to make afl-fuzz thread-safe so afl-fuzz can spawn
      multiple fuzzing threads in the future or even become a library
    - afl basic tools now report on the environment variables picked up
    - more tools get environment variable usage info in the help output
    - force all output to stdout (some OK/SAY/WARN messages were sent to
      stdout, some to stderr)
    - uninstrumented mode uses an internal forkserver ("fauxserver")
    - now builds with `-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2`
    - drastically reduced number of (de)allocations during fuzzing
  - afl-fuzz:
    - python mutator modules and custom mutator modules now use the same
      interface and hence the API changed
    - AFL_AUTORESUME will resume execution without the need to specify `-i -`
    - added experimental power schedules (-p):
      - mmopt: ignores runtime of queue entries, gives higher weighting to
               the last 5 queue entries
      - rare: puts focus on queue entries that hits rare branches, also ignores
              runtime
  - llvm_mode: 
    - added SNAPSHOT feature (using https://github.com/AFLplusplus/AFL-Snapshot-LKM)
    - added Control Flow Integrity sanitizer (AFL_USE_CFISAN)
    - added AFL_LLVM_INSTRUMENT option to control the instrumentation type
      easier: DEFAULT, CFG (INSTRIM), LTO, CTX, NGRAM-x (x=2-16)
    - made USE_TRACE_PC compile obsolete
  - LTO collision free instrumented added in llvm_mode with afl-clang-lto -
    note that this mode is amazing, but quite some targets won't compile
  - Added llvm_mode NGRAM prev_loc coverage by Adrean Herrera
    (https://github.com/adrianherrera/afl-ngram-pass/), activate by setting
    AFL_LLVM_INSTRUMENT=NGRAM-<value> or AFL_LLVM_NGRAM_SIZE=<value>
  - Added llvm_mode context sensitive branch coverage, activated by setting
    AFL_LLVM_INSTRUMENT=CTX or AFL_LLVM_CTX=1
  - llvm_mode InsTrim mode:
    - removed workaround for bug where paths were not instrumented and
      imported fix by author
    - made skipping 1 block functions an option and is disabled by default,
      set AFL_LLVM_INSTRIM_SKIPSINGLEBLOCK=1 to re-enable this
  - qemu_mode:
    - qemu_mode now uses solely the internal capstone version to fix builds
      on modern Linux distributions
    - QEMU now logs routine arguments for CmpLog when the target is x86
  - afl-tmin:
    - now supports hang mode `-H` to minimize hangs
    - fixed potential afl-tmin missbehavior for targets with multiple hangs
  - Pressing Control-c in afl-cmin did not terminate it for some OS
  - the custom API was rewritten and is now the same for Python and shared
    libraries.
- afl-1.58b-fix-paths.patch moved to
- afl-2.63c-fix-paths.patch: adjust Makefile -> GNUmakefile

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug 25 12:45:55 UTC 2016 - meissner@suse.com

- Version 2.32b:
  - Added a check for AFL_HARDEN combined with AFL_USE_*SAN. Suggested by Hanno Boeck.
  - Made several other cosmetic adjustments to cycle timing in the wake of the big tweak made in 2.31b.

- Version 2.31b:
  - Changed havoc cycle counts for a marked performance boost, especially
    with -S / -d. See the discussion of FidgetyAFL in:

    https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/afl-users/fOPeb62FZUg

    While this does not implement the approach proposed by the authors of
    the CCS paper, the solution is a result of digging into that research;
    more improvements may follow as I do more experiments and get more
    definitive data.
- Version 2.30b:
  - Made minor improvements to persistent mode to avoid the remote
    possibility of "no instrumentation detected" issues with very low
    instrumentation densities.
  - Fixed a minor glitch with a leftover process in persistent mode.
    Reported by Jakub Wilk and Daniel Stender.
  - Made persistent mode bitmaps a bit more consistent and adjusted the way
    this is shown in the UI, especially in persistent mode.

- Version 2.29b:
  - Made a minor #include fix to llvm_mode. Suggested by Jonathan Metzman.
  - Made cosmetic updates to the docs.
- Version 2.28b:
  - Added "life pro tips" to docs/.
  - Moved testcases/_extras/ to dictionaries/ for visibility.
  - Made minor improvements to install scripts.
  - Added an important safety tip.
- Version 2.27b:
  - Added libtokencap, a simple feature to intercept strcmp / memcmp and
    generate dictionary entries that can help extend coverage.
  - Moved libdislocator to its own dir, added README.
  - The demo in experimental/instrumented_cmp is no more.
- Version 2.26b:
  - Made a fix for libdislocator.so to compile on MacOS X.
  - Added support for DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES.
  - Renamed AFL_LD_PRELOAD to AFL_PRELOAD.
- Version 2.25b:
  - Made some cosmetic updates to libdislocator.so, renamed one env
    variable.
- Version 2.24b:
  - Added libdislocator.so, an experimental, abusive allocator. Try
    it out with AFL_LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/libdislocator.so when running
    afl-fuzz.
- Version 2.23b:
  - Improved the stability metric for persistent mode binaries. Problem
    spotted by Kurt Roeckx.
  - Made a related improvement that may bring the metric to 100% for those
    targets.
- Version 2.22b:
  - Mentioned the potential conflicts between MSAN / ASAN and FORTIFY_SOURCE.
    There is no automated check for this, since some distros may implicitly
    set FORTIFY_SOURCE outside of the compiler's argv[].
  - Populated the support for AFL_LD_PRELOAD to all companion tools.
  - Made a change to the handling of ./afl-clang-fast -v. Spotted by
    Jan Kneschke.

  * Added a new benchmarking option, as requested by Kostya 
    Serebryany.
- Changes for 2.07b
  * Added CPU affinity option (-Z) on Linux. With some caution, 
    this can offer a significant (10%+) performance bump and 
    reduce jitter. Proposed by Austin Seipp.
  * Updated afl-gotcpu to use CPU affinity where supported.
  * Fixed confusing CPU_TARGET error messages with QEMU build.
    Spotted by Daniel Komaromy and others.
- Changes for 2.06b
  * Worked around LLVM persistent mode hiccups with -shared code.
    Contributed by Christian Holler.
  * Added __AFL_COMPILER as a convenient way to detect that 
    something is built under afl-gcc / afl-clang / afl-clang-fast 
    and enable custom optimizations in your code. Suggested by 
    Pedro Corte-Real.
  * Upstreamed several minor changes developed by Franjo Ivancic to
    allow AFL to be built as a library. This is fairly use-specific
    and may have relatively little appeal to general audiences.
