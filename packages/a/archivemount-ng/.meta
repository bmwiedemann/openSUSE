  <title>Mount archives as a file system</title>
  <description>Archivemount is a piece of glue code between libarchive and FUSE. It can be
used to mount a (possibly compressed) archive (as in .tar.gz or .zip or .iso)
and use it like an ordinary filesystem.

This version of the package is a fork and continuation of the original
archivemount, with fuse 3 support and bug fixes.</description>
