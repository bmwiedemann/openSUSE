This patch allows you to insert the pattern that you searched last to be
edited. Say for example you wanted to look for "foo_bar", but wrote mistakenly
"foo-bar" instead, then pressing ^W to search and then ^N you will make appear
in your input "foo-bar" from where you can now easily switch "-" to "_".
