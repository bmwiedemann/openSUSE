Update procedure:

Some features of Alpine do not exist in the release tarball but are only
provided as patches (but by the same author..). So when there is a new
release, the out-of-tree patches on the website get updated too.

	version="2.25"
	for i in WrtAcc colortext fancy fillpara fromheader insertpat maildir rules DelText; do
	wget -O- "http://alpine.x10host.com/alpine/patches/alpine-$version/$i.patch.gz" | gzip -cd >"chappa-$i.patch";
	done

These do not necessarily apply cleanly, so they also need to be
quilt-refreshed as needed.

fillpara is known to collide with DelText.
