Update procedure:

Some features of Alpine do not exist in the release tarball but are only
provided as patches (but by the same author..). So when there is a new
release, the OOT patches on the website get updated too.

	for i in WrtAcc colortext fancy fillpara fromheader insertpat maildir rules; do
	wget -O- http://alpine.x10host.com/alpine/patches/alpine-2.22/$i.patch.gz | gzip -cd >chappa-$i.patch;
	done

These do not necessarily apply cleanly, so they also need to be
quilt-refreshed as needed.
