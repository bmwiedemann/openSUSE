I have added support for the Courier/Cyrus/Dovecot file system, read the configuration instructions.

This patch assumes that your INBOX is located at "$HOME/Maildir". This is a
directory which should have three subdirectories "cur", "tmp" and "new". If you
read maildir from another directory in your $HOME directory (e.g. .maildir),
then set the variable maildir-location to reflect this fact (e.g.
maildir-location=.maildir). This is the best way to change the path of the
inbox. Set Inbox Path = #md/INBOX.
