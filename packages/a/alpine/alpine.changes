Tue May 21 13:25:15 UTC 2024 - Reinhard Max <max@suse.com>

- boo#1224533: Add alpine-qsort.patch to fix build with gcc 14.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb 20 10:39:56 UTC 2024 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Use %patch -P N instead of deprecated %patchN.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep  8 22:29:20 UTC 2022 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Disable parallel build, fails to produce a result

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun 10 15:51:07 UTC 2022 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 2.26
  * Alpine is built with password file support by default. If
    Alpine is built with SMIME support and the password file does
    not exist, then Alpine will create it by default and encrypt
    it.
  * In the past, Alpine did not recognize images embedded in an
    HTML file, so now it does and a link to open them is given.
    Additionally, Alpine did not pass these images to an external
    browser for display using the external command; it does so now.
  * Support for code_verifier and code_challenge when generating
    a refresh token and access token in Gmail and Outlook using
    the S256 method and plain method.
  * Changed the redirect_uri scheme for Gmail, as Google is
    deprecating the use of oob. Changed to http://localhost.
    Users are supposed to enter the URL they see in their browser
    in place of the code.
  * Added support to the LDAP attribute "userCertificate";
  * If new mail has arrived when a user is closing a mailbox,
    Alpine will also announce how many new messages have arrived.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 15 10:46:48 UTC 2022 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 2.25.1
  * In the past, Alpine did not recognize images embedded in an
    HTML file, so now it does and a link to open them is given.
  * Support for code_verifier and code_challenge when generating
    a refresh token and access token in Gmail and Outlook using
    the S256 method and plain method.
  * Alpine is modified to not to attempt to continue a draft
    message if the draft folder is empty. (Some servers do not
    allow the Drafts folder to be removed, even when it is
    empty.)
  * Improvements to the screen that allows a user to select the
    client-id when a user attempts to login to a server and more
    than one client-id is available for that server.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov 24 10:11:28 UTC 2021 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Delete chappa-WrtAcc.patch. Under Linux, one can use the Compose
  key feature. (And for Windows, the putty client can provide an
  equivalent Compose key feature.)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Sep 19 12:26:48 UTC 2021 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 2.25
  * New configuration variable VAR_ssl-ciphers that allows users
    to list the ciphers to use when connecting to a SSL
    server.
  * New hidden feature FEAT_enable-delete-before-writing to add
    support for terminals that need lines to be deleted before
    being written.
  * Always follow ‘suppress-asterisks-in-password-prompt’ setting
    in the various password prompts.
  * Fixed a memory corruption when alpine searches for a string
    that is an incomplete utf8 string in a local folder.
  * Fixed: When forwarding a message, replacing an attachment
    might make Alpine re-attach the original attachment.
  * bsc#1189316, CVE-2021-38370: The c-client library parses
    information from an IMAP server during non-authenticated state
    which could lead to denial of service.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May 25 11:44:38 UTC 2021 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

Sun May 16 15:23:42 UTC 2021 - Callum Farmer <gmbr3@opensuse.org>

- Set system mail directory to /var/mail

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan 15 12:04:04 UTC 2021 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 2.24
  * A few crash fixes
  * Implementation of XOAUTH2 for Yahoo! Mail.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct  2 20:43:57 UTC 2020 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 2.23.2
  * Expansion of the configuration screen for XOAUTH2 to include
    username, and tenant.
  * Alpine uses the domain in the From: header of a message
    to generate a message-id and suppresses all information
    about Alpine, version, revision, and time of generation
    of the message-id from this header.
  * Alpine does not generate Sender or X-X-Sender by default by
    enabling [X] Disable Sender as the default.
  * Alpine does not disclose User Agent by default by enabling
    [X] Suppress User Agent by default.
  * When messages are selected, pressing the ';' command to
    broaden or narrow a search, now offers the possibility to
    completely replace the search, and is almost equivalent to
    being a shortcut to "unselect all messages, and select
    again".

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep  7 13:44:51 UTC 2020 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 2.23
  * Fixes bsc#1173281, CVE-2020-14929: Alpine silently proceeds to
    use an insecure connection after a /tls is sent in certain
    circumstances.
  * Implementation of XOAUTH2 authentication support for Outlook.
  * Add support for the OAUTHBEARER authentication method in Gmail.
  * Support for the SASL-IR IMAP extension.
  * Alpine can pass an HTML message to an external web browser,
    by using the "External" command in the ATTACHMENT INDEX
    screen.
- Drop extern.diff (merged)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jun  7 10:48:05 UTC 2020 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Mark license texts as %license.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May  7 20:32:03 UTC 2020 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 2.22
  * Support for XOAUTH2 authentication method in Gmail. 
  * NTLM authentication support with the ntlm library.
  * Added the "/tls1_3" flag for servers that support it.
  * Add the "g" option to the select command that works in IMAP
    servers that implement the X-GM-EXT-1 capability (such as the
    one offered by Gmail).
  * Added "/auth=XYZ" to the way to define a server. This allows
    users to select the method to authenticate to an IMAP, SMTP
    or POP3 server. Examples are /auth=plain, or /auth=gssapi,
    etc.
  * When a message is of type multipart/mixed, and its first part
    is multipart/signed, Alpine will include the text of the
    original message in a reply message, instead of including a
    multipart attachment.
  * Added backward search in the index screen.
  * pico: Add -dict option to Pico, which allows users to choose a
    dictionary when spelling.
- Drop /usr/bin/mailutil, it is not built by default anymore.
- Remove alpine-pinepw.patch (merged upstream)
- Add description files for patches 600-616. These live in a
  separate file because (a) upstream does not offer the description
  as part of the patch file, (b) redownloading the patches would
  nuke any added description due to <a>.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 26 08:33:31 UTC 2019 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Add return-values.diff to unbreak build.

    when bouncing.
  * The complete change list can be viewed by pressing "R"
    in the Alpine main menu.

  * alpine-no-add-needed.patch
  * chappa-ignoresize.patch
  * chappa-unixnullbug.patch
  * pico-stripwhitespace.diff

- Remove timestamp from binary
  alpine-timestamp.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 25 16:59:29 UTC 2015 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 2.20
* Upgrade UW-IMAP to Panda IMAP from github.com/jonabbey/panda-imap
* S/MIME: Add screen to manage certificates.
* S/MIME: Signatures are validated using the user's certificates
  instead of the ones included in the message. Behavior can be
  disabled by disabling the option "Validate Using Certificate
  Store Only" which is enabled by default.
* S/MIME: add the sender certificate to the list of certificates
  in encrypted messages to make it possible for the sender to
  decrypt the message they sent.
* S/MIME: Forwarding a message will include the signed part as part
  of the text and not as a multipart message, just as the reply
  command does.
* Add support to selective expunge through a subcommand of the
  select-apply commands.
* Pico: New subcommand of the search command, allows to reverse the
  direction of search.
* Add /tls1, /tls1_1, /tls1_2 and /dtls1 to the definition of a
  server to use different ways to connect using ssl, for example
  {server.com/tls1} will attempt to connect to server.com at the
  ssl imap port (port 993) and establish a connection using TLSv1.
  These flags can be used in conjunction with the /ssl flag, the
  ssl flag is redundant. Conversely, however, the /ssl flag does
  not imply any of these flags; the /ssl flag means SSLv3 or, if
  not available, SSLv2 in the SSL port.
* Alpine does not attempt to automatically reopen a collection that
  was not opened due to cancellation by the user. Instead, the user
  must try to open it explicitly.
* Experimental: Write the content-type of a message in lowercase,
  as some non-compliant servers do not understand uppercase
  content-type.
* Opening a folder updates recent count in maildrops (this
  already works for other types of folders)
* Pico: Justification works without need of a predefined quote
  string. This allows justification of blocks of text that are
  indented with spaces.
* Decode the name of attachment names, so they can be written as
  part of the description of the part.
* Replace tabs by spaces in From and Subject fields to control for
  size in screen of these fields. Change only in index screen
  display.
- Drop alpine-month_name-utf8.patch (solved differently upstream),

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan 22 11:43:51 UTC 2014 - max@suse.com

- Add alpine-mime-type-workaround.patch:
  Send mime type in lowercase to work around MUAs that can't cope
  with upper case mime type strings in the Content-Type header
  such as the webmailer of GMX.  This is a backport from the
  current development release and will become obsolete with the
  next version upgrade.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep  2 14:07:32 UTC 2013 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 2.11
* Increase encryption of S/MIME encrypted messages.
* Pico: Improvements in justification of paragraphs: lines that
  begin with a quote string, followed by a space were considered
  individual paragraphs, now they are considered part of a paragraph.
* Unix Alpine: Allow local .pinerc file to be a symbolic link.
* Experimental extended support of recognition of UTF-8 in urls
* Added recognition of ws and wss URIs.
* Add ability to color folder names, directory names, and text in
  the FOLDER SCREEN.

  command.
* Foreign characters are decoded correctly in IMAP folders.
* Recognition of proper mime type for docx, xlsx, and pptx files.
* When composing a message, Alpine will create a new thread when
  the subject is erased.
