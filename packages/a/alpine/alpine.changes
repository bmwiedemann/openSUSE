Thu May  7 20:32:03 UTC 2020 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 2.22
  * Support for XOAUTH2 authentication method in Gmail. 
  * NTLM authentication support with the ntlm library.
  * Added the "/tls1_3" flag for servers that support it.
  * Add the "g" option to the select command that works in IMAP
    servers that implement the X-GM-EXT-1 capability (such as the
    one offered by Gmail).
  * Added "/auth=XYZ" to the way to define a server. This allows
    users to select the method to authenticate to an IMAP, SMTP
    or POP3 server. Examples are /auth=plain, or /auth=gssapi,
    etc.
  * When a message is of type multipart/mixed, and its first part
    is multipart/signed, Alpine will include the text of the
    original message in a reply message, instead of including a
    multipart attachment.
  * Added backward search in the index screen.
  * pico: Add -dict option to Pico, which allows users to choose a
    dictionary when spelling.
- Drop /usr/bin/mailutil, it is not built by default anymore.
- Remove alpine-pinepw.patch (merged upstream)
- Add description files for patches 600-616. These live in a
  separate file because (a) upstream does not offer the description
  as part of the patch file, (b) redownloading the patches would
  nuke any added description due to <a>.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 26 08:33:31 UTC 2019 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul  3 23:12:05 UTC 2017 - jengelh@inai.de

-------------------------------------------------------------------

    in the Alpine main menu.

- Remove timestamp from binary
  alpine-timestamp.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 25 16:59:29 UTC 2015 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 2.20
* Upgrade UW-IMAP to Panda IMAP from github.com/jonabbey/panda-imap
* S/MIME: Add screen to manage certificates.
* S/MIME: Signatures are validated using the user's certificates
  instead of the ones included in the message. Behavior can be
  disabled by disabling the option "Validate Using Certificate
  Store Only" which is enabled by default.
* S/MIME: add the sender certificate to the list of certificates
  in encrypted messages to make it possible for the sender to
  decrypt the message they sent.
* S/MIME: Forwarding a message will include the signed part as part
  of the text and not as a multipart message, just as the reply
  command does.
* Add support to selective expunge through a subcommand of the
  select-apply commands.
* Pico: New subcommand of the search command, allows to reverse the
  direction of search.
* Add /tls1, /tls1_1, /tls1_2 and /dtls1 to the definition of a
  server to use different ways to connect using ssl, for example
  {server.com/tls1} will attempt to connect to server.com at the
  ssl imap port (port 993) and establish a connection using TLSv1.
  These flags can be used in conjunction with the /ssl flag, the
  ssl flag is redundant. Conversely, however, the /ssl flag does
  not imply any of these flags; the /ssl flag means SSLv3 or, if
  not available, SSLv2 in the SSL port.
* Alpine does not attempt to automatically reopen a collection that
  was not opened due to cancellation by the user. Instead, the user
  must try to open it explicitly.
* Experimental: Write the content-type of a message in lowercase,
  as some non-compliant servers do not understand uppercase
  content-type.
* Opening a folder updates recent count in maildrops (this
  already works for other types of folders)
* Pico: Justification works without need of a predefined quote
  string. This allows justification of blocks of text that are
  indented with spaces.
* Decode the name of attachment names, so they can be written as
  part of the description of the part.
* Replace tabs by spaces in From and Subject fields to control for
  size in screen of these fields. Change only in index screen
  display.
- Drop alpine-month_name-utf8.patch (solved differently upstream),
  drop alpine-mime-type-workaround.patch (merged upstream)

Mon Mar  3 11:54:13 UTC 2014 - jengelh@inai.de

  their own; expose these in the .spec file

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan 22 11:43:51 UTC 2014 - max@suse.com

- Add alpine-mime-type-workaround.patch:
  Send mime type in lowercase to work around MUAs that can't cope
  with upper case mime type strings in the Content-Type header
  such as the webmailer of GMX.  This is a backport from the
  current development release and will become obsolete with the
  next version upgrade.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep  2 14:07:32 UTC 2013 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 2.11
* Increase encryption of S/MIME encrypted messages.
* Pico: Improvements in justification of paragraphs: lines that
  begin with a quote string, followed by a space were considered
  individual paragraphs, now they are considered part of a paragraph.
* Unix Alpine: Allow local .pinerc file to be a symbolic link.
* Experimental extended support of recognition of UTF-8 in urls
* Added recognition of ws and wss URIs.
* Add ability to color folder names, directory names, and text in
  the FOLDER SCREEN.
* Add the ability to color any token used in the display of the
  INDEX SCREEN.

  command.

* Recognition of proper mime type for docx, xlsx, and pptx files.
