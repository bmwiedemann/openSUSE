- update to 1.4.0:
  For a full list of changes, please refer to the CHANGELOG!
  https://github.com/grafana/alloy/blob/v1.4.0/CHANGELOG.md
  * Security fixes
    - Add quotes to windows service path to prevent path
      interception attack. CVE-2024-8975 (@mattdurham)
  * Breaking changes
    - Some debug metrics for otelcol components have changed.
      (@thampiotr) For example, otelcol.exporter.otlp's
      exporter_sent_spans_ratio_total metric is now
      otelcol_exporter_sent_spans_total.
    - [otelcol.processor.transform] The functions
      convert_sum_to_gauge and convert_gauge_to_sum must now be
      used in the metric context rather than in the datapoint
      context.
      open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib#34567
      (@wildum)
    - Upgrade Beyla from 1.7.0 to 1.8.2. A complete list of changes
      can be found on the Beyla releases page:
      https://github.com/grafana/beyla/releases. (@wildum) It
      contains a few breaking changes for the component beyla.ebpf:
      - renamed metric process.cpu.state to cpu.mode
      - renamed metric beyla_build_info to
        beyla_internal_build_info
  * Features
    - Added Datadog Exporter community component, enabling
      exporting of otel-formatted Metrics and traces to Datadog.
      (@polyrain) (Experimental) Add an otelcol.processor.interval
      component to aggregate metrics and periodically forward the
      latest values to the next component in the pipeline.
  * Enhancements
    - Clustering peer resolution through --cluster.join-addresses
      flag has been improved with more consistent behaviour, better
      error handling and added support for A/AAAA DNS records. If
      necessary, users can temporarily opt out of this new
      behaviour with the --cluster.use-discovery-v1, but this can
      only be used as a temporary measure, since this flag will be
      disabled in future releases. (@thampiotr)
    - Added a new panel to Cluster Overview dashboard to show the
      number of peers seen by each instance in the cluster. This
      can help diagnose cluster split brain issues. (@thampiotr)
    - Updated Snowflake exporter with performance improvements for
      larger environments.  Also added a new panel to track deleted
      tables to the Snowflake mixin. (@Caleb-Hurshman)
    - Add a otelcol.processor.groupbyattrs component to reassociate
      collected metrics that match specified attributes from
      opentelemetry. (@kehindesalaam)
    - Update windows_exporter to v0.27.2. (@jkroepke) The
      smb.enabled_list and smb_client.enabled_list doesn't have any
      effect anymore. All sub-collectors are enabled by default.
  * Bugfixes
    - Fix a bug where the scrape timeout for a Probe resource was
      not applied, overwriting the scrape interval instead.
      (@morremeyer, @stefanandres)
    - Fix a bug where custom components don't always get updated
      when the config is modified in an imported directory.
      (@ante012)
    - Fixed an issue where providing <hostname>:<port> in
      --cluster.join-addresses would only resolve with DNS to a
      single address, instead of using all the available records.
      (@thampiotr)
  * Other
    - Update OTel from v0.105.0 vo v0.108.0: (@wildum)

- update to 1.3.1:
  For a full list of changes, please refer to the CHANGELOG!
  https://github.com/grafana/alloy/blob/v1.3.1/CHANGELOG.md
  * Notable changes:
    - Changed the cluster startup behaviour, reverting to the
      previous logic where a failure to resolve cluster join peers
      results in the node creating its own cluster. This is to
      facilitate the process of bootstrapping a new cluster
      following user feedback (@thampiotr)
    - Fix a memory leak which would occur any time loki.process had
      its configuration reloaded. (@ptodev)

    - Update Public preview remotecfg argument from metadata to
      attributes. (@erikbaranowski)

      heuristic (@marctc)
  * Features
    - Added community components support, enabling community
      members to implement and maintain components. (@wildum)
    - A new otelcol.exporter.debug component for printing OTel
      telemetry from other otelcol components to the console.
      (@BarunKGP)

      starting in large clusters due to short informer sync
      timeout. (@nrwiersma)

      forming a cluster. (@imavroukakis)
    - Fixed a clustering mode issue where a failure to perform

      startup and could lead to potential split-brain issues.
      (@thampiotr)

    - Use Go 1.22.5 for builds. (@mattdurham)

        and otelcol.receiver.jaeger setting max_request_body_size
        default changed from unlimited size to 20MiB. This is due
        to CVE-2024-36129.
  * Breaking changes to non-GA functionality
    - Component otelcol.receiver.vcenter removed
      vcenter.host.network.packet.errors,
      vcenter.host.network.packet.count, and

      allows to control the preferred order of scrape protocols.
      (@thampiotr)

      exist on the remote repo. (@hainenber)
    - Fixed an issue with loki.source.docker where collecting logs
