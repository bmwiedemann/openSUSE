- update to 1.12.0:
  * Breaking changes
    - prometheus.exporter.blackbox, prometheus.exporter.snmp and
      prometheus.exporter.statsd now use the component ID instead
      of the hostname as
    - their instance label in their exported metrics. This is a
      consequence of a bug fix that could lead to missing data when
      using the exporter
    - with clustering. If you would like to retain the previous
      behaviour, you can use discovery.relabel with action =
      "replace" rule to
    - set the instance label to sys.env("HOSTNAME"). (@thampiotr)

      another to configure the maximum length of the statement
      text. (@SimonSerrano)
    - Add truncate stage for loki.process to truncate log entries,
      label values, and structured_metadata values. (@dehaansa)

Fri Oct  3 06:04:19 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- update to 1.11.0:
  Full list of changes:
  https://github.com/grafana/alloy/blob/v1.11.0/CHANGELOG.md#v1110
  * Breaking changes
    - Prometheus dependency had a major version upgrade from
      v2.55.1 to v3.4.2. (@thampiotr)
      - The . pattern in regular expressions in PromQL matches
        newline characters now. With this change a regular
        expressions like .* matches strings that include \n. This
        applies to matchers in queries and relabel configs in
        Prometheus and Loki components.
      - The enable_http2 in prometheus.remote_write component's
        endpoints has been changed to false by default.
        Previously, in Prometheus v2 the remote write http client
        would default to use http2. In order to parallelize
        multiple remote write queues across multiple sockets its
        preferable to not default to http2. If you prefer to use
        http2 for remote write you must now set enable_http2 to
        true in your prometheus.remote_write endpoints
        configuration section.
      - The experimental CLI flag
        --feature.prometheus.metric-validation-scheme has been
        deprecated and has no effect. You can configure the metric
        validation scheme individually for each prometheus.scrape
        component.
      - Log message format has changed for some of the prometheus.*
        components as part of the upgrade to Prometheus v3.
      - The values of the le label of classic histograms and the
        quantile label of summaries are now normalized upon
        ingestion. In previous Alloy versions, that used Prometheus
        v2, the value of these labels depended on the scrape
        protocol (protobuf vs text format) in some situations. This
        led to label values changing based on the scrape protocol.
        E.g. a metric exposed as my_classic_hist{le="1"} would be
        ingested as my_classic_hist{le="1"} via the text format,
        but as my_classic_hist{le="1.0"} via protobuf. This changed
        the identity of the metric and caused problems when
        querying the metric. In current Alloy release, which uses
        Prometheus v3, these label values will always be normalized
        to a float like representation. I.e. the above example will
        always result in my_classic_hist{le="1.0"} being ingested
        into Prometheus, no matter via which protocol. The effect
        of this change is that alerts, recording rules and
        dashboards that directly reference label values as whole
        numbers such as le="1" will stop working.  The recommended
        way to deal with this change is to fix references to
        integer le and quantile label values, but otherwise do
        nothing and accept that some queries that span the
        transition time will produce inaccurate or unexpected
        results.
      See the upstream Prometheus v3 migration guide for more details.
    - prometheus.exporter.windows dependency has been updated to
      v0.31.1. (@dehaansa)
      - There are various renamed metrics and two removed
        collectors (cs, logon).
    - scrape_native_histograms attribute for prometheus.scrape is
      now set to false, whereas in previous versions of Alloy it
      would default to true. This means that it is no longer enough
      to just configure scrape_protocols to start with
      PrometheusProto to scrape native histograms -
      scrape_native_histograms has to be enabled. If
      scrape_native_histograms is enabled, scrape_protocols will
      automatically be configured correctly for you to include
      PrometheusProto. If you configure it explicitly, Alloy will
      validate that PrometheusProto is in the scrape_protocols
      list.
    - Add otel_attrs_to_hec_metadata configuration block to
      otelcol.exporter.splunkhec to match
      otelcol.receiver.splunkhec. (@cgetzen)
    - [otelcol.processor.batch] Two arguments have different
      default values. (@ptodev)
      - send_batch_size is now set to 2000 by default. It used to
        be 8192.
      - send_batch_max_size is now set to 3000 by default. It used
        to be 0.
      - This helps prevent issues with ingestion of batches that
        are too large.
    - OpenTelemetry Collector dependencies upgraded from v0.128.0
      to v0.134.0. (@ptodev)
      - The otelcol.receiver.opencensus component has been
        deprecated and will be removed in a future release, use
        otelcol.receiver.otelp instead.
      - [otelcol.exporter.*] The deprecated blocking argument in
        the sending_queue block has been removed.  Use
        block_on_overflow instead.
      - [otelcol.receiver.kafka, otelcol.exporter.kafka]: Removed
        the broker_addr argument from the aws_msk block.  Also
        removed the SASL/AWS_MSK_IAM authentication mechanism.
      - [otelcol.exporter.splunkhec] The batcher block is
        deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Use the
        queue block instead.
      - [otelcol.exporter.loadbalancing] Use a linear probe to
        decrease variance caused by hash collisions, which was
        causing a non-uniform distribution of loadbalancing.
      - [otelcol.connector.servicegraph] The
        database_name_attribute argument has been removed.
      - [otelcol.connector.spanmetrics] Adds a default maximum
        number of exemplars within the metric export interval.
      - [otelcol.processor.tail_sampling] Add a new
        block_on_overflow config attribute.
  * Features
    - Add the otelcol.receiver.fluentforward receiver to receive
      logs via Fluent Forward Protocol. (@rucciva)
    - Add the prometheus.enrich component to enrich metrics using
      labels from discovery.* components. (@ArkovKonstantin)
    - Add node_filter configuration block to loki.source.podlogs
      component to enable node-based filtering for pod discovery.
      When enabled, only pods running on the specified node will be
      discovered and monitored, significantly reducing API server
      load and network traffic in DaemonSet deployments.
      (@QuentinBisson)
    - (Experimental) Additions to experimental
      database_observability.mysql component:
      - query_sample collector now supports auto-enabling the
        necessary setup_consumers settings (@cristiangreco)
      - query_sample collector is now compatible with mysql less
        than 8.0.28 (@cristiangreco)
      - include server_id label on log entries (@matthewnolf)
      - support receiving targets argument and relabel those to
        include server_id (@matthewnolf)
      - updated the config blocks and documentation
        (@cristiangreco)
    - (Experimental) Additions to experimental
      database_observability.postgres component:
      - add query_tables collector for postgres (@matthewnolf)
      - add cloud_provider.aws configuration that enables
        optionally supplying the ARN of the database under
        observation. The ARN is appended to metric samples as
        labels for easier filtering and grouping of resources.
      - add query_sample collector for postgres (@gaantunes)
      - add schema_table collector for postgres (@fridgepoet)
      - include server_id label on logs and metrics (@matthewnolf)
    - Add otelcol.receiver.googlecloudpubsub community component to
      receive metrics, traces, and logs from Google Cloud Pub/Sub
      subscription. (@eraac)
    - (Experimental) Add a honor_metadata configuration argument to
      the prometheus.scrape component.  When set to true, it will
      propagate metric metadata to downstream components.
    - Add a flag to pyroscope.ebpf alloy configuration to set the
      off-cpu profiling threshold. (@luweglarz)
    - Add encoding.url_encode and encoding.url_decode std lib
      functions. (@kalleep)

- update to 1.9.2:
  * Bugfixes
    - Send profiles concurrently from pyroscope.ebpf. (@korniltsev)
    - Fix the validate command not understanding the livedebugging
      block. (@dehaansa)
    - Fix invalid class names in python profiles obtained with
      pyroscope.ebpf. (@korniltsev)
    - Fixed a bug which prevented non-secret optional secrets to be
      passed in as number arguments. (@ptodev)
    - For CRD-based components (prometheus.operator.*), retry
      initializing informers if the apiserver request fails. This
      rectifies issues where the apiserver is not reachable
      immediately after node restart. (@dehaansa)
  * Other changes
    - Add no-op blocks and attributes to the
      prometheus.exporter.windows component (@ptodev).
      Version 1.9.0 of Alloy removed the msmq block, as well as the
      enable_v2_collector, where_clause, and use_api attributes in
      the service block.
      This made it difficult for users to upgrade, so those
      attributes have now been made a no-op instead of being
      removed.

- update to 1.9.0:
  Breaking changes
  * The prometheus.exporter.windows component has been update to
    version v0.30.6. This update includes a significant rework of
    the exporter and includes some breaking changes. (@dehaansa)
    The msmq and service collectors can no longer be configured
    with a WMI where clause. Any filtering previously done in a
    where clause will need to be done in a prometheus.relabel
    component.
    The service collector no longer provides enable_v2_collector
    and use_api configuration options.
    The mscluster_* and netframework_* collectors are now replaced
    with one mscluster and netframework collector that allows you
    to enable the separate metric groupings individually.
    The teradici_pcoip and vmware_blast collectors have been
    removed from the exporter.
  * The prometheus.exporter.oracledb component now embeds the
    oracledb_exporter from oracle instead of the deprecated
    oracledb_exporter from iamseth for collecting metrics from an
    OracleDB server: (@wildum)
    The arguments username, password, default_metrics, and
    custom_metrics are now supported.
    The previously undocumented argument custom_metrics is now
    expecting a list of paths to custom metrics files.
    The following metrics are no longer available by default:
    oracledb_sessions_activity, oracledb_tablespace_free_bytes
    (Experimental) The enable_context_propagation argument in
    beyla.ebpf has been replaced with the context_propagation
    argument.
  * Set enable_context_propagation to all to get the same behaviour
    as enable_context_propagation being set to true.
  Security
  * CVE-2025-22872: Fix tokenizer incorrectly interpretting tags
    (bsc#1241863).
  * CVE-2025-46327: Fix race condition when checking access
    permissions to the Easy Logging configuration file
    (bsc#1242020).
  Features

    sending queues and otelcol.receiver.filelog file state tracking
    between restarts. (@dehaansa)
  * Add otelcol.exporter.googlecloud community component to export
    metrics, traces, and logs to Google Cloud. (@motoki317)

- update to 1.8.0:
  * Breaking changes
    - Removed open_port and executable_name from top level
      configuration of Beyla component. Removed enabled argument
      from network block. (@marctc)
    - Breaking changes from the OpenTelemetry Collector v0.122
      update: (@wildum)
      - otelcol.exporter.splunkhec: min_size_items and
        max_size_items were replaced by min_size, max_size and
        sizer in the batcher block to allow users to configure the
        size of the batch in a more flexible way.
      - The telemetry level of Otel components is no longer
        configurable. The level argument in the debug_metrics block
        is kept to avoid breaking changes but it is not used
        anymore.
      - otelcol.processor.tailsampling changed the unit of the
        decision timer metric from microseconds to milliseconds.
        (change unit of
        otelcol_processor_tail_sampling_sampling_decision_timer_latency)
      - otelcol.processor.deltatocumulative: rename
        otelcol_deltatocumulative_datapoints_processed to
        otelcol_deltatocumulative_datapoints and remove the metrics
        otelcol_deltatocumulative_streams_evicted,
        otelcol_deltatocumulative_datapoints_dropped and
        otelcol_deltatocumulative_gaps_length.
      - The regex attribute was removed from
        otelcol.processor.k8sattributes. The extract-patterns
        function from otelcol.processor.transform can be used
        instead.
      - The default value of metrics_flush_interval in
        otelcol.connector.servicegraph was changed from 0s to 60s.
      - s3_partition in otelcol.exporter.awss3 was replaced by
        s3_partition_format.
    - (Experimental) prometheus.write.queue metric names changed to
      align better with prometheus standards. (@mattdurham)
  * Features
    - Add otelcol.receiver.awscloudwatch component to receive logs
      from AWS CloudWatch and forward them to other otelcol.*
      components. (@wildum)

      Collector config. (@jharvey10)
    - Replace graph in Alloy UI with a new version that supports
      modules and data flow visualization. (@wildum)
    - Added --cluster.wait-for-size and --cluster.wait-timeout
      flags which allow to specify the minimum cluster size
      required before components that use clustering begin
      processing traffic to ensure adequate cluster capacity is
      available. (@thampiotr)
    - Add trace_printer to beyla.ebpf component to print trace
      information in a specific format. (@marctc)
    - Add support for live debugging and graph in the UI for
      components imported via remotecfg. (@wildum)

- update to 1.7.5:
  * Notable changes:
    - Set zstd as default compression for prometheus.write.queue.
      (@mattdurham)
      Though technically an enhancement this was causing trouble in
      disk io constrained environments. Zstd provides almost double
      the compression with little additional cpu overhead.

      (@thampiotr)
    - Fixed an issue where indexing targets as maps (e.g.
      target["foo"]) or objects (e.g. target.foo) or using them
      with certain standard library functions was resulting in
      expected object or array, got capsule error under some
      circumstances. This could also lead to foreach evaluation
      failed errors when using the foreach configuration block.
      (@thampiotr)
    - Update prometheus.write.queue to reduce memory fragmentation
      and increase sent throughput. (@mattdurham)

      is not supported". (@thampiotr)
    - Enable batching of calls to the appender in
      prometheus.write.queue to reduce lock contention when
      scraping, which will lead to reduced scrape duration.

      configure TLS client behavior as previously documented.
    - Remove encoding and encoding_file_ext from
      otelcol.exporter.awss3 component as it was not wired in to
      the otel component and Alloy does not currently integrate the

- update to 1.4.0:
  For a full list of changes, please refer to the CHANGELOG!
  https://github.com/grafana/alloy/blob/v1.4.0/CHANGELOG.md
  * Security fixes
    - Add quotes to windows service path to prevent path
      interception attack. CVE-2024-8975 (@mattdurham)
  * Breaking changes
    - Some debug metrics for otelcol components have changed.
      (@thampiotr) For example, otelcol.exporter.otlp's
      exporter_sent_spans_ratio_total metric is now
      otelcol_exporter_sent_spans_total.
    - [otelcol.processor.transform] The functions
      convert_sum_to_gauge and convert_gauge_to_sum must now be
      used in the metric context rather than in the datapoint
      context.
      open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib#34567
      (@wildum)
    - Upgrade Beyla from 1.7.0 to 1.8.2. A complete list of changes
      can be found on the Beyla releases page:
      https://github.com/grafana/beyla/releases. (@wildum) It
      contains a few breaking changes for the component beyla.ebpf:
      - renamed metric process.cpu.state to cpu.mode
      - renamed metric beyla_build_info to
        beyla_internal_build_info
  * Features
    - Added Datadog Exporter community component, enabling
      exporting of otel-formatted Metrics and traces to Datadog.
      (@polyrain) (Experimental) Add an otelcol.processor.interval
      component to aggregate metrics and periodically forward the
      latest values to the next component in the pipeline.
  * Enhancements
    - Clustering peer resolution through --cluster.join-addresses
      flag has been improved with more consistent behaviour, better
      error handling and added support for A/AAAA DNS records. If
      necessary, users can temporarily opt out of this new
      behaviour with the --cluster.use-discovery-v1, but this can
      only be used as a temporary measure, since this flag will be
      disabled in future releases. (@thampiotr)
    - Added a new panel to Cluster Overview dashboard to show the
      number of peers seen by each instance in the cluster. This
      can help diagnose cluster split brain issues. (@thampiotr)
    - Updated Snowflake exporter with performance improvements for
      larger environments.  Also added a new panel to track deleted
      tables to the Snowflake mixin. (@Caleb-Hurshman)
    - Add a otelcol.processor.groupbyattrs component to reassociate
      collected metrics that match specified attributes from
      opentelemetry. (@kehindesalaam)
    - Update windows_exporter to v0.27.2. (@jkroepke) The
      smb.enabled_list and smb_client.enabled_list doesn't have any
      effect anymore. All sub-collectors are enabled by default.
  * Bugfixes
    - Fix a bug where the scrape timeout for a Probe resource was
      not applied, overwriting the scrape interval instead.
      (@morremeyer, @stefanandres)
    - Fix a bug where custom components don't always get updated
      when the config is modified in an imported directory.
      (@ante012)
    - Fixed an issue where providing <hostname>:<port> in
      --cluster.join-addresses would only resolve with DNS to a
      single address, instead of using all the available records.
      (@thampiotr)
  * Other
    - Update OTel from v0.105.0 vo v0.108.0: (@wildum)

- update to 1.3.1:
  For a full list of changes, please refer to the CHANGELOG!
  https://github.com/grafana/alloy/blob/v1.3.1/CHANGELOG.md
  * Notable changes:
    - Changed the cluster startup behaviour, reverting to the
      previous logic where a failure to resolve cluster join peers
      results in the node creating its own cluster. This is to
      facilitate the process of bootstrapping a new cluster
      following user feedback (@thampiotr)
    - Fix a memory leak which would occur any time loki.process had
      its configuration reloaded. (@ptodev)

      members to implement and maintain components. (@wildum)
    - A new otelcol.exporter.debug component for printing OTel
      telemetry from other otelcol components to the console.
