- update to 1.8.0:
  * Breaking changes
    - Removed open_port and executable_name from top level
      configuration of Beyla component. Removed enabled argument
      from network block. (@marctc)
    - Breaking changes from the OpenTelemetry Collector v0.122
      update: (@wildum)
      - otelcol.exporter.splunkhec: min_size_items and
        max_size_items were replaced by min_size, max_size and
        sizer in the batcher block to allow users to configure the
        size of the batch in a more flexible way.
      - The telemetry level of Otel components is no longer
        configurable. The level argument in the debug_metrics block
        is kept to avoid breaking changes but it is not used
        anymore.
      - otelcol.processor.tailsampling changed the unit of the
        decision timer metric from microseconds to milliseconds.
        (change unit of
        otelcol_processor_tail_sampling_sampling_decision_timer_latency)
      - otelcol.processor.deltatocumulative: rename
        otelcol_deltatocumulative_datapoints_processed to
        otelcol_deltatocumulative_datapoints and remove the metrics
        otelcol_deltatocumulative_streams_evicted,
        otelcol_deltatocumulative_datapoints_dropped and
        otelcol_deltatocumulative_gaps_length.
      - The regex attribute was removed from
        otelcol.processor.k8sattributes. The extract-patterns
        function from otelcol.processor.transform can be used
        instead.
      - The default value of metrics_flush_interval in
        otelcol.connector.servicegraph was changed from 0s to 60s.
      - s3_partition in otelcol.exporter.awss3 was replaced by
        s3_partition_format.
    - (Experimental) prometheus.write.queue metric names changed to
      align better with prometheus standards. (@mattdurham)
  * Features
    - Add otelcol.receiver.awscloudwatch component to receive logs
      from AWS CloudWatch and forward them to other otelcol.*
      components. (@wildum)
    - Add loki.enrich component to enrich logs using labels from
      discovery.* components. (@v-zhuravlev)
    - Add string concatenation for secrets type (@ravishankar15)
    - Add support for environment variables to OpenTelemetry
      Collector config. (@jharvey10)
    - Replace graph in Alloy UI with a new version that supports
      modules and data flow visualization. (@wildum)
    - Added --cluster.wait-for-size and --cluster.wait-timeout
      flags which allow to specify the minimum cluster size
      required before components that use clustering begin
      processing traffic to ensure adequate cluster capacity is
      available. (@thampiotr)
    - Add trace_printer to beyla.ebpf component to print trace
      information in a specific format. (@marctc)
    - Add support for live debugging and graph in the UI for
      components imported via remotecfg. (@wildum)

- update to 1.7.5:
  * Notable changes:
    - Set zstd as default compression for prometheus.write.queue.
      (@mattdurham)
      Though technically an enhancement this was causing trouble in
      disk io constrained environments. Zstd provides almost double
      the compression with little additional cpu overhead.

      (@thampiotr)
    - Fixed an issue where indexing targets as maps (e.g.
      target["foo"]) or objects (e.g. target.foo) or using them
      with certain standard library functions was resulting in
      expected object or array, got capsule error under some
      circumstances. This could also lead to foreach evaluation
      failed errors when using the foreach configuration block.
      (@thampiotr)
    - Update prometheus.write.queue to reduce memory fragmentation
      and increase sent throughput. (@mattdurham)
    - Fixed an issue where the otelcol.exporter.kafka component
      would not start if the encoding was specific to a signal
      type. (@wildum)

      is not supported". (@thampiotr)
    - Enable batching of calls to the appender in
      prometheus.write.queue to reduce lock contention when
      scraping, which will lead to reduced scrape duration.
      (@mattdurham)

      prometheus.exporter.mongodb configuration as it does not
      configure TLS client behavior as previously documented.
    - Remove encoding and encoding_file_ext from
      otelcol.exporter.awss3 component as it was not wired in to
      the otel component and Alloy does not currently integrate the
      upstream encoding extensions that this would utilize.

  * Security fixes
    - Add quotes to windows service path to prevent path
      interception attack. CVE-2024-8975 (@mattdurham)
  * Breaking changes
    - Some debug metrics for otelcol components have changed.
      (@thampiotr) For example, otelcol.exporter.otlp's
      exporter_sent_spans_ratio_total metric is now
      otelcol_exporter_sent_spans_total.
    - [otelcol.processor.transform] The functions
      convert_sum_to_gauge and convert_gauge_to_sum must now be
      used in the metric context rather than in the datapoint
      context.
      open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib#34567

      latest values to the next component in the pipeline.
  * Enhancements
    - Clustering peer resolution through --cluster.join-addresses
      flag has been improved with more consistent behaviour, better
      error handling and added support for A/AAAA DNS records. If
      necessary, users can temporarily opt out of this new
      behaviour with the --cluster.use-discovery-v1, but this can
      only be used as a temporary measure, since this flag will be
      disabled in future releases. (@thampiotr)
    - Added a new panel to Cluster Overview dashboard to show the
      number of peers seen by each instance in the cluster. This
      can help diagnose cluster split brain issues. (@thampiotr)
    - Updated Snowflake exporter with performance improvements for
      larger environments.  Also added a new panel to track deleted
      tables to the Snowflake mixin. (@Caleb-Hurshman)

      collected metrics that match specified attributes from
      opentelemetry. (@kehindesalaam)
    - Update windows_exporter to v0.27.2. (@jkroepke) The
      smb.enabled_list and smb_client.enabled_list doesn't have any
      effect anymore. All sub-collectors are enabled by default.
  * Bugfixes
    - Fix a bug where the scrape timeout for a Probe resource was
      not applied, overwriting the scrape interval instead.
      (@morremeyer, @stefanandres)
    - Fix a bug where custom components don't always get updated
      when the config is modified in an imported directory.
      (@ante012)
    - Fixed an issue where providing <hostname>:<port> in
      --cluster.join-addresses would only resolve with DNS to a
      single address, instead of using all the available records.
      (@thampiotr)

  For a full list of changes, please refer to the CHANGELOG!
  https://github.com/grafana/alloy/blob/v1.2.0/CHANGELOG.md#v120
  * Breaking changes
    - Updated OpenTelemetry to v0.102.1. (@mattdurham)
      - Components
        otelcol.receiver.otlp,otelcol.receiver.zipkin,otelcol.extension.jaeger_remote_sampling,
        and otelcol.receiver.jaeger setting max_request_body_size
        default changed from unlimited size to 20MiB. This is due
        to CVE-2024-36129.
  * Breaking changes to non-GA functionality
    - Component otelcol.receiver.vcenter removed
      vcenter.host.network.packet.errors,
      vcenter.host.network.packet.count, and
      vcenter.vm.network.packet.count.
      - vcenter.host.network.packet.errors replaced by
        vcenter.host.network.packet.error.rate.
      - vcenter.host.network.packet.count replaced by
        vcenter.host.network.packet.rate.
      - vcenter.vm.network.packet.count replaced by
        vcenter.vm.network.packet.rate.
  * Features
    - Add an otelcol.exporter.kafka component to send OTLP metrics,
      logs, and traces to Kafka.
    - Added live debugging to the UI. Live debugging streams data
      as they flow through components for debugging telemetry data.
      Individual components must be updated to support live
      debugging. (@wildum)
    - Added live debugging support for prometheus.relabel.
      (@wildum)
    - (Experimental) Add a otelcol.processor.deltatocumulative
      component to convert metrics from delta temporality to
      cumulative by accumulating samples in memory. (@rfratto)
    - (Experimental) Add an otelcol.receiver.datadog component to
      receive metrics and traces from Datadog. (@carrieedwards,
      @jesusvazquez, @alexgreenbank, @fedetorres93)
  * Enhancements
    - (Public preview) Add native histogram support to
      otelcol.receiver.prometheus. (@wildum)
    - Added scrape_protocols option to prometheus.scrape, which
      allows to control the preferred order of scrape protocols.
      (@thampiotr)
    - Improved filesystem error handling when working with
      loki.source.file and local.file_match, which removes some
      false-positive error log messages on Windows (@thampiotr)
    - Updates receiver/vcenter to use new features and bugfixes
      introduced in OTEL releases v0.100.0 and v0.101.0.  Refer to
      the v0.100.0 and v0.101.0 release notes for more detailed
      information.

    - otelcol.processor.resourcedetection: Added a tags config
      argument to the azure detection mechanism. It exposes
      regex-matched Azure resource tags as OpenTelemetry resource
      attributes.
  * Bugfixes
    - Fixed an issue with prometheus.scrape in which targets that
      move from one cluster instance to another could have a
      staleness marker inserted and result in a gap in metrics
      (@thampiotr)
    - Fix panic when import.git is given a revision that does not
      exist on the remote repo. (@hainenber)
    - Fixed an issue with loki.source.docker where collecting logs
      from targets configured with multiple networks would result
      in errors. (@wildum)
