%description
This package provides the following scripts for ART:
  * colormix.ctl: mixes a user-selected RGB color with the image, using various blending modes
  * density.ctl: increase saturation while also lowering luminance, emulating "film density" filters available for some video editors
  * gamutcompress.ctl: gamut compression using the ACES method
  * hueeq.ctl: adjust the hue, saturation or luminance of each pixel according to its hue
  * lumeq.ctl: adjust the hue, saturation or luminance of each pixel according to its luminance
  * odt.ctl: ART's take on tone mapping from scene to display
  * posterize.ctl: simulates a posterization effect given by reducing the bit depth of the image
  * sateq.ctl: adjust the hue, saturation or luminance of each pixel according to its saturation
  * submix.ctl: mixes a user-selected RGB color with the image in a subtractive manner (i.e. as if the two colors were mixed like paint colors)
  * tetrahsl.ctl: color warping by means of tetrahedral division of the RGB color cube, using a HSL interface
  * tetrargb.ctl: tetrahedral color warping using the original RGB interface
  * tinteq.ctl: add a color cast to each pixel according to its luminance
  * wbchmix.ctl: white balance and RGB primaries correction
