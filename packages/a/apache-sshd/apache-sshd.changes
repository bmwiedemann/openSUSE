- Updated to upstream version 2.14.0
- Changes in version 2.14.0
  * Bug Fixes
    + GH-524 Performance improvements
    + GH-533 Fix multi-step authentication
    + GH-582 Fix filtering in NamedFactory
    + GH-587 Prevent NullPointerExceptionon closed channel in
      NettyIoSession
    + GH-590 Better support for FIPS
    + GH-597 Pass on Charset in
      ClientSession.executeRemoteCommand()
  * New Features
    + New utility methods SftpClient.put(Path localFile, String
      remoteFileName) and SftpClient.put(InputStream in, String
      remoteFileName) facilitate SFTP file uploading.
  * GH-590 Better support for FIPS
    Besides fixing a bug with bc-fips (the RandomGenerator class
    exists in normal Bouncy Castle, but not in the FIPS version,
    but Apache MINA sshd referenced it even if only bc-fips was
    present), support was improved for running in an environment
    restricted by FIPS.
    There is a new system property
    org.apache.sshd.security.fipsEnabled. If set to true, a number
    of crypto-algorithms not approved by FIPS 140 are disabled:
      + key exchange methods sntrup761x25519-sha512,
        sntrup761x25519-sha512@openssh.com, curve25519-sha256,
        curve25519-sha256@libssh.org, curve448-sha512.
      + the chacha20-poly1305 cipher.
      + the bcrypt KDF used in encrypted private key files in
        OpenSSH format.
      + all ed25519 keys and signatures.
    Additionally, the new "SunJCEWrapper" SecurityProviderRegistrar
    (see below) and the EdDSASecurityProviderRegistrar are
    disabled, and the BouncyCastleScurityProviderRegistrar looks
    only for the "BCFIPS" security provider, not for the normal
    "BC" provider.
    If the system property is not set to true, FIPS mode can be
    enabled programmatically by calling SecurityUtils.setFipsMode()
    before any other call to Apache MINA sshd.
  * Potential compatibility issues
    + New security provider registrar
      There is a new SecurityProviderRegistrar that is registered
      by default if there is a SunJCE security provider. It uses
      the AES and HmacSHA* implementations from SunJCE even if
      Bouncy Castle is also registered. SunJCE has native
      implementations, whereas Bouncy Castle may not.
      The new registrar has the name "SunJCEWrapper" and can be
      configured like any other registrar. It can be disabled via
      the system property
      org.apache.sshd.security.provider.SunJCEWrapper.enabled=false.
      It is also disabled in FIPS mode (see above).
    + GH-582 Fix filtering in NamedFactory
      The methods NamedFactory.setupBuiltinFactories(boolean
      ignoreUnsupported, ...) and
      NamedFactory.setupTransformedFactories(boolean
      ignoreUnsupported, ...) had a bug that gave the
      "ignoreUnsupported" parameter actually the meaning of
      "include unsupported".
      This was fixed in this release, but existing code calling
      these or one of the following methods:
        ~ BaseBuilder.setUpDefaultMacs(boolean ignoreUnsupported)
        ~ BaseBuilder.setUpDefaultCiphers(boolean ignoreUnsupported)
        ~ ClientBuilder.setUpDefaultCompressionFactories(boolean
          ignoreUnsupported)
        ~ ClientBuilder.setUpDefaultKeyExchanges(boolean
          ignoreUnsupported)
        ~ ClientBuilder.setUpDefaultSignatureFactories(boolean
          ignoreUnsupported)
        ~ ServerBuilder.setUpDefaultCompressionFactories(boolean
          ignoreUnsupported)
        ~ ServerBuilder.setUpDefaultKeyExchanges(boolean
          ignoreUnsupported)
        ~ ServerBuilder.setUpDefaultSignatureFactories(boolean
          ignoreUnsupported)
        ~ any of the methods starting with
          SshConfigFileReader.configure
        ~ SshClientConfigFileReader.configure(...)
        ~ SshServerConfigFileReader.configure(...)
      should be reviewed:
        ~ if the method is called with parameter value true, the
          result will no longer include unsupported algorithms.
          Formerly it wrongly did.
        ~ if the method is called with parameter value false, the
          result may include unsupported algorithms. Formerly it
          did not.
      So if existing code used parameter value false to ensure it
      never got unsupported algorithms, change it to true.

      The key exchange method sntrup761x25519-sha512@openssh.com is
      now available if the Bouncy Castle library is available.
      This uses a post-quantum key encapsulation method (KEM) to
      make key exchange future-proof against quantum attacks.

    + Behavioral changes and enhancements
      ~ GH-318 Handle cascaded proxy jumps
        Proxy jumps can be configured via host configuration
        entries in two ways. First, proxies can be chained directly
        by specifiying several proxies in one ProxyJump directive:
          Host target
          Hostname somewhere.example.org
          User some_user
          IdentityFile ~/.ssh/some_id
          ProxyJump jumphost2, jumphost1
          
          Host jumphost1
          Hostname jumphost1@example.org
          User jumphost1_user
          IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_jumphost1

          Host jumphost2
          Hostname jumphost2@example.org
          User jumphost2_user
          IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_jumphost2

        Connecting to server target will first connect to
        jumphost1, then tunnel through to jumphost2, and finally
        tunnel to target. So the full connection will be
        client→jumphost1→jumphost2→target.
        Such proxy jump chains were already supported in Apache
        MINA SSHD.
        Newly, Apache MINA SSHD also supports cascading proxy
        jumps, so a configuration like
          Host target
          Hostname somewhere.example.org
          User some_user
          IdentityFile ~/.ssh/some_id
          ProxyJump jumphost2

          Host jumphost1
          Hostname jumphost1@example.org
          User jumphost1_user
          IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_jumphost1

          Host jumphost2
          Hostname jumphost2@example.org
          ProxyJump jumphost1
          User jumphost2_user
          IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_jumphost2
        also works now, and produces the same connection
        client→jumphost1→jumphost2→target.

        It is possible to mis-configure such proxy jump cascades to
        have loops. (For instance, if host jumphost1 in the above
        example had a ProxyJump jumphost2 directive.) To catch such
        misconfigurations, Apache MINA SSHD imposes an upper limit
        on the total number of proxy jumps in a connection. An
        exception is thrown if there are more than
        CoreModuleProperties.MAX_PROXY_JUMPS proxy jumps in a
        connection. The default value of this property is 10. Most
        real uses of proxy jumps will have one or maybe two proxy
        jumps only.
      ~ GH-461 Fix heartbeats with wantReply=true
        The client-side heartbeat mechanism has been updated. Such
        heartbeats are configured via the
        CoreModuleProperties.HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL property. If this
        interval is > 0, heartbeats are sent to the server.
        Previously these heartbeats could also be configured with a
        CoreModuleProperties.HEARTBEAT_REPLY_WAIT timeout. If the
        timeout was <= 0, the client would just send heartbeat
        requests without expecting any answers. If the timeout was
        > 0, the client would send requests with a flag indicating
        that the server should reply. The client would then wait
        for the specified duration for the reply and would
        terminate the connection if none was received.
        This mechanism could cause trouble if the timeout was
        fairly long and the server was slow to respond. A timeout
        longer than the interval could also delay subsequent
        heartbeats.
        The CoreModuleProperties.HEARTBEAT_REPLY_WAIT property is
        now deprecated.
        There is a new configuration property
        CoreModuleProperties.HEARTBEAT_NO_REPLY_MAX instead. It
        defines a limit for the number of heartbeats sent without
        receiving a reply before a session is terminated. If the
        value is <= 0, the client still sends heartbeats without
        expecting any reply. If the value is > 0, the client will
        request a reply from the server for each heartbeat message,
        and it will terminate the connection if the number of
        unanswered heartbeats reaches
        CoreModuleProperties.HEARTBEAT_NO_REPLY_MAX.
        This new way to configure heartbeats aligns with the
        OpenSSH configuration options ServerAliveInterval and
        ServerAliveCountMax.
        For compatibility with older configurations that explicitly
        define CoreModuleProperties.HEARTBEAT_REPLY_WAIT, the new
        code maps this to the new configuration (but only if
        CoreModuleProperties.HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL > 0 and the new
        property CoreModuleProperties.HEARTBEAT_NO_REPLY_MAX has
        not been set) by setting
        CoreModuleProperties.HEARTBEAT_NO_REPLY_MAX to
          = CoreModuleProperties.HEARTBEAT_REPLY_WAIT <= 0:
            CoreModuleProperties.HEARTBEAT_NO_REPLY_MAX = 0
          = otherwise: (CoreModuleProperties.HEARTBEAT_REPLY_WAIT /
            CoreModuleProperties.HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL) + 1.
      ~ GH-468 SFTP: validate length of data received: must not be
        more than requested
        SFTP read operations now check the amount of data they get
        back. If it's more than requested an exception is thrown.
        SFTP servers must never return more data than the client
        requested, but it appears that there are some that do so.
        If property SftpModuleProperties.TOLERATE_EXCESS_DATA is
        set to true, a warning is logged and such excess data is
        silently discarded.
  * Potential compatibility issues
    + AES-CBC ciphers removed from server's defaults
      The AES-CBC ciphers aes128-cbc, aes192-cbc, and aes256-cbc
      have been removed from the default list of cipher algorithms
      that a server proposes in the key exchange. OpenSSH has
      removed these cipher algorithms from the server proposal in
      2014, and has removed them from the client proposal in 2017.
      The cipher implementations still exist but they are not
      enabled by default. Existing code that explicitly sets the
      cipher factories is unaffected. Code that relies on the
      default settings will newly create a server that does not
      support the CBC-mode ciphers. To enable the CBC-mode ciphers,
      one can use for instance
        SshServer server = ServerBuilder.builder()
          ...
          .cipherFactories(BuiltinFactory.setUpFactories(false,
              BaseBuilder.DEFAULT_CIPHERS_PREFERENCES));
          ...
          .build();
      For the SSH client, the CBC ciphers are still enabled by
      default to facilitate connecting to legacy servers. We plan
      to remove the CBC ciphers from the client's defaults in the
      next release.

Fri Jul 30 08:13:19 UTC 2021 - Fridrich Strba <fstrba@suse.com>

- Upgrade to version 2.7.0
- Changes in version 2.5.0
  * Major code re-factoring
    + Reception of an SSH_MSG_UNIMPLEMENTED response to a
      SSH_MSG_GLOBAL_REQUEST is translated internally into same code
      flow as if an SSH_MSH_REQUEST_FAILURE has been received - see
      SSHD-968.
    + Server SFTP subsystem internal code dealing with the local
      files has been delegated to the SftpFileSystemAccessor in
      order to allow easier hooking into the SFTP subsystem.
      - Resolving a local file path for an SFTP remote one
      - Reading/Writing a file's attribute(s)
      - Creating files links
      - Copying / Renaming / Deleting files
    + SftpVersionSelector is now consulted when client sends initial
      command (as well as when session is re-negotiated)
    + ScpCommandFactory is also a ShellFactory that can be used to
      provide a minimalistic shell that is good enough for WinSCP.
    + Rework SFTP streams so that the client asks and receives as
      much data as possible - see SSHD-979.
  * Minor code helpers
    + Handling of debug/ignore/unimplemented messages has been split
      into handleXXX and doInvokeXXXMsgHandler methods where the
      former validate the messages and deal with the idle timeout,
      and the latter execute the actual invcation.
    + Added overloaded methods that accept a java.time.Duration
      specifier for timeout value.
    + The argument representing the SFTP subsystem in invocations to
      SftpFileSystemAccessor has been enhanced to expose as much of
      the available functionality as possible.
  * Behavioral changes and enhancements
    + SSHD-964 - Send SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_EOF when tunnel channel being
      closed.
    + SSHD-967 - Extra bytes written when
      SftpRemotePathChannel#transferTo is used.
    + SSHD-968 - Interpret SSH_MSG_UNIMPLEMENTED response to a
      heartbeat request as a liveness indicator
    + SSHD-970 - transferTo function of SftpRemotePathChannel will
      loop if count parameter is greater than file size

      written in between.
- Changes in version 2.6.0
  * Major code re-factoring
