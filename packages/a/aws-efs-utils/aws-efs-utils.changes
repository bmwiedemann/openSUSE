Tue Nov  3 15:03:24 UTC 2020 - Franck Bui <fbui@suse.com>

- Drop '-f' option with %service_del_preun/%service_del_postun

  With %service_del_preun, the option is already ignored with as
  support for DISABLE_STOP_ON_REMOVAL has been dropped.

  With %service_del_postun, this option shouldn't be needed besides
  very few special cases. But this package doesn't seem to belong to
  this category.

      on the NFS lease length we can recover from network partitions sooner.

      Authority (CA). To maximize file system availability in the event that the CA is
      not reachable from your VPC, the EFS mount helper no longer enables OCSP by default.
