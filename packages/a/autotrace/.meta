  <title>Program for Converting Bitmaps to Vector Graphics</title>
  <description>AutoTrace is a program for converting bitmaps to vector graphics. The
aim of the AutoTrace project is the development of a freely-available
application similar to CorelTrace or Adobe Streamline. In some aspects,
it is already better. Originally created as a plug-in for the GIMP,
AutoTrace is now a stand-alone program and can be compiled on any UNIX
platform using GCC.</description>
