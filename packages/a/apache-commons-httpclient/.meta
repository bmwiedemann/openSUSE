  <title>Feature rich package for accessing resources via HTTP</title>
  <description>Although the java.net  package provides basic functionality for
accessing resources via HTTP, it doesn't provide the full flexibility
or functionality needed by many applications. The Jakarta Commons
HttpClient component seeks to fill this void by providing an efficient,
up-to-date, and feature-rich package implementing the client side of
the most recent HTTP standards and recommendations.

Designed for extension while providing robust support for the base HTTP
protocol, the HttpClient component may be of interest to anyone
building HTTP-aware client applications such as web browsers, web
service clients, or systems that leverage or extend the HTTP protocol
for distributed communication.</description>
