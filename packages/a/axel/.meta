  <title>Lightweight Download Accelerator</title>
  <description>Axel tries to accelerate HTTP/FTP downloading process by using multiple
connections for one file. It can use multiple mirrors for a download. Axel has
no dependencies and is lightweight, so it might be useful as a wget clone on
byte-critical systems.
