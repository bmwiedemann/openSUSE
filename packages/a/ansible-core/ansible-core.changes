Thu Nov 14 16:23:53 UTC 2024 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- update to 2.17.6:
  https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/v2.17.6/changelogs/CHANGELOG-v2.17.rst
  * Minor Changes
    - ansible-test - Improve container runtime probe error
      handling. When unexpected probe output is encountered, an
      error with more useful debugging information is provided.
  * Security Fixes
    - include_vars action - Ensure that result masking is correctly
      requested when vault-encrypted files are read.
      (CVE-2024-8775)
    - task result processing - Ensure that action-sourced result
      masking (_ansible_no_log=True) is preserved. (CVE-2024-8775)
    - user action won't allow ssh-keygen, chown and chmod to run on
      existing ssh public key file, avoiding traversal on existing
      symlinks (CVE-2024-9902).
  * Bugfixes
    - Fix disabling SSL verification when installing collections
      and roles from git repositories. If --ignore-certs isn't
      provided, the value for the GALAXY_IGNORE_CERTS configuration
      option will be used (#83326).
    - Improve performance on large inventories by reducing the
      number of implicit meta tasks.
    - Use the requested error message in the
      ansible.module_utils.facts.timeout timeout function instead
      of hardcoding one.
    - ansible-test - Enable the sys.unraisablehook work-around for
      the pylint sanity test on Python 3.11. Previously the
      work-around was only enabled for Python 3.12 and later.
      However, the same issue has been discovered on Python 3.11.
    - debconf - set empty password values (#83214).
    - facts - skip if distribution file path is directory, instead
      of raising error (#84006).
    - user action will now require O(force) to overwrite the public
      part of an ssh key when generating ssh keys, as was already
      the case for the private part.
    - user module now avoids changing ownership of files symlinked
      in provided home dir skeleton

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct 11 05:23:38 UTC 2024 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- update to 2.17.5:
  https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/v2.17.5/changelogs/CHANGELOG-v2.17.rst
  * Bugfixes
    - Add descriptions for ansible-galaxy install --help` and
      ``ansible-galaxy role|collection install --help.
    - Errors now preserve stacked error messages even when YAML is
      involved.
    - ansible-galaxy install --help - Fix the usage text and
      document that the requirements file passed to -r can include
      collections and roles.
    - copy - mtime/atime not updated. Fix now update
      mtime/atime(#83013)
    - delay keyword is now a float, matching the underlying 'time'
      API and user expectations.
    - dnf5 - re-introduce the state: installed alias to state:
      present (#83960)
    - module_utils atomic_move (used by most file based modules),
      now correctly handles permission copy and setting mtime
      correctly across all paths

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 11 05:24:58 UTC 2024 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- update to 2.17.4:
  https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/v2.17.4/changelogs/CHANGELOG-v2.17.rst
  * Bugfixes
    - Fix SemanticVersion.parse() to store the version string so
      that __repr__ reports it instead of None (#83831).
    - Fix an issue where registered variable was not available for
      templating in loop_control.label on skipped looped tasks
      (#83619)
    - Fix for meta tasks breaking host/fork affinity with
      host_pinned strategy (#83294)
    - Fix using the current task's directory for looking up
      relative paths within roles (#82695).
    - atomic_move - fix using the setgid bit on the parent
      directory when creating files (#46742, #67177).
    - connection plugins using the 'extras' option feature would
      need variables to match the plugin's loaded name, sometimes
      requiring fqcn, which is not the same as the
      documented/declared/expected variables. Now we fall back to
      the 'basename' of the fqcn, but plugin authors can still set
      the expected value directly.
    - csvfile lookup - give an error when no search term is
      provided using modern config syntax (#83689).
    - include_tasks - Display location when attempting to load a
      task list where include_* did not specify any value - #83874
    - powershell - Improve CLIXML decoding to decode all control
      characters and unicode characters that are encoded as
      surrogate pairs.
    - psrp - Fix bug when attempting to fetch a file path that
      contains special glob characters like []
    - runtime-metadata sanity test - do not crash on deprecations
      if galaxy.yml contains an empty version field (#83831).
    - ssh - Fix bug when attempting to fetch a file path with
      characters that should be quoted when using the piped
      transfer method

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug 13 17:47:30 UTC 2024 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- update to 2.17.3:
  https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/v2.17.3/changelogs/CHANGELOG-v2.17.rst
  * Minor Changes
    - ansible-test - Improve the error message shown when an
      unknown --remote or --docker option is given.
    - ansible-test - Removed the vyos/1.1.8 network remote as it is
      no longer functional.
  * Bugfixes
    - Warning now includes filename and line number of variable
      when specifying a list of dictionaries for vars (#82528).
    - config, restored the ability to set module compression via a
      variable
    - debconf - fix normalization of value representation for
      boolean vtypes in new packages (#83594)
    - linear strategy: fix handlers included via include_tasks
      handler to be executed in lockstep (#83019)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul 16 05:47:40 UTC 2024 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- update to 2.17.2:
  https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/v2.17.2/changelogs/CHANGELOG-v2.17.rst
  * Bugfixes
    - Fix a traceback when an environment variable contains certain
      special characters (#83498)
    - dnf - reverted incomplete fix from 2.17.2rc1 (#83504)
    - dnf, dnf5 - fix for installing a set of packages by
      specifying them using a wildcard character (#83373)
    - linear strategy now provides a properly templated task name
      to the v2_runner_on_started callback event.
    - package_facts - ignore warnings sent by apk on stderr
      (#83501).
    - replace - Updated before/after example (#83390).
    - templating hostvars under native jinja will not cause
      serialization errors anymore.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jul 14 16:01:58 UTC 2024 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- update to 2.17.1:
  https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/v2.17.1/changelogs/CHANGELOG-v2.17.rst
  * Minor Changes
    - ansible-test - Update pypi-test-container to version 3.1.0.
  * Bugfixes
    - Fix rapid memory usage growth when notifying handlers using
      the listen keyword (#83392)
    - Fix the task attribute resolved_action to show the FQCN
      instead of None when action or local_action is used in the
      playbook.
    - Fix using module_defaults with local_action/action (#81905).
    - fixed unit test test_borken_cowsay to address mock not been
      properly applied when existing unix system already have
      cowsay installed.
    - powershell - Implement more robust deletion mechanism for C#
      code compilation temporary files. This should avoid scenarios
      where the underlying temporary directory may be temporarily
      locked by antivirus tools or other IO problems. A failure to
      delete one of these temporary directories will result in a
      warning rather than an outright failure.
    - shell plugin - properly quote all needed components of shell
      commands (#82535)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jul 14 15:27:58 UTC 2024 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- update to 2.17.0:
  https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/v2.17.0/changelogs/CHANGELOG-v2.17.rst
  * Major Changes
    - urls.py - Removed support for Python 2
  * Minor Changes
    - Add dump and passno mount information to facts component
      (#80478)
    - Added MIRACLE LINUX 9.2 in RedHat OS Family.
    - Interpreter Discovery - Remove hardcoded references to
      specific python interpreters to use for certain distro
      versions, and modify logic for python3 to become the default.
    - Use Python's built-in functools.update_wrapper instead an
      inline copy from Python 3.7.
    - User can now set ansible.log to record higher verbosity than
      what is specified for display via new configuration item
      LOG_VERBOSITY.
    - DEFAULT_PRIVATE_ROLE_VARS is now overridden by explicit
      setting of public for include_roles and import_roles.
    - ansible-galaxy role|collection init - accept --extra-vars to
      supplement/override the variables ansible-galaxy injects for
      templating .j2 files in the skeleton.
    - import_role action now also gets a public option that
      controls variable exports, default depending on
      DEFAULT_PRIVATE_ROLE_VARS (if using defaults equates to
      public=True).
    - added configuration item TARGET_LOG_INFO that allows the
      user/author to add an information string to the log output on
      targets.
    - ansible-doc - treat double newlines in documentation strings
      as paragraph breaks. This is useful to create multi-paragraph
      notes in module/plugin documentation (#82465).
    - ansible-doc output has been revamped to make it more visually
      pleasing when going to a terminal, also more concise, use -v
      to show extra information.
    - ansible-galaxy - Started normalizing build directory with a
      trailing separator when building collections, internally.
      (#81619).
    - ansible-galaxy dependency resolution messages have changed
      the unexplained 'virtual' collection for the specific type
      ('scm', 'dir', etc) that is more user friendly
    - ansible-test - Add Alpine 3.19 container.
    - ansible-test - Add Alpine 3.19 to remotes.
    - ansible-test - Add Fedora 39 container.
    - ansible-test - Add Fedora 39 remote.
    - ansible-test - Add a work-around for permission denied errors
      when using pytest >= 8 on multi-user systems with an
      installed version of ansible-test.
    - ansible-test - Add support for RHEL 9.3 remotes.
    - ansible-test - Added a macOS 14.3 remote VM.
    - ansible-test - Bump the nios-test-container from version
      2.0.0 to version 3.0.0.
    - ansible-test - Containers and remotes managed by ansible-test
      will have their Python EXTERNALLY-MANAGED marker (PEP668)
      removed. This provides backwards compatibility for existing
      tests running in newer environments which mark their Python
      as externally managed. A future version of ansible-test may
      change this behavior, requiring tests to be adapted to such
      environments.
    - ansible-test - Make Python 3.12 the default version used in
      the base and default containers.
    - ansible-test - Remove Alpine 3(.18) container.
    - ansible-test - Remove Alpine 3.18 from remotes.
    - ansible-test - Remove Fedora 38 remote support.
    - ansible-test - Remove Fedora 38 test container.
    - ansible-test - Remove rhel/9.2 test remote
    - ansible-test - Remove the FreeBSD 13.2 remote.
    - ansible-test - Removed fallback to virtualenv when -m venv is
      non-functional.
    - ansible-test - Removed test remotes: macos/13.2
    - ansible-test - Removed the no-basestring sanity test. The
      test is no longer necessary now that Python 3 is required.
    - ansible-test - Removed the no-dict-iteritems,
      no-dict-iterkeys and no-dict-itervalues sanity tests. The
      tests are no longer necessary since Python 3 is required.
    - ansible-test - Removed the no-main-display sanity test. The
      unwanted pattern is unlikely to occur, since the test has
      existed since Ansible 2.8.
    - ansible-test - Removed the no-unicode-literals sanity test.
      The test is unnecessary now that Python 3 is required and the
      unicode_literals feature has no effect.
    - ansible-test - Special handling for installation of
      cryptography has been removed, as it is no longer necessary.
    - ansible-test - The shellcheck sanity test no longer disables
      the SC2164 check. In most cases, seeing this error means the
      script is missing set -e.
    - ansible-test - The unidiomatic-typecheck rule has been
      enabled in the pylint sanity test.
    - ansible-test - The unidiomatic-typecheck rule has been
      removed from the validate-modules sanity test.
    - ansible-test - Update the base and default containers to use
      Ubuntu 22.04 for the base image. This also updates PowerShell
      to version 7.4.0 with .NET 8.0.0 and ShellCheck to version
      0.8.0.
    - ansible-test - Updated the CloudStack test container to
      version 1.7.0.
    - ansible-test - Updated the distro test containers to version
      6.3.0 to include coverage 7.3.2 for Python 3.8+. The alpine3
      container is now based on 3.18 instead of 3.17 and includes
      Python 3.11 instead of Python 3.10.
    - ansible-test - Updated the distro test containers to version
      7.1.0.
    - ansible-test - When ansible-test installs requirements, it
      now instructs pip to allow installs on externally managed
      environments as defined by PEP 668. This only occurs in
      ephemeral environments managed by ansible-test, such as
      containers, or when the --requirements option is used.
    - ansible-test - When invoking sleep in containers during
      container setup, the env command is used to avoid invoking
      the shell builtin, if present.
    - ansible-test - document block name now included in error
      message for YAML parsing errors (#82353).
    - ansible-test - sanity test allows EXAMPLES to be
      multi-document YAML (#82353).
    - ansible-test now has FreeBSD 13.3 and 14.0 support
    - ansible.builtin.user - Remove user not found warning (#80267)
    - apt_repository.py - use api.launchpad.net endpoint instead of
      launchpad.net/api
    - async tasks can now also support check mode at the same time.
    - async_status now supports check mode.
    - constructed inventory plugin - Adding a note that only
      group_vars of explicit groups are loaded (#82580).
    - csvfile - add a keycol parameter to specify in which column
      to search.
    - dnf - add the best option
    - dnf5 - add the best option
    - filter plugin - Add the count and mandatory_count parameters
      in the regex_replace filter
    - find - add a encoding parameter to specify which encoding of
      the files to be searched.
    - git module - gpg_allowlist name was added in 2.17 and we will
      eventually deprecate the gpg_whitelist alias.
    - import_role - allow subdirectories with `_from` options for
      parity with include_role (#82584).
    - module argument spec - Allow module authors to include
      arbitrary additional context in the argument spec, by making
      use of a new top level key called context. This key should be
      a dict type. This allows for users to customize what they
      place in the argument spec, without having to ignore sanity
      tests that validate the schema.
    - modules - Add the ability for an action plugin to call
      self._execute_module(*, ignore_unknown_opts=True) to execute
      a module with options that may not be supported for the
      version being called. This tells the module basic wrapper to
      ignore validating the options provided match the arg spec.
    - package action now has a configuration that overrides the
      detected package manager, it is still overridden itself by
      the use option.
    - py3compat - Remove ansible.utils.py3compat as it is no longer
      necessary
    - removed the unused argument create_new_password from
      CLI.build_vault_ids (#82066).
    - urls - Add support for TLS 1.3 post handshake certificate
      authentication - #81782
    - urls - reduce complexity of Request.open
    - user - accept yescrypt hash as user password
    - validate-modules tests now correctly handles choices in
      dictionary format.
  * Breaking Changes / Porting Guide
    - assert - Nested templating may result in an inability for the
      conditional to be evaluated. See the porting guide for more
      information.
  * Deprecated Features
    - Old style vars plugins which use the entrypoints
      get_host_vars or get_group_vars are deprecated. The plugin
      should be updated to inherit from BaseVarsPlugin and define a
      get_vars method as the entrypoint.
    - The 'required' parameter in
      'ansible.module_utils.common.process.get_bin_path' API is
      deprecated (#82464).
    - module_utils - importing the following convenience helpers
      from ansible.module_utils.basic has been deprecated:
      get_exception, literal_eval, _literal_eval, datetime, signal,
      types, chain, repeat, PY2, PY3, b, binary_type,
      integer_types, iteritems, string_types, test_type, map and
      shlex_quote.
    - ansible-doc - role entrypoint attributes are deprecated and
      eventually will no longer be shown in ansible-doc from
      ansible-core 2.20 on (#82639, #82678).
    - paramiko connection plugin, configuration items in the global
      scope are being deprecated and will be removed in favor or
      the existing same options in the plugin itself. Users should
      not need to change anything (how to configure them are the
      same) but plugin authors using the global constants should
      move to using the plugin's get_option().
  * Removed Features (previously deprecated)
    - Remove deprecated APIs from ansible-docs (#81716).
    - Remove deprecated JINJA2_NATIVE_WARNING environment variable
      (#81714)
    - Remove deprecated scp_if_ssh from ssh connection plugin
      (#81715).
    - Remove deprecated crypt support from ansible.utils.encrypt
      (#81717)
    - Removed Python 2.7 and Python 3.6 as a supported remote
      version. Python 3.7+ is now required for target execution.
    - With the removal of Python 2 support, the yum module and yum
      action plugin are removed and redirected to dnf.
  * Security Fixes
    - ANSIBLE_NO_LOG - Address issue where ANSIBLE_NO_LOG was
      ignored (CVE-2024-0690)
    - ansible-galaxy - Prevent roles from using symlinks to
      overwrite files outside of the installation directory
      (CVE-2023-5115)
    - templating - Address issues where internal templating can
      cause unsafe variables to lose their unsafe designation
      (CVE-2023-5764)
  * Bugfixes
    - Add a version ceiling constraint for pypsrp to avoid
      potential breaking changes in the 1.0.0 release.
    - All core lookups now use set_option(s) even when doing their
      own custom parsing. This ensures that the options are always
      the proper type.
    - Allow for searching handler subdir for included task via
      include_role (#81722)
    - AnsibleModule.atomic_move - fix preserving extended ACLs of
      the destination when it exists (#72929).
    - Cache host_group_vars after instantiating it once and limit
      the amount of repetitive work it needs to do every time it
      runs.
    - Call PluginLoader.all() once for vars plugins, and load vars
      plugins that run automatically or are enabled specifically by
      name subsequently.
    - Consolidate systemd detection logic into one place (#80975).
    - Consolidated the list of internal static vars, centralized
      them as constant and completed from some missing entries.
    - Do not print undefined error message twice (#78703).
    - Enable file cache for vaulted files during vars lookup to fix
      a strong performance penalty in huge and complex playbboks.
    - Fix NEVRA parsing of package names that include digit(s) in
      them (#76463, #81018)

    - Fix run_once being incorrectly interpreted on handlers
      (#81666)
    - Fix an issue when setting a plugin name from an unsafe source
      resulted in ValueError: unmarshallable object (#82708)
    - Fix check for missing _sub_plugin attribute in older
      connection plugins (#82954)
    - Fix condition for unquoting configuration strings from ini
      files (#82387).
    - Fix for when any_errors_fatal was ignored if error occurred
      in a block with always (#31543)
    - Fix handlers not being executed in lockstep using the linear
      strategy in some cases (#82307)
    - Fix handling missing urls in
      ansible.module_utils.urls.fetch_file for Python 3.
    - Fix issue where an include_tasks handler in a role was not
      able to locate a file in tasks/ when tasks_from was used as a
      role entry point and main.yml was not present (#82241)
    - Fix issues when tasks withing nested blocks wouldn't run when
      force_handlers is set (#81533)

    - Fix notifying role handlers by listen keyword topics with the
      "role_name : " prefix (#82849).
    - Fix setting proper locale for git executable when running on
      non english systems, ensuring git output can always be
      parsed.
    - Fix tasks in always section not being executed for nested
      blocks with any_errors_fatal (#73246)
    - Fixes permission for cache json file from 600 to 644
      (#82683).
    - Give the tombstone error for include pre-fork like other
      tombstoned action/module plugins.
    - Harden python templates for respawn and ansiballz around str
      literal quoting
    - Include the task location when a module or action plugin is
      deprecated (#82450).
    - Interpreter discovery - Add Amzn to OS_FAMILY_MAP for correct
      family fallback for interpreter discovery (#80882).
    - Mirror the behavior of dnf on the command line when handling
      NEVRAs with omitted epoch (#71808)
    - Plugin loader does not dedupe nor cache filter/test plugins
      by file basename, but full path name.
    - Properly template tags in parent blocks (#81053)
    - Provide additional information about the alternative plugin
      in the deprecation message (#80561).
    - Remove the galaxy_info field platforms from the role
      templates (#82453).
    - Restoring the ability of filters/tests can have same file
      base name but different tests/filters defined inside.
    - Reword the error message when the module fails to parse
      parameters in JSON format (#81188).
    - Reword warning if the reserved keyword _ansible_ used as a
      module parameter (#82514).
    - Run all handlers with the same listen topic, even when
      notified from another handler (#82363).
    - Slight optimization to hostvars (instantiate template only
      once per host, vs per call to var).
    - Stopped misleadingly advertising async mode support in the
      reboot module (#71517).
    - ansible-galaxy role import - fix using the role_name in a
      standalone role's galaxy_info metadata by disabling automatic
      removal of the ansible-role- prefix. This matches the
      behavior of the Galaxy UI which also no longer implicitly
      removes the ansible-role- prefix. Use the --role-name option
      or add a role_name to the galaxy_info dictionary in the
      role's meta/main.yml to use an alternate role name.
    - ansible-test sanity --test runtime-metadata - add
      action_plugin as a valid field for modules in the schema
      (#82562).
    - ansible.module_utils.service - ensure binary data
      transmission in daemonize()

    - ansible.builtin.apt - calling clean = true does not properly
      clean certain cache files such as /var/cache/apt/pkgcache.bin
      and /var/cache/apt/pkgcache.bin (#82611)
    - ansible.builtin.uri - the module was ignoring the force
      parameter and always requesting a cached copy (via the

    - copy action now also generates temprary files as hidden ('.'
      prefixed) to avoid accidental pickup by running services that
      glob by extension.
    - copy action now ensures that tempfiles use the same suffix as
      destination, to allow for validate to work with utilities
      that check extensions.

      default when explicitly used, and is used for all supported
      operations (#82616)
    - dnf5 - replace removed API calls
    - dnf5 - respect allow_downgrade when installing packages
      directly from rpm files

      Characters to syslog with Python 3.12.
    - systemd_services - update documentation regarding
      required_one_of and required_by parameters (#82914).
    - template - Fix error when templating an unsafe string which
      corresponds to an invalid type in Python (#82600).
    - template action will also inherit the behavior from copy (as
      it uses it internally).
    - templating - ensure syntax errors originating from a template
      being compiled into Python code object result in a failure
      (#82606)

    - unsafe data - Enable directly using AnsibleUnsafeText with
      Python pathlib (#82414)
    - uri - update the documentation for follow_redirects.
    - uri action plugin now skipped during check mode (not
      supported) instead of even trying to execute the module,
      which already skipped, this does not really change the
      result, but returns much faster.
    - vars - handle exception while combining VarsWithSources and
      dict (#81659).
    - wait_for should not handle 'non mmapable files' again.

- update to 2.16.8:
  https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/v2.16.8/changelogs/CHANGELOG-v2.16.rst
  * Minor Changes
    - ansible-test - Update pypi-test-container to version 3.1.0.
  * Bugfixes
    - Fix the task attribute resolved_action to show the FQCN
      instead of None when action or local_action is used in the
      playbook.
    - Fix using module_defaults with local_action/action (#81905).
    - fixed unit test test_borken_cowsay to address mock not been
      properly applied when existing unix system already have

      delete one of these temporary directories will result in a
      warning rather than an outright failure.

      able to locate a file in tasks/ when tasks_from was used as a
      role entry point and main.yml was not present (#82241)
    - Plugin loader does not dedupe nor cache filter/test plugins
      by file basename, but full path name.
    - Restoring the ability of filters/tests can have same file
      base name but different tests/filters defined inside.
    - ansible-pull now will expand relative paths for the
      -d|--directory option is now expanded before use.

  https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/v2.16.0/changelogs/CHANGELOG-v2.16.rst
  * Bugfixes and Minor changes omitted for brevity, see full
    changelog
  * Breaking Changes / Porting Guide
    - Any plugin using the config system and the cli entry to use
      the timeout from the command line, will see the value change
      if the use had configured it in any of the lower precedence
      methods. If relying on this behaviour to consume the
      global/generic timeout from the DEFAULT_TIMEOUT constant,
      please consult the documentation on plugin configuration to
      add the overlaping entries.
    - ansible-test - Test plugins that rely on containers no longer
      support reusing running containers. The previous behavior was
      an undocumented, untested feature.
    - service module will not permanently configure variables/flags
      for openbsd when doing enable/disable operation anymore, this
      module was never meant to do this type of work, just to
      manage the service state itself. A rcctl_config or similar
      module should be created and used instead.
  * Deprecated Features
    - Deprecated ini config option collections_paths, use the
      singular form collections_path instead
    - Deprecated the env var ANSIBLE_COLLECTIONS_PATHS, use the
      singular form ANSIBLE_COLLECTIONS_PATH instead
    - Old style vars plugins which use the entrypoints
      get_host_vars or get_group_vars are deprecated. The plugin
      should be updated to inherit from BaseVarsPlugin and define a
      get_vars method as the entrypoint.
    - Support for Windows Server 2012 and 2012 R2 has been removed
      as the support end of life from Microsoft is October 10th
      2023. These versions of Windows will no longer be tested in
      this Ansible release and it cannot be guaranteed that they
      will continue to work going forward.
    - STRING_CONVERSION_ACTION config option is deprecated as it is
      no longer used in the Ansible Core code base.
    - the 'smart' option for setting a connection plugin is being
      removed as it's main purpose (choosing between ssh and
      paramiko) is now irrelevant.
    - vault and unfault filters - the undocumented vaultid
      parameter is deprecated and will be removed in ansible-core
      2.20. Use vault_id instead.
    - yum_repository - deprecated parameter 'keepcache' (#78693).
  * Removed Features (previously deprecated)
    - ActionBase - remove deprecated _remote_checksum method
    - PlayIterator - remove deprecated cache_block_tasks and
      get_original_task methods
    - Remove deprecated FileLock class
    - Removed Python 3.9 as a supported version on the controller.
      Python 3.10 or newer is required.
    - Removed include which has been deprecated in Ansible 2.12.
      Use include_tasks or import_tasks instead.
    - Templar - remove deprecated shared_loader_obj parameter of
      __init__
    - fetch_url - remove auto disabling decompress when gzip is not
      available
    - get_action_args_with_defaults - remove deprecated
      redirected_names method parameter
    - ansible-test - Removed support for the remote Windows targets
      2012 and 2012-R2
    - inventory_cache - remove deprecated
      default.fact_caching_prefix ini configuration option, use
      defaults.fact_caching_prefix instead.
    - module_utils/basic.py - Removed Python 3.5 as a supported
      remote version. Python 2.7 or Python 3.6+ is now required.
    - stat - removed unused get_md5 parameter.
  * Security Fixes
    - ansible-galaxy - Prevent roles from using symlinks to
      overwrite files outside of the installation directory
      (CVE-2023-5115)
  * Known issues
    - ansible-galaxy - dies in the middle of installing a role when
      that role contains Java inner classes (files with $ in the
      file name). This is by design, to exclude temporary or backup
      files. (#81553).
    - ansible-test - The pep8 sanity test is unable to detect
      f-string spacing issues (E201, E202) on Python 3.10 and 3.11.
      They are correctly detected under Python 3.12. See
      (PyCQA/pycodestyle#1190).

- update to 2.15.7:
  This release includes a fix for CVE-2023-5764, where internal
  templating actions could result in unsafe data losing its unsafe
  designation.
  * Breaking Changes / Porting Guide

      cause unsafe variables to lose their unsafe designation
      (CVE-2023-5764)
  * Bugfixes
    - ansible-pull now will expand relative paths for the
      -d|--directory option is now expanded before use.
    - flush_handlers - properly handle a handler failure in a
      nested block when force_handlers is set
      (http://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/81532)
    - module no_log will no longer affect top level booleans, for
      example no_log_module_parameter='a' will no longer hide
      changed=False as a 'no log value' (matches 'a').
    - modules/user.py - Add check for valid directory when creating
      new user homedir (allows /dev/null as skeleton) (#75063)
    - role params now have higher precedence than host facts again,
      matching documentation, this had unintentionally changed in
      2.15.

    - Restoring the ability of filters/tests can have same file
      base name but different tests/filters defined inside.
    - import_role reverts to previous behavior of exporting vars at
      compile time.
    - ansible-galaxy - Provide a better error message when using a
      requirements file with an invalid format - #81901
    - ansible-inventory - index available_hosts for major
      performance boost when dumping large inventories
    - ansible-test - Fix parsing of cgroup entries which contain a
      : in the path (#81977).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct 10 04:44:30 UTC 2023 - Johannes Kastl <kastl@b1-systems.de>

- update to 2.15.5:
  * Minor Changes
    - ansible-galaxy dependency resolution messages have changed
      the unexplained 'virtual' collection for the specific type
      ('scm', 'dir', etc) that is more user friendly
  * Security Fixes
    - ansible-galaxy - Prevent roles from using symlinks to
      overwrite files outside of the installation directory
      (CVE-2023-5115)
  * Bugfixes
    - Allow for searching handler subdir for included task via
      include_role (#81722)
    - PluginLoader - fix Jinja plugin performance issues (#79652)
    - ansible.module_utils.service - ensure binary data
      transmission in daemonize()
    - ansible.module_utils.service - fix inter-process
      communication in daemonize()
    - ansible-galaxy - started allowing the use of pre-releases for
      collections that do not have any stable versions published.
      (#81606)
    - ansible-galaxy - started allowing the use of pre-releases for
      dependencies on any level of the dependency tree that
      specifically demand exact pre-release versions of collections
      and not version ranges. (#81606)
    - ansible-galaxy error on dependency resolution will not error
      itself due to 'virtual' collections not having a
      name/namespace.
    - ansible-galaxy info - fix reporting no role found when
      lookup_role_by_name returns None.
    - role deduplication - don't deduplicate before a role has had
      a task run for that particular host (#81486).
    - uri/urls - Add compat function to handle the ability to parse
      the filename from a Content-Disposition header (#81806)
    - winrm - Better handle send input failures when communicating

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep 12 08:13:53 UTC 2023 - Johannes Kastl <kastl@b1-systems.de>

- update to 2.15.4:
  * Deprecated Features
    - vault and unfault filters - the undocumented vaultid
      parameter is deprecated and will be removed in ansible-core
      2.20. Use vault_id instead.
  * Bugfixes
    - PowerShell - Remove some code which is no longer valid for
      dotnet 5+
    - Prompting - add a short sleep between polling for user input
      to reduce CPU consumption (#81516).
    - ansible-galaxy - Enabled the data tarfile filter during role
      installation for Python versions that support it. A probing
      mechanism is used to avoid Python versions with a broken
      implementation.
    - ansible-test - Always use ansible-test managed entry points
      for ansible-core CLI tools when not running from source. This
      fixes issues where CLI entry points created during install
      are not compatible with ansible-test.
    - first found lookup has been updated to use the normalized
      argument parsing (pythonic) matching the documented examples.
    - handlers - the listen keyword can affect only one handler
      with the same name, the last one defined as it is a case with
      the notify keyword (#81013)
    - include_role - expose variables from parent roles to role's
      handlers (#80459)
    - tarfile - handle data filter deprecation warning message for

      parameter.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep  6 06:19:18 UTC 2023 - Johannes Kastl <kastl@b1-systems.de>

- as example files were split out into a separate package
  ansible-documentation upstream, this package now Recommends that
  package
- update to 2.15.3:
  * Minor Changes
    - Removed exclude and recursive-exclude commands for generated
      files from the MANIFEST.in file. These excludes were
      unnecessary since releases are expected to be built with a
      clean worktree.
    - Removed exclude commands for sanity test files from the
      MANIFEST.in file. These tests were previously excluded
      because they did not pass when run from an sdist. However,
      sanity tests are not expected to pass from an sdist, so
      excluding some (but not all) of the failing tests makes
      little sense.
    - Removed redundant include commands from the MANIFEST.in file.
      These includes either duplicated default behavior or another
      command.
    - The ansible-core sdist no longer contains pre-generated man
      pages. Instead, a packaging/cli-doc/build.py script is
      included in the sdist. This script can generate man pages and
      standalone RST documentation for ansible-core CLI programs.
    - The docs and examples directories are no longer included in
      the ansible-core sdist. These directories have been moved to
      the https://github.com/ansible/ansible-documentation
      repository.
    - Use include where recursive-include is unnecessary in the
      MANIFEST.in file.
    - ansible-test - Update the logic used to detect when
      ansible-test is running from source.
    - ansible-test - Updated the CloudStack test container to
      version 1.6.1.
  * Bugfixes
    - Exclude internal options from man pages and docs.
    - Fix ansible-config init man page option indentation.
    - The ansible-config init command now has a documentation
      description.
    - The ansible-galaxy collection download command now has a
      documentation description.
    - The ansible-galaxy collection install command documentation
      is now visible (previously hidden by a decorator).
    - The ansible-galaxy collection verify command now has a
      documentation description.
    - The ansible-galaxy role install command documentation is now
      visible (previously hidden by a decorator).
    - The ansible-inventory command command now has a documentation
      description (previously used as the epilog).
    - Update module_utils.urls unit test to work with cryptography
      >= 41.0.0.
    - When generating man pages, use func to find the command
      function instead of looking it up by the command name.
    - ansible-galaxy now considers all collection paths when
      identifying which collection requirements are already
      installed. Use the COLLECTIONS_PATHS and
      COLLECTIONS_SCAN_SYS_PATHS config options to modify these.
      Previously only the install path was considered when
      resolving the candidates. The install path will remain the
      only one potentially modified. (#79767, #81163)
    - ansible-test - Fix several possible tracebacks when using the
      -e option with sanity tests.
    - ansible-test - Pre-build a PyYAML wheel before installing
      requirements to avoid a potential Cython build failure.
    - ansible-test - Remove redundant warning about missing
      programs before attempting to execute them.
    - core will now also look at the connection plugin to force
      'local' interpreter for networking path compatibility as just
      ansible_network_os could be misleading.
    - man page build - Sub commands of ansible-galaxy role and
      ansible-galaxy collection are now documented.
    - password_hash - fix salt format for crypt (only used if
      passlib is not installed) for the bcrypt algorithm.
    - urls.py - fixed cert_file and key_file parameters when
      running on Python 3.12 - #80490

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul 18 05:02:29 UTC 2023 - Johannes Kastl <kastl@b1-systems.de>

- update to 2.15.2:
  * Minor Changes
    - Utilize gpg check provided internally by the transaction.run
      method as oppose to calling it manually.
    - ansible-test - Add Fedora 38 remote.
    - ansible-test - Use a context manager to perform cleanup at
      exit instead of using the built-in atexit module.
    - dnf5 - enable environment groups installation testing in CI
      as its support was added.
    - dnf5 - enable now implemented cacheonly functionality
  * Bugfixes
    - From issue #80880, when notifying a handler from another
      handler, handler notifications must be registered immediately
      as the flush_handler call is not recursive.
    - ansible-galaxy - Fix issue installing collections containing
      directories with more than 100 characters on python versions
      before 3.10.6
    - paramiko_ssh, psrp, and ssh connection plugins - ensure that
      all values for options that should be strings are actually
      converted to strings (#81029).
    - templating - In the template action and lookup, use local
      jinja2 environment overlay overrides instead of mutating the
      templars environment
  * Known Issues
    - ansible-test - The Fedora 37 remote is known to occasionally
      hang during boot. It is no longer routinely tested as a
      result. If possible, use the Fedora 38 remote instead.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun 21 04:46:09 UTC 2023 - Johannes Kastl <kastl@b1-systems.de>

- update to 2.15.1:
  * Minor Changes
    - ansible-test - Allow float values for the --timeout option to
      the env command. This simplifies testing.
    - ansible-test - Refactored env command logic and timeout
      handling.
    - ansible-test - Use datetime.datetime.now with tz specified
      instead of datetime.datetime.utcnow.
  * Bugfixes
    - Properly disable jinja2_native in the template module when
      jinja2 override is used in the template (#80605)
    - ansible-galaxy - Fix variable type error when installing
      subdir collections (#80943)
    - ansible-test - Fix a traceback that occurs when attempting to

      error message is now given when this scenario occurs.
    - ansible-test - Fix handling of timeouts exceeding one day.
    - ansible-test - Fix various cases where the test timeout could
      expire without terminating the tests.
    - ansible-test local change detection - use git merge-base
      <branch> HEAD instead of git merge-base --fork-point <branch>
      (#79734).
    - deb822_repository - use http-agent for receiving content
      (#80809).
    - dnf5 - Update dnf5 module to handle API change for setting
      the download directory (#80887)
    - man page build - Remove the dependency on the docs directory
      for building man pages.
    - pep517 build backend - Copy symlinks when copying the source
      tree. This avoids tracebacks in various scenarios, such as
      when a venv is present in the source tree.
    - uri - fix search for JSON type to include complex strings
      containing '+'

- update to 2.14.5:
  https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/v2.14.5/changelogs/
  CHANGELOG-v2.14.rst
  * Bugfixes
    - ansible-doc - stop generating wrong module URLs for module
      see-alsos. The URLs for modules in ansible.builtin do now
      work, and URLs for modules outside ansible.builtin are no
      longer added (#80280).
    - ansible-galaxy - Improve retries for collection installs, to
      properly retry, and extend retry logic to common URL related
      connection errors (#80170 #80174)
    - ansible-galaxy - reduce API calls to servers by fetching
      signatures only for final candidates.
    - ansible-test - Add support for argcomplete version 3.
    - jinja2_native - fix intermittent 'could not find job'
      failures when a value of ansible_job_id from a result of an
      async task was inadvertently changed during execution; to
      prevent this a format of ansible_job_id was changed.
    - password lookup now correctly reads stored ident fields.
    - pep517 build backend - Use the documented import_module
      import from importlib.
    - roles - Fix templating public, allow_duplicates and
      rolespec_validate (#80304).
    - syntax check - Limit --syntax-check to ansible-playbook only,
      as that is the only CLI affected by this argument (#80506)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 28 06:24:00 UTC 2023 - Johannes Kastl <kastl@b1-systems.de>

- use `with` in dependencies instead of `and`
- update to 2.14.4:
  https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/v2.14.4/changelogs/
  CHANGELOG-v2.14.rst
  * Minor Changes
    - ansible-test - Moved git handling out of the validate-modules
      sanity test and into ansible-test.
    - ansible-test - Removed the --keep-git sanity test option,
      which was limited to testing ansible-core itself.
    - ansible-test - Updated the Azure Pipelines CI plugin to work
      with newer versions of git.
  * Breaking Changes / Porting Guide
    - ansible-test - Integration tests which depend on specific
      file permissions when running in an ansible-test managed
      host environment may require changes. Tests that require
      permissions other than 755 or 644 may need to be updated to
      set the necessary permissions as part of the test run.
  * Bugfixes
    - Fix MANIFEST.in to exclude unwanted files in the packaging/
      directory.
    - Fix MANIFEST.in to include `*.md` files in the test/support/
      directory.
    - Fix an issue where the value of become was ignored when used
      on a role used as a dependency in main/meta.yml (#79777)

      tests/integration/target-prefixes.{group} file can now
      contain an underscore (`_`) character. Resolves issue #79225
    - ansible-test - Removed pointless comparison in diff
      evaluation logic.
    - ansible-test - Set PYLINTHOME for the pylint sanity test to
      prevent failures due to pylint checking for the existence of
      an obsolete home directory.
    - ansible-test - Support loading of vendored Python packages
      from ansible-core.
    - ansible-test - Use consistent file permissions when
      delegating tests to a container or remote host. Files with
      any execute bit set will use permissions 755. All other
      files will use permissions 644. (Resolves issue #75079)
    - copy - fix creating the dest directory in check mode with
      remote_src=True (#78611).
    - copy - fix reporting changes to file attributes in check mode
      with remote_src=True (#77957).

Tue Jan 31 15:08:40 UTC 2023 - Johannes Kastl <kastl@b1-systems.de>

- update to 2.14.2:
  Full changelog https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/v2.14.2/changelogs/CHANGELOG-v2.14.rst
  * Major Changes
    - ansible-test - Docker Desktop on WSL2 is now supported (additional configuration required).
    - ansible-test - Docker and Podman are now supported on hosts with cgroup v2 unified. Previously only cgroup v1 and cgroup v2 hybrid were supported.
    - ansible-test - Podman now works on container hosts without systemd. Previously only some containers worked, while others required rootfull or rootless Podman, but would not work with both. Some containers did not work at all.
    - ansible-test - Podman on WSL2 is now supported.
    - ansible-test - When additional cgroup setup is required on the container host, this will be automatically detected. Instructions on how to configure the host will be provided in the error message shown.
  * Minor Changes
    - ansible-test - A new audit option is available when running custom containers. This option can be used to indicate whether a container requires the AUDIT_WRITE capability. The default is required, which most containers will need when using Podman. If necessary, the none option can be used to opt-out of the capability. This has no effect on Docker, which always provides the capability.
    - ansible-test - A new cgroup option is available when running custom containers. This option can be used to indicate a container requires cgroup v1 or that it does not use cgroup. The default behavior assumes the container works with cgroup v2 (as well as v1).
    - ansible-test - Additional log details are shown when containers fail to start or SSH connections to containers fail.
    - ansible-test - Connection failures to remote provisioned hosts now show failure details as a warning.
    - ansible-test - Containers included with ansible-test no longer disable seccomp by default.
    - ansible-test - Failure to connect to a container over SSH now results in a clear error. Previously tests would be attempted even after initial connection attempts failed.
    - ansible-test - Integration tests can be excluded from retries triggered by the --retry-on-error option by adding the retry/never alias. This is useful for tests that cannot pass on a retry or are too slow to make retries useful.
    - ansible-test - More details are provided about an instance when provisioning fails.
    - ansible-test - Reduce the polling limit for SSHD startup in containers from 60 retries to 10. The one second delay between retries remains in place.
    - ansible-test - SSH connections from OpenSSH 8.8+ to CentOS 6 containers now work without additional configuration. However, clients older than OpenSSH 7.0 can no longer connect to CentOS 6 containers as a result. The container must have centos6 in the image name for this work-around to be applied.
    - ansible-test - SSH shell connections from OpenSSH 8.8+ to ansible-test provisioned network instances now work without additional configuration. However, clients older than OpenSSH 7.0 can no longer open shell sessions for ansible-test provisioned network instances as a result.
    - ansible-test - The ansible-test env command now detects and reports the container ID if running in a container.
    - ansible-test - Unit tests now support network disconnect by default when running under Podman. Previously this feature only worked by default under Docker.
    - ansible-test - Use stop --time 0 followed by rm to remove ephemeral containers instead of rm -f. This speeds up teardown of ephemeral containers.
    - ansible-test - Warnings are now shown when using containers that were built with VOLUME instructions.
    - ansible-test - When setting the max open files for containers, the container host's limit will be checked. If the host limit is lower than the preferred value, it will be used and a warning will be shown.
    - ansible-test - When using Podman, ansible-test will detect if the loginuid used in containers is incorrect. When this occurs a warning is displayed and the container is run with the AUDIT_CONTROL capability. Previously containers would fail under this situation, with no useful warnings or errors given.
  * Bugfixes
    - Correctly count rescued tasks in play recap (#79711)
    - Fix traceback when using the template module and running with ANSIBLE_DEBUG=1 (#79763)
    - Fix using GALAXY_IGNORE_CERTS in conjunction with collections in requirements files which specify a specific source that isn't in the configured servers.
    - Fix using GALAXY_IGNORE_CERTS when downloading tarballs from Galaxy servers (#79557).
    - Module and role argument validation - include the valid suboption choices in the error when an invalid suboption is provided.
    - ansible-doc now will correctly display short descriptions on listing filters/tests no matter the directory sorting.
    - ansible-inventory will not explicitly sort groups/hosts anymore, giving a chance (depending on output format) to match the order in the input sources.
    - ansible-test - Added a work-around for a traceback under Python 3.11 when completing certain command line options.
    - ansible-test - Avoid using exec after container startup when possible. This improves container startup performance and avoids intermittent startup issues with some old containers.
    - ansible-test - Connection attempts to managed remote instances no longer abort on Permission denied errors.
    - ansible-test - Detection for running in a Podman or Docker container has been fixed to detect more scenarios. The new detection relies on /proc/self/mountinfo instead of /proc/self/cpuset. Detection now works with custom cgroups and private cgroup namespaces.
    - ansible-test - Fix validate-modules error when retrieving PowerShell argspec when retrieved inside a Cmdlet
    - ansible-test - Handle server errors when executing the docker info command.
    - ansible-test - Multiple containers now work under Podman without specifying the --docker-network option.
    - ansible-test - Pass the XDG_RUNTIME_DIR environment variable through to container commands.
    - ansible-test - Perform PyPI proxy configuration after instances are ready and bootstrapping has been completed. Only target instances are affected, as controller instances were already handled this way. This avoids proxy configuration errors when target instances are not yet ready for use.
    - ansible-test - Prevent concurrent / repeat inspections of the same container image.
    - ansible-test - Prevent concurrent / repeat pulls of the same container image.
    - ansible-test - Prevent concurrent execution of cached methods.
    - ansible-test - Show the exception type when reporting errors during instance provisioning.
    - ansible-test sanity - correctly report invalid YAML in validate-modules (#75837).
    - argument spec validation - again report deprecated parameters for Python-based modules. This was accidentally removed in ansible-core 2.11 when argument spec validation was refactored (#79680, #79681).
    - argument spec validation - ensure that deprecated aliases in suboptions are also reported (#79740).
    - argument spec validation - fix warning message when two aliases of the same option are used for suboptions to also mention the option's name they are in (#79740).
    - connection local now avoids traceback on invalid user being used to execuet ansible (valid in host, but not in container).
    - file - touch action in check mode was always returning ok. Fix now evaluates the different conditions and returns the appropriate changed status. (#79360)
    - get_url - Ensure we are passing ciphers to all url_get calls (#79717)
    - plugin filter now works with rejectlist as documented (still falls back to blacklist if used).
    - uri - improve JSON content type detection
  * Known Issues
    - ansible-test - Additional configuration may be required for certain container host and container combinations. Further details are available in the testing documentation.
    - ansible-test - Custom containers with VOLUME instructions may be unable to start, when previously the containers started correctly. Remove the VOLUME instructions to resolve the issue. Containers with this condition will cause ansible-test to emit a warning.
    - ansible-test - Systems with Podman networking issues may be unable to run containers, when previously the issue went unreported. Correct the networking issues to continue using ansible-test with Podman.
    - ansible-test - Using Docker on systems with SELinux may require setting SELinux to permissive mode. Podman should work with SELinux in enforcing mode.

- update to 2.13.3:
  Changelog https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/v2.13.3/changelogs/CHANGELOG-v2.13.rst
  * Bugfixes
    - Avoid 'unreachable' error when chmod on AIX has 255 as return code.
    - Fix PluginLoader to mimic Python import machinery by adding module to sys.modules before exec
    - Fix dnf module documentation to indicate that comparison operators for package version require spaces around them (#78295)
    - ansible-connection - decrypt vaulted parameters before sending over the socket, as vault secrets are not available on the other side.
    - ansible-galaxy - Fix reinitializing the whole collection directory with ansible-galaxy collection init ns.coll --force. Now directories and files that are not included in the collection skeleton will be removed.
    - ansible-galaxy - do not require mandatory keys in the galaxy.yml of source collections when listing them (#70180).
    - ansible-galaxy - fix listing collections that contains metadata but the namespace or name are not strings.
    - ansible-galaxy - fix setting the cache for paginated responses from Galaxy NG/AH (#77911).
    - ansible-test - Delegation for commands which generate output for programmatic consumption no longer redirect all output to stdout. The affected commands and options are shell, sanity --lint, sanity --list-tests, integration --list-targets, coverage analyze
    - ansible-test - Delegation now properly handles arguments given after -- on the command line.
    - ansible-test - Test configuration for collections is now parsed only once, prior to delegation. Fixes issue: #78334
    - ansible-test - The shell command no longer redirects all output to stdout when running a provided command. Any command output written to stderr will be mixed with the stderr output from ansible-test.
    - ansible-test - The shell command no longer requests a TTY when using delegation unless an interactive shell is being used. An interactive shell is the default behavior when no command is given to pass to the shell.
    - dnf - fix output parsing on systems with LANGUAGE set to a language other than English (#78193)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul 20 06:46:22 UTC 2022 - Johannes Kastl <kastl@b1-systems.de>

- update to 2.13.2:
  * Minor Changes
    - ansible-test - An improved error message is shown when the download of a pip bootstrap script fails. The download now uses urllib2 instead of urllib on Python 2.
  * Bugfixes
    - Move undefined check from concat to finalize (#78156)
    - ansible-doc - no longer list module and plugin aliases that are created with symlinks (#78137).
    - ansible-doc - when listing modules in collections, proceed recursively. This fixes module listing for community.general 5.x.y and community.network 4.x.y (#78137).
    - ansible-doc will not add 'website for' in ":ref:" substitutions as it made them confusing.
    - file backed cache plugins now handle concurrent access by making atomic updates to the files.
    - password lookup does not ignore k=v arguments anymore.
    - user - Fix error "Permission denied" in user module while generating SSH keys (#78017).

- update to 2.13.1:
  * Minor Changes
    - Add an 'action_plugin' field for modules in runtime.yml plugin_routing.
      This fixes module_defaults by supporting modules-as-redirected-actions without redirecting module_defaults entries to the common action.
      With the runtime.yml above for ns.coll, a task such as
      will end up with defaults for eos_facts and eos_command since both modules redirect to the same action.
      To select an action plugin for a module without merging module_defaults, define an action_plugin field for the resolved module in the runtime.yml.
      The action_plugin field can be a redirected action plugin, as it is resolved normally.
      Using the modified runtime.yml, the example task will only use the ns.coll.eos_facts defaults.
    - ansible-galaxy - Support resolvelib versions 0.6.x, 0.7.x, and 0.8.x. The full range of supported versions is now >= 0.5.3, < 0.9.0.
    - ansible-test - Add RHEL 9.0 remote support.
    - ansible-test - Add support for Ubuntu VMs using the --remote option.
    - ansible-test - Add support for exporting inventory with ansible-test shell --export {path}.
    - ansible-test - Add support for multi-arch remotes.
    - ansible-test - Add support for running non-interactive commands with ansible-test shell.
    - ansible-test - Avoid using the mock_use_standalone_module setting for unit tests running on Python 3.8 or later.
    - ansible-test - Blocking mode is now enforced for stdin, stdout and stderr. If any of these are non-blocking then ansible-test will exit during startup with an error.
    - ansible-test - Improve consistency of output messages by using stdout or stderr for most output, but not both.
    - ansible-test - The shell command can be used outside a collection if no controller delegation is required.
  * Bugfixes
    - Add PyYAML >= 5.1 as a dependency of ansible-core to be compatible with Python 3.8+.
    - ansible-config dump - Only display plugin type headers when plugin options are changed if --only-changed is specified.
    - ansible-galaxy - handle unsupported versions of resolvelib gracefully.
    - ansible-test - Fix internal validation of remote completion configuration.
    - ansible-test - Prevent --target- prefixed options for the shell command from being combined with legacy environment options.
    - ansible-test - Sanity test output with the --lint option is no longer mixed in with bootstrapping output.
    - ansible-test - Subprocesses are now isolated from the stdin, stdout and stderr of ansible-test. This avoids issues with subprocesses tampering with the file descriptors, such as SSH making them non-blocking. As a result of this change, subprocess output from unit and integration tests on stderr now go to stdout.
    - ansible-test - Subprocesses no longer have access to the TTY ansible-test is connected to, if any. This maintains consistent behavior between local testing and CI systems, which typically do not provide a TTY. Tests which require a TTY should use pexpect or another mechanism to create a PTY.
    - apt module now correctly handles virtual packages.
    - lookup plugin - catch KeyError when lookup returns dictionary (#77789).
    - pip - fix cases where resolution of pip Python module fails when importlib.util has not already been imported
    - plugin loader - Sort results when fuzzy matching plugin names (#77966).
    - plugin loader will now load config data for plugin by name instead of by file to avoid issues with the same file being loaded under different names (fqcn + short name).
    - psrp connection now handles default to inventory_hostname correctly.
    - winrm connection now handles default to inventory_hostname correctly.

- update to 2.13.0:
  Full changelog see
  https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/stable-2.13/changelogs/CHANGELOG-v2.13.rst#v2130

- update to 2.12.7:
  * Minor Changes
    - Add an 'action_plugin' field for modules in runtime.yml plugin_routing.
      This fixes module_defaults by supporting modules-as-redirected-actions without redirecting module_defaults entries to the common action.
      With the runtime.yml above for ns.coll, a task such as
      will end up with defaults for eos_facts and eos_command since both modules redirect to the same action.
      To select an action plugin for a module without merging module_defaults, define an action_plugin field for the resolved module in the runtime.yml.
      The action_plugin field can be a redirected action plugin, as it is resolved normally.
      Using the modified runtime.yml, the example task will only use the ns.coll.eos_facts defaults.
    - ansible-test - Avoid using the mock_use_standalone_module setting for unit tests running on Python 3.8 or later.
  * Bugfixes
    - pip - fix cases where resolution of pip Python module fails when importlib.util has not already been imported
    - plugin loader - Sort results when fuzzy matching plugin names (#77966).

- update to 2.12.6:
  * Bugfixes
    - Prevent losing unsafe on results returned from lookups (#77535)
    - arg_spec - Fix incorrect no_log warning when a parameter alias is used (#77576)
    - plugin loader will now load config data for plugin by name instead of by file to avoid issues with the same file being loaded under different names (fqcn + short name).
    - variablemanager, more efficient read of vars files

- update to 2.12.5:
  * Bugfixes
    - Ansible.ModuleUtils.SID - Use user principal name as is for lookup in the Convert-ToSID function - #77316
    - Fix traceback when installing a collection from a git repository and git is not installed (#77479).
    - ansible-test - Correctly detect when running as the root user (UID 0) on the origin host. The result of the detection was incorrectly being inverted.
    - ansible-test - Fix skipping of tests marked needs/python on the origin host.
    - ansible-test - Fix skipping of tests marked needs/root on the origin host.
    - ansible-test compile sanity test - do not crash if a column could not be determined for an error (#77465).
    - hostname - use file_get_content() to read the file containing the host name in the FileStrategy.get_permanent_hostname() method. This prevents a TypeError from being raised when the strategy is used (#77025).
    - script - skip in check mode since the plugin cannot determine if a change will occur.
    - shell/command - only skip in check mode if the options creates and removes are both None.
    - winrm - Ensure kinit is run with the same PATH env var as the Ansible process
