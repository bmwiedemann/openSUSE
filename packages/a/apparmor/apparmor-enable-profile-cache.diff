Enable caching of profiles.

This speeds up loading the (unchanged) profiles about 20 times.

Upstream doesn't enable caching because the cache directory is not
writeable at the time profiles are loaded in Ubuntu.

See also bnc#689458


Also set the cache location to /var/cache/apparmor/ (writeable) and
/usr/share/apparmor/cache/ (packaged precompiled cache).
