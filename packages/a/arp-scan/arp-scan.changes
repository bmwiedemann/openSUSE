- update to 1.9.8:
  - Allow the use of Linux IP aliases such as eth0:0 for the interface name.
  - Permit regular MAC addresses e.g. 00:0c:29:b9:43:1b in mac-vendor.txt.
  - --limit=n option exits after n of hosts have responded, exit 1 for <n
  - --resolve option to resolve responding IP addresses to hostnames
  - Potential buffer overrun in unmarshal_arp_pkt().
  - arp-scan aborts with EAGAIN on busy network or using high bandwidth
  - late ARP responses could sometimes be incorrectly flagged as duplicate
  - Updated IEEE URLs in download perl scripts.
  - Updated source for Mersenne RNG and replacement strlcat/strlcpy & getopt.
  - Updated for compatability with autoconf 2.71
  - "make distcheck" works now
  - Number of responding hosts reported no longer counts duplicate packets.
  - Many typos corrected and edge cases fixed.
  - CI framework migrated from travis-ci to github actions.
  - Several new tests for "make check"

- Update to version 1.9.7:
  * Internal changes only

Fri Oct 25 08:20:19 UTC 2019 - Martin Pluskal <mpluskal@suse.com>

- Update to version 1.9.6 (boo#1154552):
  * Use libpcap function pcap_set_immediate_mode() instead of ioctl
    calls to ensure packets are delivered immediately. This means
    that arp-scan now requires libpcap 1.5.0 or later and will
    not work with earlier libpcap versions

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar  5 10:49:51 UTC 2019 - Martin Pluskal <mpluskal@suse.com>

- Update to version 1.9.5:
  * Updated IEEE OUI and IAB MAC/Vendor files.
  * Added new --plain (-x) option to surpress printing of header
    and footer text, and only display one output line for each
    responding host.
  * Use LWP::UserAgent instead of LWP::Simple in get-oui and
    get-iab to enable the raw content to be obtained, which avoids
    Unicode/UTF-8 issues.
  * Added arp-finherprint patterns for WIZnet W5100 and Cisco IOS
    15.0.
