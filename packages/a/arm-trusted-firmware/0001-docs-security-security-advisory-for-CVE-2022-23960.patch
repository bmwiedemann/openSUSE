+
+This security advisory describes the current understanding of the Trusted
+Firmware-A exposure to the new speculative processor vulnerability.
+To understand the background and wider impact of these vulnerabilities on Arm
+systems, please refer to the `Arm Processor Security Update`_. The whitepaper
+referred to below describes the Spectre attack and mitigation in more detail
+including implementation specific mitigation details for all impacted Arm CPUs.
+
+
+`CVE-2022-23960`_
+-----------------
+
+Where possible on vulnerable CPUs that implement FEAT_CSV2, Arm recommends
+inserting a loop workaround with implementation specific number of iterations
+that will discard the branch history on exception entry to a higher exception
+level for the given CPU. This is done as early as possible on entry into EL3,
+before any branch instruction is executed. This is sufficient to mitigate
+Spectre-BHB on behalf of all secure world code, assuming that no secure world
+code is under attacker control.
+
+The below table lists the CPUs that mitigate against this vulnerability in
+TF-A using the loop workaround(all cores that implement FEAT_CSV2 except the
+revisions of Cortex-A73 and Cortex-A75 that implements FEAT_CSV2).
+
++----------------------+
+| Core                 |
++----------------------+
+| Cortex-A72(from r1p0)|
++----------------------+
+| Cortex-A76           |
++----------------------+
+| Cortex-A77           |
++----------------------+
+| Cortex-A78           |
++----------------------+
+| Cortex-X2            |
++----------------------+
+| Cortex-A710          |
++----------------------+
+| Neoverse-N1          |
++----------------------+
+| Neoverse-N2          |
++----------------------+
+| Neoverse-V1          |
++----------------------+
+
+For all other cores impacted by Spectre-BHB, some of which that do not implement
+FEAT_CSV2 and some that do e.g. Cortex-A73, the recommended mitigation is to
+flush all branch predictions via an implementation specific route.
+
+In case local workaround is not feasible, the Rich OS can invoke the SMC
+(``SMCCC_ARCH_WORKAROUND_3``) to apply the workaround. Refer to `SMCCC Calling
+Convention specification`_ for more details.
+
+`Gerrit topic #spectre_bhb`_ This patchset implements the Spectre-BHB loop
+workaround for CPUs mentioned in the above table. It also mitigates against
+this vulnerability for Cortex-A72 CPU versions that support the CSV2 feature
+(from r1p0). The patch stack also includes an implementation for a specified
+`CVE-2022-23960`_ workaround SMC(``SMCCC_ARCH_WORKAROUND_3``) for use by normal
+world privileged software. Details of ``SMCCC_ARCH_WORKAROUND_3`` can be found
+in the `SMCCC Calling Convention specification`_. The specification and
+implementation also enables the normal world to discover the presence of this
+firmware service. This patch also implements ``SMCCC_ARCH_WORKAROUND_3`` for
+Cortex-A57, Coxtex-A72, Cortex-A73 and Cortex-A75 using the existing workaround.
+for CVE-2017-5715.
+
+The above workaround is enabled by default (on vulnerable CPUs only). Platforms
+can choose to disable them at compile time if they do not require them.
+
+For more information about non-Arm CPUs, please contact the CPU vendor.
