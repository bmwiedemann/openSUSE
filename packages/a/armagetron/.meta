  <title>OpenGL Game Similar to the Film Tron</title>
  <description>In this game, race against other players on a permanently moving
lightcycle (virtual motorbike), which leaves a wall as a trace. The
lightcycles can make 90 degree turns and accelerate when driven close
to walls. The game is over if you hit a wall. The goal of the game is
to try to make your enemies hit the walls, while you avoid doing the
same. Unlike glTron, this program does not require 3D hardware support.</description>
