%description
This package provides a collection of Ansible Playbooks for SAP Automation,  designed to automate the setup and configuration of SAP environments.

The playbooks are installed in the following directory: /usr/share/ansible/playbooks/ansible.playbooks_for_sap/

IMPORTANT: Do not modify the playbooks in this directory directly. Any changes will be overwritten by future package updates (zypper up).
Instead, copy the playbooks to a different location before customizing or using them.

It is highly recommended to read the README file in the installation directory to understand the functionality and proper usage of the playbooks.
