%description
The AWS SDK for C++ provides a modern C++ (version C++ 11 or later) interface for
Amazon Web Services (AWS). It is meant to be performant and fully functioning with
low- and high-level SDKs, while minimizing dependencies and providing platform
portability (Windows, OSX, Linux, and mobile).

%package bin
Summary:        AWS C++ wrapper for AWS SDK C libraries - application binaries
Group:          Development/Languages/Other

%description bin
AWS C++ wrapper for the following AWS SDK C libraries

 * aws-c-common: Cross-platform primitives and data structures.
 * aws-c-io: Cross-platform event-loops, non-blocking I/O, and TLS implementations.
 * aws-c-mqtt: MQTT client.
 * aws-c-auth: Auth signers such as Aws-auth sigv4
 * aws-c-http: HTTP 1.1 client, and websockets (H2 coming soon)
 * aws-checksums: Cross-Platform HW accelerated CRC32c and CRC32 with fallback to efficient SW implementations.
 * aws-c-event-stream: C99 implementation of the vnd.amazon.event-stream content-type.

This package contains application binaries.
