- Update to version 0.5.11
  + Logging updates
    * Move libcrypto symbol resolution output to logging calls
- from version 0.5.10
  + BYO_CRYPTO updates for Sigv4a
    * Updated some ecc key API functions to have BYO_CRYPTO-conditional implementations
- from version 0.5.9
  + Support in-source build with AWS-LC
    * Instead of always searching for a pre-installed libcrypto, now provide the option
      to use the crypto target to do the link. It's useful for the in-source build, where
      we will not install libcrypto, instead, we build aws-lc (for libcrypto) before building
      aws-c-cal.
- from version 0.5.8
  + SHA1 Hash Support
    * Adding support for SHA1.
- from version 0.5.7
  + Don't run aws-lc's codegen at build time
    * Disable aws-lc's codegen. (#90)
      Background: aws-lc uses codegen to create some of its source files, and it runs these generators
      if the user's machine has Go and Perl installed. However, up-to-date versions of the generated
      files are already committed to the repo, so it's not necessary for users to run codegen on their
      machines. This codegen has led to unexpected issues (ex: failure due to network access at build
      time) so let's just turn it off and reduce unnecessary complexity.
- from version 0.5.6
  + OpenSSL detection fixes
    * OpenSSL/libcrypto fixes and CI (#88)
    * Additional fixes from OpenSSL testing
    * Added diagnostics for libcrypto usage

    * Updated to builder v0.8.14 for variants support
- from version 0.5.5
  + Restored OpenSSL detection and improved robustness
    * Fixes to OpenSSL probing from testing (#87)
    * Fixed static resolution pass to be exhaustive before attempting dynamic pass
    * Made logging consistent between API resolution functions
- from version 0.5.4
  + Fix aws-lc builds when shared libs is ON
    * Propagates the BUILD_SHARED_LIBS settings downstream to the aws-lc build
- from version 0.5.3
  + Improved ECC support
    * Fix some ECC key generation tests
    * Update Windows system dependencies to include Ncrypt to allow for ECC imports
- from version 0.5.2
  + aws-lc.cmake skips libssl, builds only libcrypto
    * aws-lc.cmake skips libssl, builds only libcrypto (#74)
- from version 0.5.1
  + Added Bring your own crypto support for unix platforms.
    * Add CI jobs for shared-libs (#69)
    * Also fix windows-vc14 (x86) job so it actually uses vc14, and actually builds x86
- from version 0.5.0
  + Now using aws-lc instead of libcrypto on UNIX platforms
    * Integration of AWS LC as crypto implementation on UNIX platforms (#67)
    * Make Unix platforms build with AWS-LC
    * Disabled fail-fast on matrix tests
    * Temporarily remove auth downstream until auth is updated
    * Deleted libcrypto depedency:
    * Added aws-lc as dependency
    * Added support for lib64 dirs on RH variants
    * Consume LibCrypto::Crypto the same way s2n does
    * Removed broken shared-libs job
