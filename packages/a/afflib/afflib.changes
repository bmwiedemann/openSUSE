- upgrade to v3.6.15
        * configure.ac: incorporated Greg Freemyer's patch to address some
        ncurses problems.
        * lib/utils.h: created virtual destructore
        * configure.ac: added AC_PROG_CXX
        * tools/affxml.cpp (main): removed unused bflag variable
        * lib/vnode_afd.cpp: max() is now always defined, even on windows.
	* lib/aftimer.h (aftimer::eta_time): added std:: before string
	* lib/utils.h: added virtual destructor for seginfo
	* lib/afflib_pages.cpp (af_get_pagesize): having af_page_size() as
	a macro was causing problems, so now there is both af_page_size
	and af_get_pagesize, both of which do the same. Please use af_get_pagesize.
	* aftimer.h (timestamp): updated aftimer for higher resolution on win32
	* lib/afflib.cpp (af_get_pagesize): created af_get_pagesize, which
	for some reason was missing.
	* lib/afflib.h: added int af_get_pagesize(AFFILE *af);
