  <description>ASCO project aims to bring circuit optimization capabilities to existing SPICE
simulators using a high-performance parallel differential evolution (DE) optimization
algorithm. Currently out-of-the-box support for Eldo (TM), HSPICE (R), LTspice (TM),
Spectre (R), Qucs and ngspice exist. </description>
