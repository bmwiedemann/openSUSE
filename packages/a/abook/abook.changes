- Update to version 0.6.1
  * support for mouse
  * scrolling now affects the viewport instead of the cursor
  * support for a colored UI
  * added "groups" as a default field
  * the UI now supports merging selected entries [key M]
    and removing duplicates [key U]
  * a "custom" output filter allows the specification of an output
    format using placeholders
  * search-next is now bound to "/" too
  * some output filters can now be used in the context
    of --mutt-query. This is the case of "vcard" and "custom"
    [ no --query option has been created and --mutt-query is fully
      backward compatible ]
  * ldif output filter has been fixed [output modified] in multiple
    ways, does not force output to latin1 anymore and supports input
    from stdin.
  * vcard input/output support:
    An original input filter implementation was provided soon
       after 0.6.0pre2.
    In 2012, an optional build-time option to link against libvformat
    was added for the very same task: parsing vcard.
    - It depends on the --enable-vformat ./configure switch
    - It's only used as an input filter, especially useful to
      deal with multi-valued fields and encoded characters.
  * when the UI requests a confirmation from the user before a
    destructive operation it does not treat unknown key as "yes" anymore.
  * allcsv output changes:
    - header line uses lowercase
    - "MOBILEPHONE" column name changed to "mobile" (consistent w.r.t.
      standard_fields)
    - defined custom fields as well are part of the output now
- Remove abook_vcard_import.patch; fixed on upstream release
- Split out language files into their own package
- Add autoconf and automake dependencies; automake is required by
  the configure script itself and autoconf is needed to run
  autoreconf
