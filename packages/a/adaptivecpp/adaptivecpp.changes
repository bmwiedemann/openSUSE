- Update to version 24.10.0~0:
  * AdaptiveCpp 24.10 introduces additional JIT-time optimizations,
    especially at the default ACPP_ADAPTIVITY_LEVEL=1 setting.
    Users may see substantial performance improvements for some
    kernels.
  * ACPP_ALLOCATION_TRACKING=1 was added which can enable the JIT
    compiler to include even more information about memory usage in
    code generation, further improving performance in some cases.
  * Added full support for the SYCL 2020 group algorithms library
    in the default generic JIT compiler on all backends.
  * Additional C++ parallel STL algorithms supported for offloading
  * Introducing the acpp::algorithms library: The algorithms
    underneath the C++ parallel STL offloading support are now also
    documented and exposed on the SYCL level for users who wish to
    invoke them from SYCL with a higher degree of control.
  * Added framework for JIT-time reflection to generic JIT
    compiler.
  * New extensions:
    ~ AdaptiveCpp_restrict_ptr
    ~ AdaptiveCpp_jit::compile_if
