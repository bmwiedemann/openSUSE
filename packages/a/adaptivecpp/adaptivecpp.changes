- Update to version 25.10.0:
  * AdaptiveCpp 25.10 introduces a deployment model for the
    distribution of AdaptiveCpp-compiled binaries. Users can now
    run acpp --acpp-deploy to let AdaptiveCpp collect all
    libraries that a binary will need at runtime. This can be
    conveniently used to create self-contained application
    packages -- together with AdaptiveCpp's generic JIT compiler,
    this makes it easy and convenient to distribute binaries that
    can offload kernels to NVIDIA, AMD, and Intel GPUs, as well as
    CPUs.

- Update to version 25.02.0:
  * Introducing AdaptiveCpp portable CUDA (PCUDA):
    AdaptiveCpp 25.02 introduces support for a new programming
    model in its generic JIT compiler: The portable CUDA (PCUDA)
    model. This programming model is a dialect of the CUDA and HIP
    programming model. AdaptiveCpp PCUDA allows taking CUDA or HIP
    source code, recompile with AdaptiveCpp, and obtain a single
    single binary that can dispatch kernels to CPUs, Intel GPUs,
    AMD GPUs, NVIDIA GPUs (or all at the same time).

- fix build with cmake4 boo#1239788 adaptivecpp-24.10.0-cmake4.patch
- version is 24.10.0 because the package packs tags without offset
- pin to llvm19

- Update to version 24.10.0~0:
  * AdaptiveCpp 24.10 introduces additional JIT-time optimizations,
    especially at the default ACPP_ADAPTIVITY_LEVEL=1 setting.
    Users may see substantial performance improvements for some
    kernels.
  * ACPP_ALLOCATION_TRACKING=1 was added which can enable the JIT
    compiler to include even more information about memory usage in
    code generation, further improving performance in some cases.
  * Added full support for the SYCL 2020 group algorithms library
    in the default generic JIT compiler on all backends.
  * Additional C++ parallel STL algorithms supported for offloading
  * Introducing the acpp::algorithms library: The algorithms
    underneath the C++ parallel STL offloading support are now also
    documented and exposed on the SYCL level for users who wish to
    invoke them from SYCL with a higher degree of control.
  * Added framework for JIT-time reflection to generic JIT
    compiler.
  * New extensions:
    ~ AdaptiveCpp_restrict_ptr
    ~ AdaptiveCpp_jit::compile_if
