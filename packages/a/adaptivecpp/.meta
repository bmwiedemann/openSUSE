  <description>AdaptiveCpp is the independent, community-driven modern platform for C++-based heterogeneous programming models targeting CPUs and GPUs from all major vendors. AdaptiveCpp lets applications adapt themselves to all the hardware found in the system. This includes use cases where a single binary needs to be able to target all supported hardware, or utilize hardware from different vendors simultaneously.</description>
