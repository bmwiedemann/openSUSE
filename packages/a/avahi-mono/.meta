  <title>Mono Bindings for avahi, the D-BUS Service for Zeroconf and Bonjour</title>
  <description>This package provides Mono bindings for avahi. Avahi is an
implementation of the DNS Service Discovery and MulticastDNS
specifications for Zeroconf Computing. It uses D-BUS for communication
between user applications and a system daemon. The daemon is used to
coordinate application efforts in caching replies, necessary to
minimize the traffic imposed on networks. The Avahi mDNS responder is
now feature complete, implementing all MUSTs and the majority of the
SHOULDs of the mDNS and DNS-SD RFCs. It passes all tests in the Apple
Bonjour conformance test suite. In addition, it supports some nifty
things, like correct mDNS reflection across LAN segments.</description>
