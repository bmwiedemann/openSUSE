  API changes
    libfa has now a function fa_json to export an FA as a JSON file, and
    fa_state_* functions that make it possible to iterate over the FA's
    states and transitions. (Pedro Valero Mejia)

      in the lens language. We used to handle constructs like "\\" and

      performance gains.

* 0.7.0 - 2010-01-14
* Support for context-free lenses via the 'let rec' keyword. The syntax
  is experimental, though the feature is here to stay. See
  lenses/json.aug for an example of what's possible with that.

  be quoted anymore. The online help has been greatly improved.

  file is skipped.

* Do not choke on non-existing lens during save
* Change the metadata for files under /augeas/files slightly: the node
  /augeas/files/$PATH/lens now has the name of the lens used to load the

  of nodesets (ticket #89)
