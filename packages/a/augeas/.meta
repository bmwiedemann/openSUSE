  <title>A library for changing configuration files</title>
  <description>A library for programmatically editing configuration files. Augeas
parses configuration files into a tree structure, which it exposes
through its public API. Changes made through the API are written back
to the initially read files.

The transformation works very hard to preserve comments and formatting
details. It is controlled by ``lens'' definitions that describe the
file format and the transformation into a tree.</description>
