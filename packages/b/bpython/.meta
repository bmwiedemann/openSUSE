  <title>Fancy Curses Interface to the Python Interactive Interpreter</title>
  <description>Bpython is an enhanced Python interactive interpreter that uses curses
and provides the following main features: in-line syntax highlighting;
readline-like autocompletion with suggestions displayed as you type; expected
argument specification for functions; a handy pastebin function to quickly
submit your code and return a URL. Its goal is to bring together a few handy
ideas to enhance the standard interpreter without getting carried away.</description>
