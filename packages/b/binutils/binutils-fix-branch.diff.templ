This is used to manually patch the bison generated files when
the binutils-X.YZ-branch.diff touches them.  That diff is generated
directly from git and doesn't contain the generated .c/h files.
The base tarball does contain them, but generated from the unpatched state.
In SLE12 and older we can't regenerate them due to too old versions
of flex and bison.
So, when the branch diff _does_ touch them we need to do the regeneration
via such a manual patch.
For now this is intentionally empty.
