Fix for bsc#1179341

the movload->movconst relaxation can be done only with REX
rewriting, and hence needs a GOTPCRELX relocation.  With old object
files we might still see GOTPCREL relocs, even with REX bytes available.
We still can't do such rewriting and hence need to stay with the old
rewriting into a lea.
