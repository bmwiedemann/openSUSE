  <title>LALR(1) parser generator</title>
  <description>Berkeley Yacc is a LALR(1) parser generator. It has been made as compatible as
possible with AT&amp;T Yacc and it accepts any input specification that conforms to
the AT&amp;T Yacc documentation. In contrast to bison, it is written to avoid
dependencies upon a particular compiler.</description>
