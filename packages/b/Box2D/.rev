    <comment>Box2D is an open source C++ engine for simulating rigid bodies in 2D. Box2D is developed by Erin Catto and has the zlib license.
It's a necessary dependency for qml-box2d and thus newer gcompris-qt</comment>

    <comment>- Fix the source URL
- Update to version 2.4.1.
  * API Changes
    * Extended distance joint to have a minimum and maximum limit.
    * Removed rope joint. Use the distance joint instead.
    * B2_USER_SETTINGS and b2_user_settings.h can control user 
      data, length units, and maximum polygon vertices.
    * Default user data is now uintptr_t instead of void*
    * b2FixtureDef::restitutionThreshold lets you set the 
      restitution velocity threshold per fixture.
  * BREAKING Changes
    * BREAKING: distance joint 0 stiffness now means the spring is 
     turned off rather than making the joint rigid.
    * BREAKING: distance joint minimum and maximum must be set 
      correctly to get old behavior.
  * Infrastructure
    * Library installation function available in CMake.
    * Shared library (DLL) option available.
    * Bug fixes
- Updates since 2.3.1
  * Infrastructure
    * Documentation in Doxygen format
    * Unit test support
    * Continuous integration testing using Travis CI
    * Limited use of C++11 (nullptr and override)
  * Collision
    * Chain and edge shape must now be one-sided to eliminate ghost 
      collisions
    * Broad-phase optimizations
    * Added b2ShapeCast for linear shape casting
  * Dynamics
    * Joint limits are now predictive and not stateful
    * Experimental 2D cloth (rope)
    * b2Body::SetActive -&gt; b2Body::SetEnabled
    * Better support for running multiple worlds
    * Handle zero density better
      * The body behaves like a static body
      * The body is drawn with a red color
    * Added translation limit to wheel joint
    * World dump now writes to box2d_dump.inl
    * Static bodies are never awake
    * All joints with spring-dampers now use stiffness and damping
    * Added utility functions to convert frequency and damping 
      ratio to stiffness and damping
- Remove Box2D-fix-version-2.3.1.patch, fixed.
- Change package name from Box2D to box2d.
