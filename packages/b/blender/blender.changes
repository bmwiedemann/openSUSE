  linking, and disabling LTO altogether dependent on available
  memory makes the build unreproducible.

     Due to various issues with drivers for AMD GCN 1.0 architecture
     , those cards are no longer supported for Cycles rendering
     When using add-ons in Blender 2.79 that take advantage of the
     new data-block pointer properties, the resulting .blend files
     can't be opened in earlier versions of Blender. Attempting to
     open such .blend files in Blender 2.78c and earlier may crash.
     Some Interface Themes may need to be reloaded to work properly.
     The text color contained in a layout.box() is now defined in
     User Preferences » Themes » User Interface » Box section
     Rig compatibility:
        Changes to IK snapping may affect rigs that use non-uniform
        IK scaling. (rigs created in the 2.78 builds.)
     During the 2.78 series: IK snapping was partly broken.
        This has been fixed for Blender 2.79
        Rigs created in Blender 2.78 may not be compatible with
        2.79.
        Rigs created in Blender 2.77 may still work.
     When using the add-on Rigify, please note:
        Compatibility is broken for this release. There's no
        guarantee rigs created in previous Blender versions will
        work correctly.
        Rigs created in Blender 2.78 may not be compatible with 2.79.
        Rigs created in Blender 2.77 may still work.
        Save your work before attempting upgrading your rigs.

  - Cycles Rendering
    Volume rendering and Subsurface Scattering can be rendered with GPUs.
    Volume and Glossy sampling is improved.
    New Ashikhmin-Shirley distribution enhances Glossy and Anisotropic BSDFs.
    Memory usage during rendering is improved.
    OSL rendering is faster.

    More blend modes are available and new tools to fill and mask have been
    added.
  - Compositing
    A new Sun Beams node has been added to the compositor.
  - Game Development
    A new Mouse Actuator that can achieve a mouse look effect (among other
    things), has been added.
    The Property Sensor has new evaluation types.
    The TrackTo Actuator has new menus to select up/track axis.
    The Property Actuator has a new level mode.
    The Mouse-Over-Any Sensor has new X-Ray and Property/Material detection
    options.
    A new BGE Debug and Contraints Wrapper API have been added.
  - Freestyle NPR Rendering
    The Freestyle line rendering engine has been integrated into Cycles in
    addition to the Blender Internal (BI). Freestyle provides Cycles users
    with a versatile non-photorealistic (NPR) line rendering solution. Most
    Freestyle options work in the same way for both Cycles and BI. Line
    textures in Freestyle for Cycles are defined by means of shader nodes
    (unlike Freestyle for BI, which relies on the conventional texture mapping
    and influence panels). New per-material Freestyle line settings provide a
    reliable mean to specify line colors applicable to both Cycles and the
    BI. The Freestyle Python API also has user-visible updates for better code
    readability and run-time performance.
  - Animation
    More Features
    Color ramps now support color interpolation in hue mode both clock-wise
    and counter-clock-wise.
    CtrlF in Animation Editors, is a convenience shortcut to activate Filter
    by Name functionality.
    Weights now draw in wireframe mode in the 3D view.
    Temporary data gets deleted when closing Blender.
    The Video Editor has a new Gaussian blur filter.
    New camera presets: Blackmagic Pocket Cinema and Blackmagic Production
    4K.
  - Addons
    FBX improvements: Import now supports armatures, shapekeys, animations,
    with shapekeys also being supported for export.
    New DXF importer supports 3D(SubD) geometry, and geo-referencing. It
    imports curves as curve obkects and adds control over various geometry merge
    options.
    New UV addon for align distribution and copy/paste (!!) of UVs.
    New Game Publishing Addon is available for game developers!
    New addon for named layers & grouped layer management.

Wed Jul  2 12:54:03 UTC 2014 - stephan.barth@suse.com

- Introduced hard build requirement for Python3 >= 3.4, because otherwise it
  won't build anymore.
- Adjusted Python 3 path for building 13.1, which doesn't build anymore anyway
- Fixed some minor spec file entries, because version string in the tarball
  changed again
- update to version 2.71 from 2.70a
  Most important changes from upstream (see full list under
  http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Dev:Ref/Release_Notes/2.71)
  - Animation
    More easing equations added to the IPO editor for better animation
    control, locking time to other windows is again possible, auto snapping is
    now independent from display type.

    The user interface now offers more feedback, especially on errors, updates
    driver expressions automatically on editing, includes more icons and
    offers more editing tools.

    New tools also include lasso selection support, non-linked duplication for
    strips, and setting preview range based on selected strips.
  - Modelling
    The new per-face normals feature allows blender to display and export
    sharp edges correctly without geometry duplication.

    In addition, selection tools offer more options.
  - Sculpting/Painting
    New features include a HSL color wheel for color selection and tools to
    handle homogenous density in dynamic topology sculpting.

    Dyntopo and matcap display for sculpt mode have also had performance
    optimizations.

  - Game Engine
    UI to deactivate logic bricks, multi-threaded animations, shadows-only
    materials and more action layers are among the new features for the game
    engine
  - Freestyle NPR Rendering

    Freestyle has been upgraded with textured stroke support. Textured stroke
    support makes it possible to apply patterns to the lines and simulate
    rough surfaces or different kinds of brush tips for the strokes
    themselves.

    Line sorting also gives artists more control over the order of line
    drawing
  - User Interface

    Interface features include new icons for texture painting, resizeable
    preview widgets and draggable popups.
  - More Features
    More control for curve bevelling, explicit shadow cast control for blender
    internal materials, new distortion model for motion tracking and better
    handles for mask editors.

 *The Blender Foundation and online developer community is proud to
  present Blender 2.57a. This is the first stable release of the
  Blender 2.5 series, representing the culmination of many years of
  redesign and development work.
 *We name this version "Stable" not only because it's mostly feature
  complete, but especially thanks to the 1000s of fixes and feature
  updates we did since the 2.5 beta versions were published.
 *The next 2 months we will keep working on finishing a couple of
  left-over 2.5 targets and we expect to get feedback and bug reports
  from users to handle as well. If all goes well, the 2.58 version
  then can be the final release of the 2.5 series, with a massive
  amount of new projects to be added for an exciting cycle of 2.6x
  versions. Target is to release updates every 2 months this year.

  part feature complete. The Python API has had some extensive
  changes, most notably in naming conventions and in creation and
  access of properties.
  Since Blender 2.55 beta over 440 bugs were fixed!

   are making angle.
  *2.4 feature back:
   For constraints that have 'disabled' flag (because it has
   invalid input) the name was drawn in red. Easy to recognize
   constraints that stopped working.

Wed Dec  1 10:06:26 UTC 2010 - davejplater@gmail.com

- Update to svn snapshot blender-2.55.33410
- Upstream changes :
  *fix for crashes trying to resolve paths "location[]" or "location.."
  *increase the reference counts when setting default scene compo nodes
 else removing them can set the user count < 0.
  *quit blender if the first X11 window fails to open.
 mainly just to avoid a segfault so the user knows its not a bug.
  *workaround [#24958] Cloth pinning not working
  *bugfix [#23406] DPX Images load darker then saved, UI broken.
  *patch from JacobF on IRC, copy smoke settings. double checked none
 of these are used for runtime.
  *bugfix [#22638] Alpha channel not saved when using texture paint
  *minor console changes.
   remove report argument from console functions.
   don't update the scroll area while drawing, do this within operators instead.
   dont redraw while selecting text unless selection changes.
  *bugfix [#23423] Multi-window : closing game windows cause blender crash
  *Smoke now uses only one point cache where both normal and high resolution smoke are stored together:
    Separate caches were causing quite a lot of problems both in principle and practice.
    For example it doesn't really make sense to have different frame ranges for normal and high resolution smoke, but this was fully possible before.
    Also to fully bake the smoke you had to do a "Bake All Dynamics", which completely defeats the whole point of the feature!
    As a result of this change the smoke cache usage is much much simpler and less error prone.
    This is quite a big change, but hopefully there should be less rather than more problems as a result :)
   Some other related changes:
    Changing the cache name now works for disk caches properly too, it
     now just renames the cache files so should be faster too!
    Smoke is now always forced to disk cache with step 1 on file load
     as there were some strange cases where smoke was trying to use memory cache.
    Disabled smoke debug prints from console.
    Disabled changing smoke parameters when smoke is baked.
  *misc small changes.
    commented unused View3D->flag's
    popup dialog now centers over the mouse
    only overwrite image alpha with render settings on save if saving the render result.
  *Bugfix #24986 bugfix [#24974] bugfix [#24798] Bugfix #24976 fix [#24990]

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov 16 08:10:07 UTC 2010 - davejplater@gmail.com

- Update to 2.55.33093
  *Fix [#24310] With high poly numbers when sculpting, modifier keys hang
   reported by Eclectiel L
   When working with very heavy scenes Blender can seem to 'hang' (not responding). Key events that happen
   during this period may get lost, especially for modifier keys.
   Adding extra handling to account for these situations.
  *bugfix [#24696] Export OBJ - Selection Only toggle button has the wrong default state.
   Added convenience function to operators, 'as_keywords()', so operator settings can be passed directly to a function as keyword arguments.
   The problem in this case was that dictionary access to operator properties was not returning rna-property defaults, so as_keywords() ensures all defaults are set.
  *Bugfix, reported in IRC
   The enum "rotmode" was read using an array, without checking for boundary
   cases, causing crashes on bad input. (Wahooney report 2, thanks!)
  *Bugfix #24726
   Doing F1-load a lot of times on same .blend could crash.
   Janne karhu provided a potential fix, which is good to add
   anyway. Will ask him to verify too.
   Added XXX warning for these lines, after filesel exec no
   context variables should be re-used. Is for later investigation.
  *fix for fix, r33086.
   - incorrect range check broke ZYX euler rotations, use MIN/MAX constants so this doesn't happen again.
   - BGE Armature PyAPI also wasn't using correct min/max with rotation modes.
   - clamp on file read rather then when calling the rotation functions, so developers don't use invalid args without realizing it.
   - added assert() checks for debug builds so invalid axis constants don't slip through.
  *patch #24737] PyCObject depreciated in py3k [patch]
   from Dan Eicher (dna), use PyCapsule rather then PyCObject
  *patch [#24742] materials.pop() doesn't decrement user count
  *from Dan Eicher (dna)
  *fix for matrix * vector rotation order.
  *FBX Export, small changes made while looking into reported bug. (no functional changes)
   - Warn for armature deformed meshes which are scaled, these don't work quite the same as in blender, reported as [#24663].
   - Use matrix.decompose() to convert a matrix to loc/rot/scale.
   - get vert/edge/face lists for each mesh only once.
   - faster euler rad -> deg conversion function.

  *add back red tint for zero user datablocks.
  *bugfix [#24682] Render artifacts with mat node
  *Related to #24653: added scene.collada_export() function, to use instead of an
  *operator for external render engines, since operators should not be called in
  *the render() callback.
  *Hide "active" checkbox in ui for "fluid" type fluid objects as it's not used by fluidsim.

  *Seamless texture used for beveled curve is now really seamless (thanks to Mario G. Kishalmi aka lmg)
  *r33039 added dependency to COLLADA for blenderplayer, but it's really not needed there.
  *Stubbing for now.
  *netrender
  *unreported fixes for 3ds import
  *- non ASCII names would break loading.
  *- meshes with no faces would break loading too.

  *bugfix [#22794] Inconsistent behaviour with Panorama, border rendering
  *fix for last commit with collada
  *bugfix [#24616] Apply Visual Transform doesn't always apply location
  *- object updates were not being flushed, so children weren't updating.
  *- apply the matrix relative to the parent, added this as an option to
     object_apply_mat4() which allows assigning the worldspace matrix in
     python without worrying about the parent.
  *Image editor & texture properties, add new Image, inits 'start' now
   to frame 1 for sequences.
  *Patch [#24608] Fix for typo and better indentation in command line help by Susanne H. (sanne). Thanks!
  *Fix for [#24597] Option External in Smoke cache affects settings of start and end frame of simulation
  * Don't change anything in the pointcache unless a valid external cache is found.

Thu Nov  4 12:56:15 UTC 2010 - davejplater@gmail.com

- Update to 3rd beta version 2.55.
- Removed blender wrapper as it's no longer necessary.
- Removed pre_checkin.sh - 3rd party blacklisted sources removed.
- Upstream changes:
  *Big improvements - This software has been used extensively in
   production of the Durian open movie project "Sintel".
  *Feature complete - Although some of the 2.5 targets have been
   postponed, such as multi-window support showing multiple scenes
   , a full RNA data level dependency graph, or radial menus.
  *Exciting improvements in Sculpting - Faster, much more stable
   and better brushes.
  *Missing/Incomplete Features - Although really most of it is
   there, not all functionality from 2.4x has been restored yet.
   Some functionality may work in a different way. Some features
   are still slower to use than before.
  *Bugs - We've fixed a lot lately, but there are still quite a
   few bugs. For this second beta around 200 bugs were fixed.
  *Changes - If you're used to the old Blenders, Blender 2.5 may
   seem quite different at first. Be prepared to read a bit about
   this, how to reconfigure things, and learn to use the new
   built-in 2.5 search functionality!
