    <comment>This is the attempt to make Bazel package a multiversion package.

Bazel releases new versions with backwards incompatible changes quite fast. That's really painful for Envoy and Tensorflow - main projects which are built by Bazel and we package in openSUSE. Some updates of Bazel break lots of packages.

In order to prevent that, I would like to provide multiple versions of Bazel in openSUSE. I'm going to submit few more Bazel versions (0.26.x, 0.24.x, 0.23.x etc.) and then make a request to the main Bazel package.

If this SR looks good to you, please accept it together with:
- bazel
- bazel0.24
- bazel0.25
- bazel0.26</comment>
