%description
Buildah provides a command line tool which can be used to:
- Create a working container, either from scratch or using an image as a
  starting point
- Create an image, either from a working container or via the instructions in a
  Dockerfile
- Build images in either the OCI image format or the traditional
  upstream docker image format
- Mount a working container's root filesystem for manipulation
- Unmount a working container's root filesystem
- Update the contents of a container's root filesystem
- Delete a working container or an image
