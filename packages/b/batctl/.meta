  <title>B.A.T.M.A.N. advanced control and management tool</title>
  <description>Why do I need batctl?  B.A.T.M.A.N. advanced operates on layer 2 and
thus all hosts participating in the virtual switch are completely
transparent for all protocols above layer 2.  Therefore the common
diagnosis tools do not work as expected.  To overcome these problems
batctl was created.  At the moment batctl contains ping, traceroute,
tcpdump and interfaces to the kernel module settings.
