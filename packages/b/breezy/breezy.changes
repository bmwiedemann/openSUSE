- version update to 3.1.0
  3.0.3
  Bug Fixes
  *********
   * Don't throw an error attempting to read the parent of a ref.
     (Jelmer Vernooĳ)
   * Fix fast-exporting of symlinks on Python 3. (Jelmer Vernooĳ, #1851478)
   * Don't rely on private transport attribute in fast-import.
     (Jelmer Vernooĳ, #1854607)
   * Fix conversion of time_t to int on certain platforms (arm64, armhf,
     ppc64el). (Jelmer Vernooĳ)
  External Compatibility Breaks
  *****************************
  * The ``brz init-repo`` command has been renamed to
    ``brz init-shared-repo`` to emphasize that it creates
    shared repositories rather than just any kind of repository.
    (Jelmer Vernooĳ)
  New Features
  ************
  * A new ``brz land`` command can merge merge proposals on Launchpad,
    GitHub and GitLab sites. (Jelmer Vernooĳ, #1816213)
  * The 'patch' command is now bundled with brz.
    Imported from bzrtools by Aaron Bentley. (Jelmer Vernooĳ)
  * The 'quilt' plugin, extracted from brz-debian, is now
    bundled. (Jelmer Vernooĳ)
  * A new ``calculate_revnos`` configuration option (defaults to enabled)
    can be used to disable revno display for branch formats that
    do not natively store revnos. This speeds up ``brz log`` on
    the Samba git branch by 33%.
    (Jelmer Vernooĳ)
  * Directly read mtab rather than using psutil when trying to figure out
    filesystem types. This removes a dependency that not all users may
    have installed and speeds up import time since psutil brings in
    various other modules. (Jelmer Vernooĳ)
  * ``brz diff`` now has a --color argument that can write
    color diff output. This is based on the cdiff code in
    bzrtools by Aaron Bentley.
    (Jelmer Vernooĳ, #376594)
  * Information about tree references can now be updated on remote
    branches. (Jelmer Vernooĳ)
  * Warn the user when they attempt to use Breezy in a Subversion
    working copy. (Jelmer Vernooĳ)
  * Add a basic Mercurial plugin that mentions that .hg repositories
    are unsupported when the user attempts to access one.
    (Jelmer Vernooĳ)
  * The ``2a`` format now officially supports storing tree references.
    It always partially supported storing tree reference data,
    and would happily pull in tree reference data from other repository
    formats. (Jelmer Vernooĳ)
  * A new ``fossil`` plugin has been added that warns users when they
    attempt to access Fossil repositories.
    (Jelmer Vernooĳ, #1848821)
  * When pushing to Git repositories, symrefs are now followed.
    (Jelmer Vernooĳ, #1800393)
  * New ``brz clone`` command, which clones everything under
    a control directory. I.e. all colocated branches, like
    ``git clone``. (Jelmer Vernooĳ, #831939)
  * ``brz sprout`` is now an alias for ``brz branch``.
    (Jelmer Vernooĳ)
  * ``brz branch`` now accepts a ``-b`` flag with the
    name of the colocated branch to sprout.
    (Jelmer Vernooĳ, #1869977)
  * Add a ``breezy.__main__`` module so that
    ``python3 -m breezy`` works. (Jelmer Vernooĳ)
  Improvements
  ************
  .. Improvements to existing commands, especially improved performance
     or memory usage, or better results.
  * A new ``--commit-message`` option has been added to
    ``brz propose``, for hosting sites that support it.
    (Jelmer Vernooĳ)
  * Automatically upgrade to branch format 8 when setting branch references.
    (Jelmer Vernooĳ)
  * The ``ssh`` configuration variable can be used to set the default
    SSH implementation. (Jelmer Vernooĳ, #650757)
  * ``locks.steal_dead`` is now enabled by default.
    (Jelmer Vernooĳ, #220464)
  * The substitution variables for the ``change_editor`` configuration
    option are now "{old_path}" and "{new_path}" rather than "@old_path" and
    "@new_path". The former is more consistent with the way substitutions
    work in other configuration options. The old syntax is still supported.
    (Jelmer Vernooĳ, #708718)
  * The ``brz inventory`` command now accepts a ``--include-root``
    argument to show the tree root. (Jelmer Vernooĳ)
  * Fix support for reading Git repositories over HTTP without
    a smart server. (Jelmer Vernooĳ)
  * CVS pserver URLs now indicate that the pserver protocol is not
    supported. (Jelmer Vernooĳ)
  * Git repositories with submodules can now be imported into 2a
    branches; submodules are converted to nested trees.
    (Jelmer Vernooĳ, #402814)
  * Python 3 is now used by default to run scripts, etc. from the makefile.
    (Jelmer Vernooĳ)
  * ``.git/config`` is now consulted to determine the users' identity
    for commits, and the gpg_signing_key. (Jelmer Vernooĳ)
  * Ignore special files (fifos, block/character devices, sockets)
    when finding changes in Git working trees. (Jelmer Vernooĳ, #1857244)
  * Parse error messages from stderr when a remote Git server
    hangs up. (Jelmer Vernooĳ)
  Bug Fixes
  *********
  * Print a sensible error message when conversion for an option fails
    (i.e. when a non-int is specified as the value for an integer
    parameter) (#237844, Jelmer Vernooĳ)
  * Don't include timestamps in filenames when reporting on binary
    files in diff. (Jelmer Vernooĳ, #71307)
  * Ignore UnknownFormatErrors when scanning for control directories.
    (Jelmer Vernooĳ, #468332)
  * Fix fetching from remote git repositories in ``brz git-import``.
    (Jelmer Vernooĳ, #1836238)
  * A new ``TreeEntry.is_unmodified`` method has added, which allows
    merge to check for unmodified files without relying
    on the .revision attribute that is not available for Git trees.
    This fixes LCA merges for Git repositories.
    (Jelmer Vernooĳ, #1826663)
  * Fix passing of directories in specific_files to
    GitWorkingTree.iter_entries_by_dir(). (Jelmer Vernooĳ, #1844054)
  * Fix ``brz diff --using`` when {old_path} and {new_path} are not
    specified in the template. (#1847915, Jelmer Vernooĳ)
  * Ignore ghost tags when interacting with remote Git repositories.
    (Jelmer Vernooĳ)
  * Fix ``setup_ui=False`` when initializing Breezy.
    (Jelmer Vernooĳ, #1852647)
  * Fix backwards compatibility with Bazaar by supporting the
    $BZR_EMAIL variable. (Jelmer Vernooĳ, #1869178)
  * Cope with non-ascii characters in Git signatures.
    (Jelmer Vernooĳ, #1869533)
  * Fix use of ``proxy_bypass`` on Python 3.
    (Jelmer Vernooĳ, #1878698)
  * Create $XDG_HOME_DIR if it does not exist.
    (Jelmer Vernooĳ)
  API Changes
  ***********
  * New ``Tree.get_transform`` method for getting a ``TreeTransform``
    object. (Jelmer Vernooij)
  * The ``Tree.get_root_id`` method has been removed. Use
    ``Tree.path2id('')`` instead. (Jelmer Vernooĳ)
  * ``Repository.find_branches`` now returns an iterator rather than a
    list. (Jelmer Vernooĳ, #413970)
  * New ``Tree.get_nested_tree`` method for retrieving a nested tree.
    (Jelmer Vernooĳ)
  * The ``ControlDirFormat.register_server_prober`` method has been removed.
    Instead, probers can now have a ``priority`` method to influence
    when they are run. (Jelmer Vernooĳ)
  * New ``urlutils.strip_segment_parameters`` function for
    stripping segment parameters from a URL.
    (Jelmer Vernooĳ)
  * ``Tree.id2path`` has a new optional argument ``recurse``,
    that determines whether it scans through nested trees.
    (Jelmer Vernooĳ)
  * ``VersionedFiles.add_content`` can now be used to add
    content from ``ContentFactory`` objects.
    (Jelmer Vernooĳ)
