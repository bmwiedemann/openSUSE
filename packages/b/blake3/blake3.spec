%description
BLAKE3 is a modern cryptographic hash function designed for
high performance, strong security, and parallelism. It builds
upon earlier BLAKE and BLAKE2 designs but introduces a Merkle
tree structure that enables efficient parallel computation
across multiple cores, making it significantly faster than many
traditional hash functions like SHA-2 or SHA-3. BLAKE3 offers
a fixed 256-bit output and is designed to be simple, compact,
and memory-efficient, making it suitable for a wide range of
platformsâ€”from embedded devices to high-performance servers. In
addition to being a cr yptographic hash, BLAKE3 can also serve as
a keyed hash (MAC) or extendable output function (XOF), making it
versatile for various cryptographic applications.
