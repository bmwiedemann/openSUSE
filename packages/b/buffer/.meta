  <title>Buffering stdin and stdout</title>
  <description>This is a program designed to speed up writing tapes on remote tape
drives.  When this program is put &quot;in the pipe,&quot; two processes are
started.  One process reads from standard-in and the other writes to
standard-out.  Both processes communicate via shared memory.</description>
