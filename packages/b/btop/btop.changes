    dGPU as well as AMD 680M aGPU. NVIDIA required proper drivers as well
    as having nvtop and nvidia-smi working properly (if related, maybe not
    strictly required)

    Building ROCm SMI static library...
    Running CMake...
    
    Building and linking...
    100%-> lib/rocm_smi_lib/build/rocm_smi/librocm_smi64.a (6.2MiB)
    ROCm SMI build complete in (03s)
  and proper linking occurs

  * Maybe
  * updated color change
  * Added: Option to hide the small cpu graphs for processes
  * Add Fedora/RHEL install docs
  * [fix] Color correction
  * Changed: Small graphs now show colors for each character
  * [feature] Created 'Elementarish' theme
  * Fixed: Getting selfpath on macos (fix for finding theme folder)
  * switch Logger calls to debug() to avoid filling up the logfile
  * rename zfs_pools_only option to zfs_hide_datasets, make its description clearer
  * check if at least one object was read before updating ZFS pool io in zfs_collect_pool_total_stats(), use try-catch to prevent possible crashes from int_64t conversions
  * add "?" to see help
  * Fixed: Logo transparency
  * Use fs::directory_iterator() instead of readdir() in ZFS functions, use fs::path instead of strings.
  * Move get_zfs_stat_file() and zfs_collect_pool_total_stats() functions declarations to btop_collect.cpp so they aren't included when compiling for macos and freebsd
  * Made ZFS stats collection compatible with zfs_pools_only option. ZFS pool's stat filepath points to the objset-* file when the option is disabled, otherwise it points to the pool's stats directory. Made ZFS total pool stat collection into a separate function for clean code. Also removed an unnecessary variable in the default ZFS stat collection, and changed io_ticks to track the number of reads/writes, reducing unnecessary calculations.
  * Re-implemented ZFS stat collection to be compatible with new ZFS versions, now it uses files "/proc/spl/kstat/zfs/*pool_name*/objset*". Needs additional work to be compatible with the option "zfs_pools_only".
  * Pass const string ref
  * Changed: Rewrite of process sorting and tree generation including fixes for tree sorting and mouse support
  * Add solarized_light theme
  * Add zfs_pools_only option
