Mon Dec 21 10:54:33 UTC 2020 - Pedro Monreal <pmonreal@suse.com>

- Version update to 1.67 [bsc#1180215, CVE-2020-28052]
  * CVE-2020-28052: OpenBSDBCrypt.checkPassword utility method
    compared incorrect data when checking the password
  * Defects Fixed:
    - BCJSSE: SunJSSE compatibility fix - override of getChannel()
      removed and 'urgent data' behaviour should now conform to
      what the SunJSSE expects
    - Nested BER data could sometimes cause issues in octet strings
    - Certificates/CRLs with short signatures could cause an exception
      in toString() in the BC X509 Certificate implmentation
    - In line with latest changes in the JVM, SignatureSpis which
      don't require parameters now return null on engineGetParameters()
    - The RSA KeyFactory now always preferentially produces RSAPrivateCrtKey
      where it can on requests for a KeySpec based on an RSAPrivateKey
    - CMSTypedStream$FullReaderStream now handles zero length reads correctly
    - Unecessary padding was added on KMAC when the key string was block aligned
    - Zero length data would cause an unexpected exception from RFC5649WrapEngine
    - OpenBSDBcrypt was failing to handle some valid prefixes
  * Additional Features and Functionality
    - Performance improvement of Argon2 and Noekeon
    - A setSessionKeyObfuscation() method has been added to
      PublicKeyKeyEncryptionMethodGenerator to allow turning off of session key
      obfuscation (default is on, method primarily to get around early version
      GPG issues with AES-128 keys)
    - Implemented 'safegcd' constant-time modular inversion (as well as a
      variable-time variant). It has replaced Fermat inversion in all our EC
      code, and BigInteger.modInverse in several other places, particularly
      signers. This improves side-channel protection, and also gives a
      significant performance boost
    - Performance of custom binary ECC curves and Edwards Curves has been improved
    - BCJSSE: New boolean system property 'org.bouncycastle.jsse.keyManager.checkEKU'
      allows to disable ExtendedKeyUsage restrictions when selecting credentials
      (although the peer may still complain)
    - Initial support has been added for "Composite Keys and Signatures For Use
      In Internet PKI" using the test OID. Please note there will be further
      refinements to this as the draft is standardised
    - The BC EdDSA signature API now supports keys implementing all methods on
      the EdECKey and XECKey interfaces directly
    - Work has begun on classes to support the ETSI TS 103 097, Intelligent
      Transport Systems (ITS) in the bcpkix package
    - Further optimization work has been done on GCM
    - A NewHope based processor, similar to the one for Key Agreement has been
      added for trying to "quantum hard" KEM algorithms
    - PGP clear signed signatures now support SHA-224
    - Treating absent vs NULL as equivalent can now be configured by a system
      property. By default this is not enabled
    - Mode name checks in Cipher strings should now make sure an improper mode
      name always results in a NoSuchAlgorithmException
    - In line with changes in OpenSSL, the OpenSSLPBKDF now uses UTF8 encoding

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul 28 18:50:39 UTC 2020 - Pedro Monreal <pmonreal@suse.com>

- Version update to 1.66
  * Defects Fixed:
    - EdDSA verifiers now reset correctly after rejecting overly long signatures.
    - BCJSSE: SSLSession.getPeerCertificateChain could throw NullPointerException.
    - qTESLA-I verifier would reject some valid signatures.
    - qTESLA verifiers now reject overly long signatures.
    - PGP regression caused failure to preserve existing version header when
      headers were reset.
    - PKIXNameConstraintValidator had a bad cast preventing use of multiple
      OtherName constraints.
    - Serialisation of the non-CRT RSA Private Key could cause a NullPointerException.
    - An extra 4 bytes was included in the start of HSS public key encodings.
    - CMS with Ed448 using a direct signature was using id-shake256-len
      rather than id-shake256.
    - Use of GCMParameterSpec could cause an AccessControlException under
      some circumstances.
    - DTLS: Fixed high-latency HelloVerifyRequest handshakes.
    - An encoding bug for rightEncoded() in KMAC has been fixed.
    - For a few values the cSHAKE implementation would add unnecessary pad bytes
      where the N and S strings produced encoded data that was block aligned.
    - There were a few circumstances where Argon2BytesGenerator might hit an
      unexpected null. These have been removed.
  * Additional Features and Functionality
    - The qTESLA signature algorithm has been updated to v2.8 (20191108).
    - BCJSSE: Client-side OCSP stapling now supports status_request_v2 extension.
    - Support has been added for "ocsp.enable", "ocsp.responderURL" and

      make the provider only produce version 1 PKCS8 PrivateKeyInfo structures.
    - The PKIX CertPathBuilder will now take the target certificate from the target
      constraints if a specific certificate is given to the selector.
    - BCJSSE: A range of ARIA and CAMELLIA cipher suites added to supported list.
    - BCJSSE: Now supports the PSS signature schemes from RFC 8446 (TLS 1.2 onwards).
    - Performance of the Base64 encoder has been improved.
    - The PGPPublicKey class will now include direct key signatures when checking
      for key expiry times.
  * NOTES:
    - The qTESLA update breaks compatibility with previous versions.
      Private keys now include a hash of the public key at the end,
      and signatures are no longer interoperable with previous versions. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------

       implementation of PSS.

    - BCJSSE: KeyManager selection of server credentials now prefers matching
       SNI hostname (if any).
    - BCJSSE: KeyManager may now fallback to imperfect credentials (expired,
       SNI mismatch).
    - BCJSSE: Client-side OCSP stapling support (beta version: via status_request
       extension only, provides jdk.tls.client.enableStatusRequestExtension, and
       requires CertPathBuilder support).
    - TLS: DSA in JcaTlsCrypto now falls back to stream signing to work around
       NoneWithDSA limitations in default provider.
