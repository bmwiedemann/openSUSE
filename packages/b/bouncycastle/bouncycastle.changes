  * Security Advisory:
    - CVE-2019-17359: A change to the ASN.1 parser in 1.63 introduced
      a regression that can cause an OutOfMemoryError to occur on
      parsing ASN.1 data.
  * Defects Fixed:
    - OpenSSH: Fixed padding in generated Ed25519 private keys.

    - Validation of headers in PemReader now looks for tailing dashes in header.
    - Some compatibility issues around the signature encryption algorithm
      field in CMS SignedData and the GOST algorithms have been addressed.
  * Additional Features and Functionality:
    - PKCS12 key stores containing only certificates can now be created
      without the need to provide passwords.
    - BCJSSE: Initial support for AlgorithmConstraints; protocol versions
      and cipher suites.

      versions and cipher suites.

      the provider and the light-weight API
    - XMSS/XMSS^MT key management now allows for allocating subsets of the
      private key space using the extraKeyShard() method. Use of
      StateAwareSignature is now deprecated.
    - Support for Java 11's NamedParameterSpec class has been added
      (using reflection) to the EC and EdEC KeyPairGenerator implementations.
