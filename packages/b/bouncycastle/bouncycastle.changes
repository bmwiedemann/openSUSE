Mon Nov  4 10:49:54 UTC 2024 - Pedro Monreal <pmonreal@suse.com>

- Update to 1.79:
  * Defects Fixed:
    - Leading zeroes were sometimes dropped from Ed25519 signatures
      leading to verification errors in the PGP API.
    - Default version string for Armored Output is now set correctly in 18on build.
    - The Elephant cipher would fail on large messages.
    - CMSSignedData.replaceSigners() would re-encode the digest algorithms
      block, occassionally dropping ones where NULL had been previously
      added as an algorithm parameter. The method now attempts to only use
      the original digest algorithm identifiers.
    - ERSInputStreamData would fail to generate the correct hash if
      called a second time with a different hash algorithm.
    - A downcast in the CrlCache which would cause FTP based CRLs to fail
      to load has been removed.
    - ECUtil.getNamedCurveOid() now trims curve names of excess space
      before look up.
    - The PhotonBeetle and Xoodyak digests did not reset properly after
      a doFinal() call.
    - Malformed AlgorithmIdentifiers in CertIDs could cause caching
      issues in the OCSP cache.
    - With Java 21 a provider service class will now be returned with
      a null class name where previously a null would have been returned
      for a service. This can cause a NullPointerException to be thrown
      by the BC provider if a non-existant service is requested.
    - CMS: OtherKeyAttribute.keyAttr now treated as optional.
    - CMS: EnvelopedData and AuthEnvelopedData could calculate the wrong versions.
    - The default version header for PGP armored output did not carry
      the correct version string.
    - In some situations the algorithm lookup for creating PGPDigestCalculators
      would fail due to truncation of the algorithm name.
  * Additional Features and Functionality:
    - Object Identifiers have been added for ML-KEM, ML-DSA, and SLH-DSA.
    - The PQC algorithms, ML-KEM, ML-DSA (including pre-hash), and SLH-DSA
      (including pre-hash) have been added to the BC provider and the lightweight API.
    - A new spec, ContextParameterSpec, has been added to support
      signature contexts for ML-DSA and SLH-DSA.
    - BCJSSE: Added support for security property
      "jdk.tls.server.defaultDHEParameters" (disabled in FIPS mode).
    - BCJSSE: Added support for signature_algorithms_cert configuration via
      "org.bouncycastle.jsse.client.SignatureSchemesCert" and
      "org.bouncycastle.jsse.server.SignatureSchemesCert" system properties
      or BCSSLParameters property "SignatureSchemesCert".
    - BCJSSE: Added support for boolean system property
      "org.bouncycastle.jsse.fips.allowGCMCiphersIn12" (false by default).
    - (D)TLS: Remove redundant verification of self-generated RSA signatures.
    - CompositePrivateKeys now support the latest revision of the composite
      signature draft.
    - Delta Certificates now support the latest revision of the delta
      certificate extension draft.
    - A general KeyIdentifier class, encapsulating both PGP KeyID and the
      PGP key fingerprint has been added to the PGP API.
    - Support for the LibrePGP PreferredEncryptionModes signature subpacket
      has been added to the PGP API.
    - Support for Version 6 signatures, including salts, has been added to the PGP API.
    - Support for the PreferredKeyServer signature supacket has been added to the PGP API.
    - Support for RFC 9269, "Using KEMs in Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS)",
      has been added to the CMS API.
    - Support for the Argon2 S2K has been added to the PGP API.
    - The system property "org.bouncycastle.pemreader.lax" has been introduced
      for situations where the BC PEM parsing is now too strict.
    - The system property "org.bouncycastle.ec.disable_f2m" has been introduced
      to allow F2m EC support to be disabled.
  * Rebase bouncycastle-notests.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr 29 16:07:27 UTC 2024 - Fridrich Strba <fstrba@suse.com>

- Update to version 1.78.1
  * Defects Fixed:
    - The new dependency of the the PGP API on the bcutil jar was
      missing from the module jar, the OSGi manifest, and the Maven
      POM. This has been fixed.
    - Missing exports and duplicate imports have been added/removed
      from the OSGi manifests.
    - The OSGi manifests now have the same bundle IDs as 1.77 and
      lock down dependencies to the equivalent variations
    - A check in the X.509 Extensions class preventing the parsing
      of empty extensions has been removed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr 29 06:39:43 UTC 2024 - Pedro Monreal <pmonreal@suse.com>

    - BCJSSE: Fixed a missing null check on the result of PrivateKey.getEncoded(),
      which could cause issues for HSM RSA keys.
    - BCJSSE: When endpoint identification is enabled and an SSL socket is not
      created with an explicit hostname (as happens with HttpsURLConnection),
      hostname verification could be performed against a DNS-resolved IP address.
    - The missing module import of java.logging to the provider module has been added.
    - GOST ASN.1 public key alg parameters are now compliant with RFC 9215.
    - An off-by-one error in the encoding for EccP256CurvePoint for ITS.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec  4 13:44:16 UTC 2023 - Pedro Monreal <pmonreal@suse.com>

- Update to version 1.77:
  * Defects Fixed:
    - Using an unescaped '=' in an X.500 RDN would result in the
      RDN being truncated silently. The issue is now detected and
      an exception is thrown.
    - asn1.eac.CertificateBody was returning certificateEffectiveDate
      from getCertificateExpirationDate(). This has been fixed to
      return certificateExpirationDate.
    - DTLS: Fixed retransmission in response to re-receipt of an
      aggregated ChangeCipherSpec.
    - (D)TLS: Fixed compliance for supported_groups extension.
      Server will no longer negotiate an EC cipher suite using a
      default curve when the ClientHello includes the supported_groups
      extension but it contains no curves in common with the server.
      Similarly, a DH cipher suite will not be negotiated when the
      ClientHello includes supported_groups, containing at least one
      FFDHE group, but none in common with the server.
    - IllegalStateException was being thrown by Ed25519/Ed448 SignatureSpi.
    - TLS: class annotation issues that could occur between the BC
      provider and the TLS API for the GCMParameterSpec class when
      the jars were loaded on the boot class path have been addressed.
    - Attempt to create an ASN.1 OID from a zero length byte array
      is now caught at construction time.
    - Attempt to create an X.509 extension block which is empty will
      now be blocked cause an exception.
    - IES implementation will now accept a null ParameterSpec if no
      nonce is needed.
    - An internal method in Arrays was failing to construct its
      failure message correctly on an error.
    - HSSKeyPublicParameters.generateLMSContext() would fail for a
      unit depth key.
  * Additional Features and Functionality:
    - BCJSSE: Added org.bouncycastle.jsse.client.omitSigAlgsCertExtension
      and org.bouncycastle.jsse.server.omitSigAlgsCertExtension boolean
      system properties to control (for client and server resp.) whether
      the signature_algorithms_cert extension should be omitted if it
      would be identical to signature_algorithms. Defaults to true, the
      historical behaviour.
    - The low-level HPKE API now allows the sender to specify an
      ephemeral key pair.
    - Support has been added for the delta-certificate requests in line
      with the current Chameleon Cert draft from the IETF.
    - Some accommodation has been added for historical systems to
      accommodate variations in the SHA-1 digest OID for CMS SignedData.
    - TLS: the TLS API will now try "RSAwithDigestAndMFG1" as well as
      the newer RSAPSS algorithm names when used with the JCA.
    - TLS: RSA key exchange cipher suites are now disabled by default.
    - Support has been added for PKCS#10 requests to allow certificates
      using the altSignature/altPublicKey extensions.
  * Notes:
    - Kyber and Dilithium have been updated according to the latest
      draft of the standard. Dilithium-AES and Kyber-AES have now been
      removed. Kyber now produces 256 bit secrets for all parameter sets
      (in line with the draft standard).
    - NTRU has been updated to produce 256 bit secrets in line with Kyber.
    - SPHINCS+ can now be used to generate certificates in line with
      those used by (Open Quantum Safe) OQS.
    - Falcon object idenitifiers are now in line with OQS as well.
    - PQC CMS SignedData now defaults to SHA-256 for signed attributes
      rather than SHAKE-256. This is also a compatibility change, but may
      change further again as the IETF standard for CMS is updated.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct 18 13:28:47 UTC 2023 - Pedro Monreal <pmonreal@suse.com>

- Update to version 1.76:
  * Defects Fixed:
    - Service allocation in the provider could fail due to the lack
      of a permission block. This has been fixed.
    - JceKeyFingerPrintCalculator has been generalised for different
      providers by using "SHA-256" for the algorithm string.
    - BCJSSE: Fixed a regression in 1.74 (NullPointerException) that
      prevents a BCJSSE server from negotiating TLSv1.1 or earlier.
    - DTLS: Fixed server support for client_certificate_type extension.
    - Cipher.unwrap() for HQC could fail due to a miscalculation of
      the length of the KEM packet. This has been fixed.
    - There was exposure to a Java 7 method in the Java 5 to Java 8
      BCTLS jar which could cause issues with some TLS 1.2 cipher
      suites running on older JVMs. This is now fixed.
  * Additional Features and Functionality:
    - BCJSSE: Following OpenJDK, finalizers have been removed from
      SSLSocket subclasses. Applications should close sockets and
      not rely on garbage collection.
    - BCJSSE: Added support for boolean system property
      "jdk.tls.client.useCompatibilityMode" (default "true").
    - DTLS: Added server support for session resumption.
    - JcaPKCS10CertificationRequest will now work with EC on the
      OpenJDK provider.
    - TimeStamp generation now supports the SHA3 algorithm set.
    - The SPHINCS+ simple parameters are now fully supported in the
      BCPQC provider.
    - Kyber, Classic McEliece, HQC, and Bike now supported by the
      CRMF/CMS/CMP APIs.
    - Builder classes have been add for PGP ASCII Armored streams
      allowing CRCs and versions to now be optional.
    - An UnknownPacket type has been added to the PGP APIs to allow
      for forwards compatibility with upcoming revisions to the standard.
  * Rebase patch bouncycastle-notests.patch

- Update to version 1.75:
  * Defects Fixed:
    - Several Java 8 method calls were accidentally introduced in
      the Java 5 to Java 8 build. The affected classes have been
      refactored to remove this.
    - (D)TLS: renegotiation after resumption now fixed to avoid
      breaking connection.
  * Notes:
    - The ASN.1 core package has had some dead and retired methods
      cleaned up and removed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun 19 10:26:53 UTC 2023 - Pedro Monreal <pmonreal@suse.com>

- Update to version 1.74: [bsc#1212508, CVE-2023-33201]
  * Defects Fixed:
    - AsconEngine: Fixed a buffering bug when decrypting across
      multiple processBytes calls (ascon128a unaffected).
    - Context based sanity checking on PGP signatures has been added.
    - The ParallelHash clone constructor was not copying all fields.
    - The maximimum number of blocks for CTR/SIC modes was 1 block
      less than it should have been.
  * Additional Features and Functionality:
    - The PGP API now supports wildcard key IDs for public key
      based data encryption.
    - LMS now supports SHA256/192, SHAKE256/192, and SHAKE256/256
      (the additional SP 8000-208 parameter sets).
    - The PGP API now supports V5 and V6 AEAD encryption for
      encrypted data packets.
    - The PGP examples have been updated to reflect key size and algorithm
      changes that have occurred since they were first written (10+ years...).
    - (D)TLS: A new callback 'TlsPeer.notifyConnectionClosed' will be called
      when the connection is closed (including by failure).
    - BCJSSE: Improved logging of connection events and include unique IDs
      in connection-specific log messages.
    - BCJSSE: Server now logs the offered cipher suites when it fails to
      select one.
    - BCJSSE: Added support for SSLParameters namedGroups and
      signatureSchemes properties (can also be used via BCJSSE
      extension API in earlier Java versions).
    - DTLS: The initial handshake re-send time is now configurable by
      overriding 'TlsPeer.getHandshakeResendTimeMillis'.
    - DTLS: Added support for connection IDs per RFC 9146.
    - DTLS: Performance of DTLSVerifier has been improved so that it can
      reasonably be used for all incoming packets.
    - Initial support has been added for A Mechanism for Encoding
      Differences in Paired Certificates.
    - The PGP API now supports parsing, encoding, and fingerprinting
      of V6 EC/EdEC keys.
    - A thread safe verifier API has been added to the PGP API to support
      multi-threaded verification of certifications on keys and user IDs.
    - The number of keys/sub-keys in a PGPKeyRing can now be found by
      calling PGPKeyRing.size().
    - The PQC algorithms LMS/HSS, SPHINCS+, Dilithium, Falcon, and NTRU
      are now supported directly by the BC provider.
  * Notes:
    - The now defunct PQC SIKE algorithm has been removed, this has also
      meant the removal of its resource files so the provider is now quite
      a bit smaller.
    - As a precaution, HC128 now enforces a 128 bit IV, previous behaviour
      for shorter IVs can be supported where required by padding the IV to
      the 128 bits with zero.
    - PGP encrypted data generation now uses integrity protection by default.
      Previous behaviour for encrypted data can be supported where required
      by calling PGPDataEncryptorBuilder.setWithIntegrityPacket(false) when
      data encryption is set up.
    - There are now additional sanity checks in place to prevent accidental
      mis-use of PGPSignature objects. If this change causes any issues, you
      might want to check what your code is up to as there is probably a bug.
  * Security Advisories:
    - CVE-2023-33201: this release fixes an issue with the X509LDAPCertStoreSpi
      where a specially crafted certificate subject could be used to try and
      extract extra information out of an LDAP server with wild-card matthing
      enabled.
  * Rebase bouncycastle-javadoc.patch
  * Add bouncycastle-notests.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr 25 10:26:27 UTC 2023 - Pedro Monreal <pmonreal@suse.com>

- Update to version 1.73: [jsc#PED-3756]
  * Defects Fixed:
    - BCJSSE: Instantiating a JSSE provider in some contexts could
      cause an AccessControl exception.
    - The EC key pair generator can generate out of range private
      keys when used with SM2. A specific SM2KeyPairGenerator has
      been added to the low-level API and is used by
      KeyPairGenerator.getInstance("SM2", "BC"). The SM2 signer has
      been updated to check for out of range keys as well..
    - The attached signature type byte was still present in Falcon
      signatures as well as the detached signature byte.
    - There was an off-by-one error in engineGetOutputSize() for ECIES.
    - The method for invoking read() internally in BCPGInputStream
      could result in inconsistent behaviour if the class was extended.
    - Fixed a rounding issue with FF1 Format Preserving Encryption
      algorithm for certain radices.
    - Fixed RFC3394WrapEngine handling of 64 bit keys.
    - Internal buffer for blake2sp was too small and could result in
      an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.
    - JCA PSS Signatures using SHAKE128 and SHAKE256 now support
      encoding of algorithm parameters.
    - PKCS10CertificationRequest now checks for empty extension
      parameters.
    - Parsing errors in the processing of PGP Armored Data now throw
      an explicit exception ArmoredInputException.
    - PGP AEAD streams could occassionally be truncated.
    - The ESTService class now supports processing of chunked HTTP data.
    - A constructed ASN.1 OCTET STRING with a single member would
      sometimes be re-encoded as a definite-length OCTET STRING. The
      encoding has been adjusted to preserve the BER status of the object.
    - PKIXCertPathReviewer could fail if the trust anchor was also
      included in the certificate store being used for path analysis.
    - UTF-8 parsing of an array range ignored the provided length.
    - IPAddress has been written to provide stricter checking and
      avoid the use of Integer.parseInt().
    - A Java 7 class snuck into the Java 5 to Java 8 build.
  * Additional Features and Functionality:
    - The Rainbow NIST Post Quantum Round-3 Candidate has been added to
      the low-level API and the BCPQC provider (level 3 and level 5
      parameter sets only).
    - The GeMSS NIST Post Quantum Round-3 Candidate has been added to
      the low-level API.
    - The org.bouncycastle.rsa.max_mr_tests property check has been
      added to allow capping of MR tests done on RSA moduli.
    - Significant performance improvements in PQC algorithms,
      especially BIKE, CMCE, Frodo, HQC, Picnic.
    - EdDSA verification now conforms to the recommendations of Taming
      the many EdDSAs, in particular cofactored verification. As a side
      benefit, Pornin's basis reduction is now used for EdDSA
      verification, giving a significant performance boost.
    - Major performance improvements for Anomalous Binary (Koblitz) Curves.
    - The lightweight Cryptography finalists Ascon, ISAP, Elephant,
      PhotonBeetle, Sparkle, and Xoodyak have been added to the
      light-weight cryptography API.
    - BLAKE2bp and BLAKE2sp have been added to the light-weight
      cryptography API.
    - Support has been added for X.509, Section 9.8, hybrid certificates
      and CRLs using alternate public keys and alternate signatures.
    - The property "org.bouncycastle.emulate.oracle" has been added to
      signal the provider should return algorithm names on some algorithms
      in the same manner as the Oracle JCE provider.
    - An extra replaceSigners method has been added to CMSSignedData
      which allows for specifying the digest algorithm IDs to be used
      in the new CMSSignedData object.
    - Parsing and re-encoding of ASN.1 PEM data has been further
      optimized to prevent unecessary conversions between basic encoding,
      definite length, and DER.
    - Support has been added for KEM ciphers in CMS in accordance with
      draft-ietf-lamps-cms-kemri
    - Support has been added for certEncr in CRMF to allow issuing of
      certificates for KEM public keys.
    - Further speedups have been made to CRC24.
    - GCMParameterSpec constructor caching has been added to improve
      performance for JVMs that have the class available.
    - The PGPEncrytedDataGenerator now supports injecting the session
      key to be used for PGP PBE encrypted data.
    - The CRMF CertificateRequestMessageBuilder now supports optional
      attributes.
    - Improvements to the s calculation in JPAKE.
    - A general purpose PQCOtherInfoGenerator has been added which
      supports all Kyber and NTRU.
    - An implementation of HPKE (RFC 9180 - Hybrid Public Key
      Encryption) has been added to the light-weight cryptography API.
  * Security Advisories:
    - The PQC implementations have now been subject to formal review for
      secret leakage and side channels, there were issues in BIKE, Falcon,
      Frodo, HQC which have now been fixed. Some weak positives also
      showed up in Rainbow, Picnic, SIKE, and GeMSS - for now this last
      set has been ignored as the algorithms will either be updated if
      they reappear in the Signature Round, or deleted, as is already the
      case for SIKE (it is now in the legacy package). Details on the
      group responsible for the testing can be found in the CONTRIBUTORS
      file.
    - For at least some ECIES variants (e.g. when using CBC) there is
      an issue with potential malleability of a nonce (implying silent
      malleability of the plaintext) that must be sent alongside the
      ciphertext but is outside the IES integrity check. For this reason
      the automatic generation of nonces with IED is now disabled and
      they have to be passed in using an IESParameterSpec. The current
      advice is to agree on a nonce between parties and then rely on the
      use of the ephemeral key component to allow the nonce (rather the
      so called nonce) usage to be extended.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct 19 12:09:48 UTC 2022 - Pedro Monreal <pmonreal@suse.com>

- Update to version 1.72:
  * Defects Fixed:
    - There were parameter errors in XMSS^MT OIDs for
      XMSSMT_SHA2_40/4_256 and XMSSMT_SHA2_60/3_256. These have
      been fixed.
    - There was an error in Merkle tree construction for the
      Evidence Records (ERS) implementation which could result in
      invalid roots been timestamped. ERS now produces an
      ArchiveTimeStamp for each data object/group with an associated
      reduced hash tree. The reduced hash tree is now calculated as
      a simple path to the root of the tree for each record.
    - OpenPGP will now ignore signatures marked as non-exportable
      on encoding.
    - A tagging calculation error in GCMSIV which could result in
      incorrect tags has been fixed.
    - Issues around Java 17 which could result in failing tests
      have been addressed.
  * Additional Features and Functionality:
    - BCJSSE: TLS 1.3 is now enabled by default where no explicit
      protocols are supplied (e.g. "TLS" or "Default" SSLContext
      algorithms, or SSLContext.getDefault() method).
    - BCJSSE: Rewrite SSLEngine implementation to improve compatibility
      with SunJSSE.
    - BCJSSE: Support export of keying material via extension API.
    - (D)TLS: Add support for 'tls-exporter' channel binding per RFC 9266.
    - (D)TLS (low-level API): By default, only (D)TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 are
      offered now. Earlier versions are still supported if explicitly
      enabled. Users may need to check they are offering suitable
      cipher suites for TLS 1.3.
    - (D)TLS (low-level API): Add support for raw public keys per RFC 7250.
    - CryptoServicesRegistrar now has a setServicesConstraints() method
      on it which can be used to selectively turn off algorithms.
    - The NIST PQC Alternate Candidate, Picnic, has been added to the low
      level API and the BCPQC provider.
    - SPHINCS+ has been upgraded to the latest submission, SPHINCS+ 3.1
      and support for Haraka has been added.
    - Evidence records now support timestamp renewal and hash renewal.
    - The SIKE Alternative Candidate NIST Post Quantum Algorithm has
      been added to the low-level PQC API.
    - The NTRU Round 3 Finalist Candidate NIST Post Quantum Algorithm
      has been added to the low-level API and the BCPQC provider.
    - The Falcon Finalist NIST Post Quantum Algorithm has been added to
      the low-level API and the BCPQC provider.
    - The CRYSTALS-Kyber Finalist NIST Post Quantum Algorithm has been
      added to the low-level API and the BCPQC provider.
    - Argon2 Support has been added to the OpenPGP API.
    - XDH IES has now been added to the BC provider.
    - The OpenPGP API now supports AEAD encryption and decryption.
    - The NTRU Prime Alternative Candidate NIST Post Quantum Algorithms
      have been added to the low-level API and the BCPQC provider.
    - The CRYSTALS-Dilithium Finalist NIST Post Quantum Algorithm has
      been added to the low-level API and the BCPQC provider.
    - The BIKE NIST Post Quantum Alternative/Round-4 Candidate has been
      added to the low-level API and the BCPQC provider.
    - The HQC NIST Post Quantum Alternative/Round-4 Candidate has been
      added to the low-level API and the BCPQC provider.
    - Grain128AEAD has been added to the lightweight API.
    - A fast version of CRC24 has been added for use with the PGP API.
    - Some additional methods and fields have been exposed in the
      PGPOnePassSignature class to (hopefully) make it easier to
      deal with nested signatures.
    - CMP support classes have been updated to reflect the latest
      editions to the the draft RFC "Lightweight Certificate Management
      Protocol (CMP) Profile".
    - Support has been added to the PKCS#12 implementation for the
      Oracle trusted certificate attribute.
    - Performance of our BZIP2 classes has been improved.
  * Notes:
    - Keep in mind the PQC algorithms are still under development and
      we are still at least a year and a half away from published standards.
      This means the algorithms may still change so by all means experiment,
      but do not use the PQC algoritms for anything long term.
    - The legacy "Rainbow" and "McEliece" implementations have been
      removed from the BCPQC provider. The underlying classes are
      still present if required. Other legacy algorithm implementations
      can be found under the org.bouncycastle.pqc.legacy package.
  * Security Notes:
    - The PQC SIKE algorithm is provided for research purposes only.
      It should now be regarded as broken. The SIKE implementation
      will be withdrawn in BC 1.73. 
  * Rebase bouncycastle-javadoc.patch

Fri Apr 22 21:24:48 UTC 2022 - Anton Shvetz <shvetz.anton@gmail.com>

- Version update to 1.71
  * Defects Fixed
    - In line with GPG the PGP API now attempts to preserve
      comments containing non-ascii UTF8 characters.
    - An accidental partial dependency on Java 1.7 has been removed
      from the TLS API.
    - JcaPKIXIdentityBuilder would fail to process File objects
      correctly. This is now fixed.
    - Some byte[] parameters to the CMP API were not being
      defensively cloned to prevent accidental changes. Extra
      defensive cloning has been added.
    - CMS primitives would sometimes convert ASN.1 definite-length
      encodings into indefinite-length encodings. The primitives
      will now try and preserve the original encoding where possible.
    - CMSSignedData.getAttributeCertificates() now properly
      restricts the tag values checked to just 1 (the obsolete
      v1 tag) and 2 (for the more current v2 certificates).
    - BCJSSE now tries to validate a custom KeyManager selection
      in order to catch errors around a key manager ignoring
      key type early.
    - Compressed streams in PGP ending with zero length partial
      packets could cause failure on parsing the OpenPGP API.
      This has been fixed.
    - The fallback mode for JceAsymmetricKeyWrapper/Unwrapper
      would lose track of any algorithm parameters generated
      in the initial attempt. The algorithm parameters are now
      propagated.
    - An accidental regression introduced by a fix for another
      issue in PKIXCertPathReviewer around use of the
      AuthorityKeyIdentifier extension and it failing to match
      a certificate uniquely when the serial number field
      is missing has been fixed.
    - An error was found in the creation of TLS 1.3 Export Keying
      Material which could cause compatibility issues. This has
      been fixed.
  * Additional Features and Functionality
    - Support has been added for OpenPGP regular expression
      signature packets.

      customization string).
    - TupleHash128, TupleHash256 has been added to the BC provider
      (empty customization string).
    - ParallelHash128, ParallelHash256 has been added to the BC
      provider (empty customization string, block size 1024 bits).
    - Two new properties: "org.bouncycastle.rsa.max_size" (default
      15360) and "org.bouncycastle.ec.fp_max_size" (default 1042)
      have been added to cap the maximum size of RSA and EC keys.
    - RSA modulus are now checked to be provably composite using
      the enhanced MR probable prime test.
    - Imported EC Fp basis values are now validated against the MR
      prime number test before use. The certainty level of the
      prime test can be determined by
      "org.bouncycastle.ec.fp_certainty" (default 100).
    - The BC entropy thread now has a specific name:
      "BC-ENTROPY-GATHERER".
    - Utility methods have been added for joining/merging PGP
      public keys and signatures.
    - Blake3-256 has been added to the BC provider.

      definite-length data.
    - The NetscapeCertType class now has a hasUsages() method on it
      for querying usage settings on its bit string.
    - Support for additional input has been added for deterministic
      (EC)DSA.
    - The OpenPGP API provides better support for subkey
      generation.
    - BCJSSE: Added boolean system properties
      "org.bouncycastle.jsse.client.dh.disableDefaultSuites" and
      "org.bouncycastle.jsse.server.dh.disableDefaultSuites".
      Default "false". Set to "true" to disable inclusion of DH
      cipher suites in the default cipher suites for client/server
      respectively.
  * Notes
    - The deprecated QTESLA implementation has been removed from
      the BCPQC provider.
    - The submission update to SPHINCS+ has been added. This
      changes the generation of signatures - particularly
      deterministic ones.
- Version update to 1.70
  * Defects Fixed
    - Blake 3 output limit is enforced.
    - The PKCS12 KeyStore was relying on default precedence for its
      key Cipher implementation so was sometimes failing if used
      from the keytool. The KeyStore class now makes sure it uses
      the correct Cipher implementation.
    - Fixed bzip2 compression for empty contents (GH #993).
    - ASN.1: More robust handling of high tag numbers and
      definite-length forms.

      properly support all the variations of IESParameterSpec.
    - getOutputSize() for ECIES has been corrected to avoid
      occassional underestimates.
    - The lack of close() in the ASN.1 Dump command line utility
      was triggering false positives in some code analysis tools. A
      close() call has been added.
    - PGPPublicKey.getBitStrength() now properly recognises EdDSA
      keys.
  * Additional Features and Functionality
    - Missing PGP CRC checksums can now be optionally ignored using
      setDetectMissingCRC() (default false) on ArmoredInputStream.
    - PGPSecretKey.copyWithNewPassword() now has a variant which
      uses USAGE_SHA1 for key protection if a PGPDigestCalculator
      is passed in.
    - PGP ASCII armored data now skips "\t", "\v", and "\f".
    - PKCS12 files with duplicate localKeyId attributes on
      certificates will now have the incorrect attributes filtered
      out, rather than the duplicate causing an exception.
    - PGPObjectFactory will now ignore packets representing
      unrecognised signature versions in the input stream.
    - The X.509 extension generator will now accumulate some
      duplicate X.509 extensions into a single extension where it
      is possible to do so.
    - Removed support for maxXofLen in Kangaroo digest.
    - Ignore marker packets in PGP Public and Secret key ring
      collection.

      input into canonicalized literal data for text and UTF-8
      mode.
    - A getUserKeyingMaterial() method has been added to the
      KeyAgreeRecipientInformation class.
    - ASN.1: Tagged objects (and parsers) now support all tag
      classes. Special code for ApplicationSpecific has been
      deprecated and re-implemented in terms of TaggedObject.
    - ASN.1: Improved support for nested tagging.
    - ASN.1: Added support for GraphicString, ObjectDescriptor,
      RelativeOID.

      including efficient parsing for large values.
    - TLS: Added support for external PSK handshakes.
    - TLS: Check policy restrictions on key size when determining
      cipher suite support.
    - A performance issue in KeccakDigest due to left over debug
      code has been identified and dealt with.
    - BKS key stores can now be used for collecting protected keys
      (note: any attempt to store such a store will cause an
      exception).
    - A method for recovering user keying material has been added
      to KeyAgreeRecipientInformation.
    - Support has been added to the CMS API for SHA-3 based
      PLAIN-ECDSA.

      family of algorithms and the SM3 alogirthm.
    - PGPKeyRingGenerator now supports creation of key-rings with
      direct-key identified keys.
    - The PQC NIST candidate, signature algorithm SPHINCS+ has been
      added to the low-level API.
    - ArmoredInputStream now explicitly checks for a '\n' if in
      crLF mode.
    - Direct support for NotationDataOccurances, Exportable,
      Revocable, IntendedRecipientFingerPrints, and AEAD algorithm
      preferences has been added to PGPSignatureSubpacketVector.

      for adding additional digest algorithm identifiers to CMS
      SignedData structures when required.
    - Support has been added to CMS for the LMS/HSS signature
      algorithm.
    - The system property
      "org.bouncycastle.jsse.client.assumeOriginalHostName"
      (default false) has been added for dealing with SNI problems
      related to the host name not being propagate by the JVM.
    - The JcePKCSPBEOutputEncryptorBuilder now supports SCRYPT with
      ciphers that do not have algorithm parameters (e.g. AESKWP).
    - Support is now added for certificates using ETSI TS 103 097,
      "Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS)" in the bcpkix package.
  * Notes.
    - While this release should maintain source code compatibility,
      developers making use of some parts of the ASN.1 library will
      find that some classes need recompiling. Apologies for the
      inconvenience.
- Version update to 1.69
  * Defects Fixed
    - Lightweight and JCA conversion of Ed25519 keys in the PGP API
      could drop the leading byte as it was zero. This has been
      fixed.
    - Marker packets appearing at the start of PGP public key rings
      could cause parsing failure. This has been fixed.
    - ESTService could fail for some valid Content-Type headers.
      This has been fixed.
    - Originator key algorithm parameters were being passed as NULL
      in key agreement recipients. The parameters now reflect the
      value of the parameters in the key's SubjectPublicKeyInfo.
    - ContentType on encapsulated data was not been passed through
      correctly for authenticated and enveloped data. This has been
      fixed.
    - NTRUEncryptionParameters and
      NTRUEncryptionKeyGenerationParameters were not correctly
      cloning the contained message digest. This has been fixed.
    - CertificateFactory.generateCertificates()/generateCRLs()
      would throw an exception if extra data was found at the end
      of a PEM file even if valid objects had been found. Extra
      data is now ignored providing at least one object found.
    - Internal class PKIXCRLUtil could throw a NullPointerException
      for CRLs with an absent nextUpdate field. This has been
      fixed.
    - PGP ArmoredInputStream now fails earlier on malformed
      headers.
    - The McElieceKobaraImaiCipher was randomly throwing "Bad
      Padding: invalid ciphertext" exception while decrypting due
      to leading zeroes been missed during processing of the cipher
      text. This has been fixed.
    - Ed25519 keys being passed in via OpenSSH key spec are now
      validated in the KeyFactory.
    - Blowfish keys are now range checked on cipher construction.
    - In some cases PGPSecretKeyRing was failing to search its
      extraPubKeys list when searching for public keys.
    - The BasicConstraintsValidation class in the BC cert path
      validation tools has improved conformance to RFC 5280.
    - AlgorithmIdentifiers involving message digests now attempt to
      follow the latest conventions for the parameters field
      (basically DER NULL appears less).
    - Fix various conversions and interoperability for XDH and
      EdDSA between BC and SunEC providers.
    - TLS: Prevent attempts to use KeyUpdate mechanism in versions
      before TLS 1.3.

      mask generation function and digest.
    - ECDSA now supports the use of SHAKE128 and SHAKE256.
    - PGPPBEEncryptedData will now reset the stream if the initial
      checksum fails so another password can be tried.
    - Iterators on public and secret key ring collections in PGP
      now reflect the original order of the public/secret key rings
      they contain.
    - KeyAgreeRecipientInformation now has a getOriginator() method
      for retrieving the underlying orginator information.
    - PGPSignature now has a getDigestPrefix() method for people
      wanting exposure to the signature finger print details.
    - The old BKS-V1 format keystore is now disabled by default. If
      you need to use BKS-V1 for legacy reasons, it can be
      re-enabled by adding: org.bouncycastle.bks.enable_v1=true to
      the java.security file. We would be interested in hearing
      from anyone that needs to do this.
    - PLAIN-ECDSA now supports the SHA3 digests.
    - Some highlevel support for RFC 4998 ERS has been added for
      ArchiveTimeStamp and EvidenceRecord. The new classes are in
      the org.bouncycastle.tsp.ers package.

      with a primary key binding signature.
    - Support for ASN.1 PRIVATE tags has been added.
    - Performance enhancements to Nokeon, AES, GCM, and
      SICBlockCipher.

      (default is 'false').
    - BCJSSE: Added support for jdk.tls.client.cipherSuites system
      property.
    - BCJSSE: Added support for jdk.tls.server.cipherSuites system
      property.

  * Notes
    - There is a small API change in the PKIX package to the
      DigestAlgorithmIdentifierFinder interface as a find() method
      that takes an ASN1ObjectIdentifier has been added to it. For
      people wishing to extend their own implementations, see
      DefaultDigestAlgorithmIdentifierFinder for a sample
      implementation.
    - A version of the bcmail API supporting Jakarta Mail has now
      been added (see bcjmail jar).
    - Some work has been done on moving out code that does not need
      to be in the provider jar. This has reduced the size of the
      provider jar and should also make it easier for developers to
      patch the classes involved as they no longer need to be
      signed. bcpkix and bctls are both dependent on the new bcutil
      jar.
- Add build dependencies on
  mvn(jakarta.activation:jakarta.activation-api) and
  mvn(jakarta.mail:jakarta.mail-api)
- Remove unneeded script bouncycastle_getpoms.sh from sources

Wed Jan 13 09:44:54 UTC 2021 - Fridrich Strba <fstrba@suse.com>

- Version update to 1.68
  * Defects Fixed:
    - Some BigIntegers utility methods would fail for
      BigInteger.ZERO. This has been fixed.
    - PGPUtil.isKeyRing() was not detecting secret sub-keys in its
      input. This has been fixed.
    - The ASN.1 class, ArchiveTimeStamp was insisting on a value
      for the optional reducedHashTree field. This has been fixed.
    - BCJSSE: Lock against multiple writers - a possible
      synchronization issue has been removed.
  * Additional Features and Functionality
    - BCJSSE: Added support for system property
      com.sun.net.ssl.requireCloseNotify. Note that we are using a
      default value of 'true'.
    - BCJSSE: 'TLSv1.3' is now a supported protocol for both client
      and server. For this release it is only enabled by default for
      the 'TLSv1.3' SSLContext, but can be explicitly enabled using
      'setEnabledProtocols' on an SSLSocket or SSLEngine, or via
      SSLParameters.
    - BCJSSE: Session resumption is now also supported for servers
      in TLS 1.2 and earlier. For this release it is disabled by
      default, and can be enabled by setting the boolean system
      property org.bouncycastle.jsse.server.enableSessionResumption
      to 'true'.
    - The provider RSA-PSS signature names that follow the JCA
      naming convention.
    - FIPS mode for the BCJSSE now enforces namedCurves for any
      presented certificates.
    - PGPSignatureSubpacketGenerator now supports editing of a
      pre-existing sub-packet list.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec 21 10:54:33 UTC 2020 - Pedro Monreal <pmonreal@suse.com>

- Version update to 1.67 [bsc#1180215, CVE-2020-28052]
  * CVE-2020-28052: OpenBSDBCrypt.checkPassword utility method
    compared incorrect data when checking the password
  * Defects Fixed:
    - BCJSSE: SunJSSE compatibility fix - override of getChannel()
      removed and 'urgent data' behaviour should now conform to
      what the SunJSSE expects
    - Nested BER data could sometimes cause issues in octet strings
    - Certificates/CRLs with short signatures could cause an exception
      in toString() in the BC X509 Certificate implmentation
    - In line with latest changes in the JVM, SignatureSpis which
      don't require parameters now return null on engineGetParameters()
    - The RSA KeyFactory now always preferentially produces RSAPrivateCrtKey
      where it can on requests for a KeySpec based on an RSAPrivateKey
    - CMSTypedStream$FullReaderStream now handles zero length reads correctly
    - Unecessary padding was added on KMAC when the key string was block aligned
    - Zero length data would cause an unexpected exception from RFC5649WrapEngine
    - OpenBSDBcrypt was failing to handle some valid prefixes
  * Additional Features and Functionality
    - Performance improvement of Argon2 and Noekeon
    - A setSessionKeyObfuscation() method has been added to
      PublicKeyKeyEncryptionMethodGenerator to allow turning off of session key
      obfuscation (default is on, method primarily to get around early version
      GPG issues with AES-128 keys)
    - Implemented 'safegcd' constant-time modular inversion (as well as a
      variable-time variant). It has replaced Fermat inversion in all our EC
      code, and BigInteger.modInverse in several other places, particularly

      the EdECKey and XECKey interfaces directly
    - Work has begun on classes to support the ETSI TS 103 097, Intelligent
      Transport Systems (ITS) in the bcpkix package

      added for trying to "quantum hard" KEM algorithms
    - PGP clear signed signatures now support SHA-224
    - Treating absent vs NULL as equivalent can now be configured by a system
      property. By default this is not enabled
    - Mode name checks in Cipher strings should now make sure an improper mode
      name always results in a NoSuchAlgorithmException
    - In line with changes in OpenSSL, the OpenSSLPBKDF now uses UTF8 encoding
