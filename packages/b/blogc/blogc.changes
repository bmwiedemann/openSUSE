- Update to 0.17.0:
  * blogc(1) now supports sorting source files by DATE variable,
    by providing the FILTER_SORT=1 global variable.

	can be reversed by providing the FILTER_REVERSE=1 global variable.
	See blogc-pagination(7) for details.

  * blogc-make(1) was implementing atom feeds wrong for long time.
  * atom_legacy_entry_id isn't supported by blogcfile(5) anymore.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr 15 08:33:07 UTC 2019 - mvetter@suse.com

- Update to 0.16.0:
  * Added new template block listing_entry, to include the content
    of a source file on a listing page. This is useful if the user
    wants to have an index page with posts listing and some content
    together. See blogc(1) (description of -e option) and
    blogc-template(7) for details.
  * Adapted blogc-make(1) to support the new listing_entry block.
    See blogcfile(5) for details.
  * Changed blogc(1)-p option to be able to retrieve values from
    entries, instead of just listings. Any variables that can be used
    in templates are available, including CONTENT, that contains
    the HTML generated from the source file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb 27 08:58:52 UTC 2019 - mvetter@suse.com

- Update to 0.15.1:
  * Backslashes won't escape inline code in source files, to be
    more compatible with Markdown spec. To escape a back-tick
    character inside inline code, please enclose the code with double back-ticks.
  * Simplified implementation of BLOGC_SYSINFO_USERNAME template
    variable, to prevent issues with static builds in glibc, due to
    some functions requiring shared libraries even when built statically.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb 12 08:41:37 UTC 2019 - mvetter@suse.com

- Update to 0.15.0:
  * Includes some predefined internal template variables, to show
    some build metadata in websites. See blogc-template(7) for details.
  * Fixes a bug when using whitespace characters like \r, \n
    and \t in template blocks, conditionals and variables, instead
    of just spaces (' '). These characters where not allowed previously.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 17 11:55:49 UTC 2019 - mvetter@suse.com

- Update to 0.14.1:
  * Minor code improvements in blogc-make and blogc-git-receiver
  * Fixed a bug in blogc-make handling of rule names. Previously
    it would accept incomplete rule names, but would run all the
    rules that matched that substring, e.g. atom would match atom,
    atom_tags, atom_dump, and run all of them in sequence.
    Now it will only match the exact rule names.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul 27 10:03:50 UTC 2018 - mvetter@suse.com

- Update to 0.14.0:
  * Allow usage of empty values for the *_prefix settings in blogcfile(5)
  * Fixed some bugs in the default Atom feed template.
    This includes a change in the algorithm that generates Atom
    IDs for every post. Users upgrading to this version may want to set
    atom_legacy_entry_id to true in blogcfile(5), to avoid
    re-sharing posts due to the ID changes.
  * Allow usage of custom Atom feed templates. Users can dump the
    default template to use as base for customizations, using
    blogc-make(1)atom_dump rule.
  * Minor fixes to prevent segfaults.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul 23 07:19:24 UTC 2018 - mvetter@suse.com

    fault in blogc-git-receiver(1)'s pre-receive hook, that was
    introduced in the previous release.
- Changes in 0.13.7:
  * Users can now run blogc-git-receiver(1) in shared hosting
    enviromnents, if they have SSH access.
  * If atom_posts_per_page and posts_per_page settings for
    blogc-make(1) are set to zero, index listings and Atom feeds
    are not built, instead of producing "empty" files.
  * Fixed some other minor issues.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

    of the automatic website reloader/rebuilder without using
    blogc-runserver(1).
  * Changed the architecture of the blogc-make(1)runserver rule.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- Update to 0.13.4:
  Minor release with bug-fixes and a minor blogc-make feature:
  * When running commands, blogc-make(1) will show the command's 
    STDERR always, to avoid suppressing blogc(1)
    warnings.

    pagination features are disabled, and all the posts are
    included in the template listing blocks.
