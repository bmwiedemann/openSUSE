  <title>Mission and Objective based 2D Platform Game</title>
  <description>Blob Wars : Metal Blob Solid. This is Episode I of the Blob Wars Saga.
This is a platform game, not unlike those found on the Amiga and SNES.
The object of the game is to take on the role of solider Blob, Bob,
and play through the various levels and attempt to rescue as many MIA
(Missing In Action) Blobs as possible. This is not quite as straight
forward as it sounds, since the MIAs will often be not directly
reachable and will require some extra thought. Bob also has to
contend with environmental hazards, alien invaders and assimilated Blobs.</description>
