  <title>3D Networked Multiplayer Tank Battle Game</title>
  <description>BZFlag is a 3D multiplayer tank battle game that allows users to play
against each other in a networked environment. Because it makes heavy
use of 3D graphics (OpenGL), a fast CPU or a supported 3D video card is
heavily recommended.
