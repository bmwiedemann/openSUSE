  <title>BLAS-like Library Instantiation Software Framework</title>
  <description>BLIS is a portable software framework for instantiating high-performance
BLAS-like dense linear algebra libraries. The framework was designed to isolate
essential kernels of computation that, when optimized, immediately enable
optimized implementations of most of its commonly used and computationally
intensive operations. BLIS is written in ISO C99.
