%description
Add useful and nice-looking widgets to your interfaces with the BWidget
Toolkit, a set of native Tk 8.x Widgets using Tcl8.x namespaces. The
BWidgets have a professional look and feel as in other well-known
toolkits (Tix or Incr Widget). However, the concept is radically
different because everything is native. There is no platform
compilation and no compiled extension libraries are needed. The code is
in pure Tcl/Tk.
