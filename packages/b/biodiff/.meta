  <title>A tool for binary diffing</title>
  <description>Hex diff viewer using alignment algorithms from biology.

The tool is able to show two binary files side by side so that similar
places will be at the same position on both sides and bytes missing
from one side are padded. It uses bio-informatics algorithms from the
rust-bio library (typically used for DNA sequence alignment) for that.

Features
 - Unaligned view for moving both sides independently as contiguous
   byte segments.
 - Aligned view for comparing corresponding bytes of both files.
 - Many configurable byte representations (bases 2, 8, 10, 16;
   mixed ascii/hex, braille, roman numerals).
 - Right-to-left mode, horizontal and vertical split, ascii and bar
   column.
 - bytes per row, adjustable by pressing [, ], 0.
 - Automatic determination of width by finding repetitions in
   visible/selected bytes by pressing '='.
 - Search using text, regex and hexagex.
