- update to version 5.49:
  This is mostly a bug fix release, with fixes to features such as
  AVCTP, OBEX, GATT and Mesh. There are however some notable new
  features also, such as improved heartbeat management support in

Fri Dec 29 17:21:34 UTC 2017 - seife+obs@b1-systems.com

- update to version 5.48:
  This release brings many fixes and feature enhancements.
  Some notable enhancements include support for devices with the
  BLE battery service, as well as improved Mesh support in the
  meshctl tool. Several previously experimental D-Bus APIs have now
  been marked as stable, notably the Advertising Manager API as
  well as the AquireWrite & AquireNotify GATT APIs.
  As far as fixes go, these can be found in many areas of the stack,
  including A2DP, AVCTP, device discovery, Mesh, and GATT.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Sep 17 22:34:07 UTC 2017 - seife+obs@b1-systems.com

- update to version 5.47:
  This release contains various fixes to GATT, A2DP and BR/EDR vs
  LE bearer handling. There’s also a notable SDP fix for CVE-2017-
  1000250 (part of the recently announced BlueBorne vulnerabilities).
  Feature-wise, there’s now support for adding the appearance and
  local name to advertising data through the Advertising D-Bus
  interface. The btmon tool is now also able to better decode most
  Bluetooth 5.0 HCI commands and events.
  The Bluetooth Mesh Profile specification was released recently,
  and this BlueZ release comes with initial support for it in the
  form of a new meshctl tool. Using this tool it’s possible to
  provision mesh devices through the GATT Provisioning Bearer
  (PB-GATT), as well as communicate with them (e.g. configure them)
  using the GATT Proxy protocol.

- update to version 5.45:
  This is mostly a bugfix release with fixes in ATT, GATT, OBEX
  and AVDTP.
  Feature-wise there are some new things as well, such as btmon
  support decoding Bluetooth 5.0 HCI commands and events.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Wed Mar  1 21:22:42 UTC 2017 - seife+obs@b1-systems.com

- update to version 5.44:
  Most fixes are LE (specifically GATT) related, however some other
  areas are affected as well.
  Feature-wise, there’s a new MIDI plugin and support for using
  single-mode (LE-only) controllers that lack a public address.
  E.g. any nRF5x controller running a MyNewt or Zephyr based
  firmware falls into this category.
- packaging: add "--enable-midi", "--enable-deprecated"

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Oct 29 09:23:59 UTC 2016 - seife+obs@b1-systems.com

- update to version 5.43:
  This is almost purely a bug-fix release with fixes to HoG, ATT
  and PAN. There’s also a fix for a regression in 5.42 that caused
  connection failures for external profiles like OBEX.
  Feature-wise there’s one notable addition: LE privacy. By
  enabling this in main.conf it’s now possible to make BlueZ
  generate a local Identity Resolving Key (IRK) and use Resolvable
  Private Addresses (RPAs) for itself.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 26 17:41:20 UTC 2016 - seife+obs@b1-systems.com

- update to version 5.42:
  The major API change with this release is that the GATT D-Bus API
  is no longer marked as experimental.This should hopefully
  encourage the creation of more applications using it. Feature-
  wise, btmon received support for decoding full mgmt message
  traces - a feature that is available in the bluetooth-next kernel
  tree, i.e. on its way to the 4.9 kernel release. In addition to
  these changes, this release contains also fixes in areas such as
  PBAP, transport selection (BR/EDR vs LE), ATT and A2DP.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jul 31 21:42:27 UTC 2016 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update descriptions a bit. Adjust RPM groups for what is used
  in openSUSE normally. Drop archaic %clean section.
  Drop --with-pic which is only for (unbuilt) static libs.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul 20 22:32:18 UTC 2016 - seife+obs@b1-systems.com

- update to version 5.41:
  BlueZ 5.41 is purely a bug-fix release targeting areas such as
  GATT, AVRCP, OBEX and device discovery filters. The GATT D-Bus
  API is now starting to be stable enough that this will likely be
  the last release where it is flagged as experimental.
- fix build with older distributions that don't have %_userunitdir
  ins systemd-rpm-macros

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun  7 13:17:48 UTC 2016 - fbui@suse.com

- Don't require systemd-devel but systemd-rpm-macros (bsc#983167)
  Bluez simply needs to know where the systemd default paths are, at
  build time. For that there's no need to build-require systemd or
  systemd-devel (and pull all theirs dependencies). Instead
  build-require systemd-rpm-macros, which has much less dependencies.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat May 28 07:33:16 UTC 2016 - seife+obs@b1-systems.com

- update to version 5.40:
  This is mostly a bug fix release fixing issues with GATT, paired
  devices and connection handling (particularly for accepting
  connections through the Profile D-Bus interface).
  One new feature is the ability to use btmon for reading HCI logs
  from a TTY device. Right now the creation of this kind of logs is
  available with Zephyr <https://www.zephyrproject.org/> in the
  form of a special console logging mode (more information
  available here
  https://www.zephyrproject.org/doc/board/arduino_101_ble.html#getting-hci-traces>).
  The format of the protocol is a slight modification of what btmon
  normally receives from the kernel monitor sockets, and is
  documented in doc/btsnoop.txt).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Apr 10 09:37:14 UTC 2016 - seife+obs@b1-systems.com

- update to version 5.39:
  This is almost entirely a bug fix release with important fixes to
  GATT, HoG, AVRCP & A2DP.
- install gatttool, needed for bluetooth 4.0 devices (boo#970628)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 18 14:22:39 UTC 2016 - seife+obs@b1-systems.com

- update to version 5.38:
  This release has lots of updates and fixes to the GATT D-Bus API.
  It should be working considerably better now. A key change to the
  GATT D-Bus API is that it is now fully conforming to the word of
  the D-Bus Object Manager specification. Instead of registering
  each service individually with an Object Manager interface per
  service path, all application services are now grouped together
  through a single RegisterApplication call. The details can be
  found in gatt-api.txt. Besides the D-Bus API change there are
  also numerous fixes to GATT functionality in general.
  Other areas that received fixes in this release are OBEX, AVRCP
  and 128-bit UUID handling. Feature-wise there isn’t anything
  groundbreaking, but a notable update is support for the Start
  Limited Discovery command in the btmgmt tool (this feature
  debuted with the 4.5 kernel release).
  * Fix issue with stack overflow and UUID handling.
  * Fix issue with ObjectManager interface and GATT.
  * Fix issue with GATT database and error handling.
  * Fix issue with GATT client notifications.
  * Fix issue with GATT object ordering.
  * Fix issue with GATT default MTU exchange.
  * Fix issue with device attribute clearing.
  * Fix issue with AVRCP capabilities request.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec 28 08:27:37 UTC 2015 - seife+obs@b1-systems.com

- update to version 5.37:
  * Fix issue with registering external profiles.
  * Fix issue with connecting external profiles.
  * Fix issue with GATT service changed handling.
  * Fix issue with not emitting GattServices update.
  * Convert to unified HID over GATT profile support.
  * Convert to KeyboardDisplay as default IO capability.
  * Install btattach utility by default.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct 30 08:11:30 UTC 2015 - seife+obs@b1-systems.com

- update to version 5.36:
  This release consists for the most part of bug fixes that target
  areas such as PBAP, AVRCP and GATT.
  Feature-wise a notable change is btmon support for vendor
  diagnostic messages which will be debuting with the 4.4 Linux
  kernel release. This feature will allow e.g. LMP tracing with
  specific controllers. For now there is preliminary support for
  Intel and Broadcom based controllers.
- update dbus-devel buildrequires from configure.ac
- remove obsolete bluez-no-duplicate-test-names.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 28 19:02:15 UTC 2015 - seife+obs@b1-systems.com

- update to version 5.35:
  This release contains bugfixes to areas such as GATT, OBEX, HoG
  and AVRCP. From now on bluetoothd will cache more information of
  remote GATT databases and thereby avoid unnecessary rediscovery
  of remote services.
  A noteworthy new feature is the ability to configure bluetoothd
  to automatically enable (power on) all new adapters. One use of
  this is to replace unreliable "hciconfig hci0 up" commands that
  some distributions use in their init/udev scripts. The feature
  can be enabled by having "AutoEnable=true" under the "[Policy]"
  section of /etc/bluetooth/main.conf

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 10 13:24:58 UTC 2015 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Add bluez-no-duplicate-test-names.patch: Fix test suite when
  running against GLIB 2.45.x (test names are not to be used
  duplicated).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep  4 10:39:32 UTC 2015 - seife+obs@b1-systems.com

- update to version 5.34:
  This release fixes a fairly important bug for the GATT D-Bus
  interface where automatic reconnections would not always occur
  for the client role. There’s also a fix for a missing attribute
  in PBAP & MAP SDP records as well as a couple of audio related
  fixes. A new feature in this release is Media Player Selection
  support for the Target role of AVRCP (the Controller role already
  had this).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul 31 12:24:09 UTC 2015 - seife+obs@b1-systems.com

- update to version 5.33:
  This release contains mostly bugfixes, particularly in areas such
  as the audio plugin, GATT and OBEX. The main feature additions
  are in the the emulator code which received improvelents to LE
  features. There’s also a new tool for testing the recently
  released Eddystone protocol from Google.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul  7 21:22:05 UTC 2015 - seife+obs@b1-systems.com

- update to version 5.32:
  This is mostly a bug fix release rather than including many new
  features. The fixes fall in several different areas, including
  OPP, ATT and advertising (instance number handling in
  particular). There’s also a fix for handling a sudden disconnect
  when a connection setup process hasn’t yet completed. The one
  notable feature this release has is the ability to select between
  letting the stack handle ATT security elevation or doing the
  respective error handling in higher layers.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun 16 05:39:22 UTC 2015 - seife+obs@b1-systems.com

- update to version 5.31
  Fixes to many different areas, including networking, GATT, HID,
  A2DP and AVRCP. Feature-wise we’ve got support for security flags
  for the GATT database, allowing fine-grained security level
  control for D-Bus clients using the GATT D-Bus API. We’ve also
  got a new experimental device discovery filter interface which
  allows filtering for a specific remote service, RSSI threshold
  or transport (LE vs. BR/EDR). Another new experimental interface
  is for LE advertising, which also brings the LE peripheral role
  closer to feature completion on a D-Bus level
- remove obsolete bluez-5.30-disable-broken-tests.diff

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr  1 10:35:59 UTC 2015 - seife+obs@b1-systems.com

- update to version 5.30
  The highlight of this release is the completion of the GATT D-Bus
  APIs. We’ve now got both the client and server functionality in
  place, however it’s still behind the -E (--experimental) command
  line switch. The API is documented in doc/gatt-api.txt and there
  are several test tools for it in the tree (even bluetoothctl has
  support for it). Another new (and still experimental) D-Bus API
  that debuts with this release is one for managing LE Advertising,
  i.e. acting in peripheral role. The API is documented in
  doc/advertising-api.txt.
  Besides the new features, there are several fixes to AVCTP, AVDTP
  & AVRCP.  There’s also a fix for C++ compiler compatibility with
  the library headers as well as a fix for device information not
  being stored in certain corner cases.
- add bluez-5.30-disable-broken-tests.diff to fix test suite
- remove -fstack-reuse=none workaround
- remove 20150312-PATCH_BlueZ_shared_gatt-client_Fix_invalid_read-56974.patch

  test setup.  [bnc#923768]

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar 12 12:03:30 UTC 2015 - seife+obs@b1-systems.com

- update to version 5.29
  This is a comparatively large release with over a month and 475
  commits since 5.28. There have been lots of fixes to the Android
  side. Our internal GATT library (used both by ‘normal’ BlueZ as
  well as the Android version) received lots of updates for this
  release. Other notable changes are a fix for AVCTP key repeat
  timeout as well as added support for the Multi Profile
  Specification (MPS).
- add 20150312-PATCH_BlueZ_shared_gatt-client_Fix_invalid_read-56974.patch
  from bluez-devel for fixing test case failure (will be included in
  next bluez release)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb  3 10:45:20 UTC 2015 - seife+obs@b1-systems.com

- update to version 5.28
  Here’s the first BlueZ release in 2015. Most of the changes since
  the last one are bug fixes, but there’s actually quite many of
  them this time, including:
  * Fixes to GATT service discovery & probing
  * Fix for bearer selection with dual-mode devices
  * Fix potential crash when removing devices
  * Fix issue with incomplete names in EIR data
  * Fix parsing GATT name characteristics
  * Fix AVCTP long press & key repetition handling
  * Fixes for GATT notification handling
  Besides bug fixes we’ve now also got more extensive unit tests
  for new GATT code as well as better HCI decoders in btmon for
  some less used 4.1 and 4.2 features. The hid2hci tool gained
  support for CSR 8510 A10 devices and the hex2hcd tool received a
  complete rewrite with better command handling.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Dec 27 02:14:49 UTC 2014 - seife+obs@b1-systems.com

- update to version 5.27
  Here comes the traditional x-mas release!
  BlueZ 5.27 consists mostly of bug fixes to areas such as GATT
  and mgmt (the interface through which bluetoothd talks to the
  kernel). The emulation framework has also received many new
  features, paving the way for more extensive test automation.

- update to version 5.26
  This release is for the most part a bug-fix release with fixes in
  A2DP and OBEX related functionality, but there’s also an added
  features for get/set reports for HID over GATT as well as
  Phonebook Access Profile 1.2 support
  The Bluetooth 4.2 specification went public in early December and
  BlueZ 5.26 is the first release with support for its features.
  Perhaps the most notable one of these is Low Energy Secure
  Connections which will require a 3.19 or newer kernel. This
  feature brings LE pairing to the same level of security as it has
  been for BR/EDR. LE SC also brings along with it so-called
  cross-transport pairing, which means that you only need to pair
  once over LE or BR/EDR to get the necessary keys for both
  transports between two dual-mode devices.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov 10 08:22:31 UTC 2014 - seife+obs@b1-systems.com

- update to version 5.25
  This release contains various improvements to MAP and PBAP
  support. There are also various GATT related fixes. We’ve also
  got a fix for a race condition which could occasionally cause LE
  connection/pairing failures. The fix will work for kernels from
  3.13 onward (for older kernels a proper fix isn’t really feasible).
- packaging: remove obsolete README.SUSE and README.packagers

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct  6 10:02:59 UTC 2014 - seife+obs@b1-systems.com

- update to version 5.24
  This release consists for the most part of cleanups and minor
  fixes, however there are some new additions too in the form of
  Phonebook Access Profile 1.2 and Message Access Profile 1.2
  features.
- packaging: mcaptest tool added to bluez-test package

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep  9 06:28:53 UTC 2014 - seife+obs@b1-systems.com

- update to version 5.23
  This is mostly a bug-fix release with fixes for concurrent
  authorization attempts (for untrusted devices), HID, uHID, OBEX,
  MAP and AVRCP. We now also have better support for AVCTP/AVRCP
  decoding with btmon.
  (no other packaging changes besides version bump)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug  8 06:43:18 UTC 2014 - seife+obs@b1-systems.com

- update to version 5.22
  This release contains several fixes to HID over GATT (HoG) as
  well as for AVRCP. Feature-wise there are a couple of notable
  additions debuting with the Linux kernel 3.17 release:
  * BR/EDR whitelist support. Starting with Linux kernel 3.17
    bluetoothd will no-longer set adapters to connectable by
    default. Instead, all configured remote devices are added to
    the kernel whitelist after which the kernel will enable page
    scanning but only accept connect requests from the whitelist.
    This effectively reduces the attack surface for unknown
    devices. When whitelist support is available the general
    connectable state now follows the discoverable state, meaning
    discoverable must be enabled for previously unknown devices to
    be able to connect to us.
  * Proper LE passive scanning support. For kernels before 3.17
    bluetoothd will use the Start/Stop Discovery commands to
    perform LE background scanning. This however uses LE active
    scanning which is both wasteful (causing unneeded Scan
    Requests) and can cause reconnection issues with devices using
    direct advertising (e.g. most LE mice). From kernel version
    3.17 onward bluetoothd will use proper kernel-side passive
    scanning, making the background scanning both efficient and
    more interoperable. The kernel will even use the
    controller-side whitelist during scanning (if no Resolvable
    Private Addresses are present), saving even more power.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jul  6 11:47:10 UTC 2014 - seife+obs@b1-systems.com

- update to version 5.21
  Bugfixes and improvements throughout the tree. Fixes to
  bluetoothctl to allow using it for scripting.
  An important detail of this release is that it supports several
  new features that are on their way to the 3.17 kernel. Perhaps
  the most important one of these is LE passive scanning. When
  run on a kernel that supports it, instead of doing a kind of
  "fake" background scanning using the Start Discovery command,
  bluetoothd will now tell the kernel the relevant information and
  the kernel will then commence passive scanning for devices.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jun 21 21:30:12 UTC 2014 - seife+obs@b1-systems.com

- update to version 5.20
  For non-Android related parts this is mostly a bug-fix release
  with minor fixes here and there as well as improved handling of
  PS3 controllers.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May 20 06:24:05 UTC 2014 - seife+obs@b1-systems.com

- update to version 5.19
  The release contains fixes to OBEX, AVRCP browsing, HID over GATT
  and handling of device unpaired events for dual-mode devices.
  There is also a fix to cleanly handle tools like bluetoothctl
  taking over the default agent role. Since there is no indication
  to the "normal" system default agent this would previously simply
  rob this property away without any way to know that this
  happened. From 5.19 onward bluetoothd maintains a stack of agents
  that have requested to be the default and will hand back the
  property to the next item in the stack when bluetoothctl (or some
  other tool) exits.
  Besides these fixes we’ve got some new additions too:
  * User space based HID host implementation (for BR/EDR), to
    complement the kernel-side implementation
  * A reconnect-upon-linkloss policy for those profiles that need,
    such as HFP HF or an A2DP Sink. The list of remote UUIDs to try
    to reconnect to is also configurable through main.conf.

- update to version 5.18
  "This is mostly a bug fix release with issues fixed regarding LE
   single mode device detection and incorrect getpeername() calls
   which could have caused incorrect SDP records for profiles
   (mainly those using the Profile D-Bus interface with RFCOMM
   channel auto-allocation).
   On the OBEX side we now have full OBEX authentication support,
   which is a fairly useless feature in practice but a mandatory
   one for qualification of some OBEX profiles."
