%description
Boost provides free peer-reviewed portable C++ source libraries. The
emphasis is on libraries that work well with the C++ Standard Library.
One goal is to establish "existing practice" and provide reference
implementations so that the Boost libraries are suitable for eventual
standardization. Some of the libraries have already been proposed for
inclusion in the C++ Standards Committee's upcoming C++ Standard
Library Technical Report.

Although Boost was begun by members of the C++ Standards Committee
Library Working Group, membership has expanded to include nearly two
thousand members of the C++ community at large.
