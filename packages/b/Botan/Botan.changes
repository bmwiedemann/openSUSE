Wed Nov 24 20:02:41 UTC 2021 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 2.18.2:
  * Avoid using short exponents when encrypting in ElGamal, as some PGP

Mon May 10 11:05:35 UTC 2021 - Andreas Stieger <andreas.stieger@gmx.de>

- Botan 2.18.1:
  * Fix a build regression in 2.18.0 which caused linker flags
    which contain -l within them (such as -fuse-linker-plugin)
    to be misinterpreted
  * Fix a bug which caused decoding a certificate which contained
    more than one name in a single RDN
  * Fix a bug which caused OID lookup failures when run in a locale
    which uses thousands separators (pt_BR was reported as having
    this issue)
  * DNS names in name constraints were compared with case
    sensitivity, which could cause valid certificates to be
    rejected
  * X.509 name constraint extensions were rejected if non-critical.
    RFC 5280 requires conforming CAs issue such extensions as
    critical, but not all certificates are compliant, and all other
    known implementations do not require this
  * X.509 name constraints were incorrectly applied to the
    certificate which included the constraint
- build with lzma compression support
- build with SQLite support
- build with TPM support
- fix SLE 12 build

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct 27 15:53:08 UTC 2020 - Pedro Monreal <pmonreal@suse.com>

- Update to 2.16.0:
  * Now userspace PRNG objects (such as AutoSeeded_RNG and HMAC_DRBG)
    use an internal lock, which allows safe concurrent use. This
    however is purely a precaution in case of accidental sharing of
    such RNG objects; for performance reasons it is always preferable
    to use a RNG per thread if a userspace RNG is needed.
  * DL_Group and EC_Group objects now track if they were created
    from a known trusted group (such as P-256 or an IPsec DH
    parameter). If so, then verification tests can be relaxed, as
    compared to parameters which may have been maliciously
    constructed in order to pass primality checks.
  * RandomNumberGenerator::add_entropy_T assumed its input was a POD
    type but did not verify this.
  * Support OCSP responders that live on a non-standard port.
  * Add support for Solaris sandbox.
  * Support suffixes on release numbers for alpha/beta releases.
  * Fix a bug in EAX which allowed requesting a 0 length tag, which
    had the effect of using a full length tag. Instead omit the
    length field, or request the full tag length explicitly.
  * Fix a memory leak in GCM where if passed an unsuitable block
    cipher (eg not 128 bit) it would throw an exception and leak
    the cipher object.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Aug 16 01:57:13 UTC 2020 - Dirk Mueller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 2.15:
  Fix a bug where the name constraint extension did not constrain the alternative
  DN field which can be included in a subject alternative name. This would allow
  a corrupted sub-CA which was otherwise constrained by a name constraint to
  issue a certificate with a prohibited DN.

  Fix a bug in the TLS server during client authentication where where if a
  (disabled by default) static RSA ciphersuite was selected, then no certificate
  request would be sent. This would have an equivalent effect to a client which
  simply replied with an empty Certificate message. (GH #2367)

  Replace the T-Tables implementation of AES with a 32-bit bitsliced version. As
  a result AES is now constant time on all processors. (GH #2346 #2348 #2353
  #2329 #2355)

  In TLS, enforce that the key usage given in the server certificate allows the
  operation being performed in the ciphersuite. (GH #2367)

  In X.509 certificates, verify that the algorithm parameters are the expected
  NULL or empty. (GH #2367)

  Change the HMAC key schedule to attempt to reduce the information leaked from
  the key schedule with regards to the length of the key, as this is at times (as
  for example in PBKDF2) sensitive information. (GH #2362)

  Add Processor_RNG which wraps RDRAND or the POWER DARN RNG instructions. The
  previous RDRAND_RNG interface is deprecated. (GH #2352)

  The documentation claimed that mlocked pages were created with a guard page
  both before and after. However only a trailing guard page was used. Add a
  leading guard page. (GH #2334)

  Add support for generating and verifying DER-encoded ECDSA signatures in the C
  and Python interfaces. (GH #2357 #2356)

  Workaround a bug in GCC’s UbSan which triggered on a code sequence in XMSS (GH
  #2322)

  When building documentation using Sphinx avoid parallel builds with version 3.0
  due to a bug in that version (GH #2326 #2324)

  Fix a memory leak in the CommonCrypto block cipher calls (GH #2371)

  Fix a flaky test that would occasionally fail when running the tests with a
  large number of threads. (GH #2325 #2197)

  Additional algorithms are now deprecated: XTEA, GOST, and Tiger. They will be
  removed in a future major release. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr  8 08:19:50 UTC 2020 - Paolo Stivanin <info@paolostivanin.com>

- Update to Botan 2.14:
  * Add support for using POWER8+ VPSUMD instruction to accelerate GCM (GH #2247)
  * Optimize the vector permute AES implementation, especially improving
    performance on ARMv7, Aarch64, and POWER. (GH #2243)
  * Use a new algorithm for modular inversions which is both faster
    and more resistant to side channel attacks. (GH #2287 #2296 #2301)
  * Address an issue in CBC padding which would leak the length of the plaintext
    which was being padded. Unpadding during decryption was not affected.
  * Optimize NIST prime field reductions, improving ECDSA by 3-9% (GH #2295)
  * Increase the size of the ECC blinding mask and scale it based on the
    size of the group order. (GH #880 #893 #2308)
  * Add server side support for the TLS asio wrapper. (GH #2229)
  * Add support for using Windows certificate store on MinGW (GH #2280)
  * Add a CLI utility cpu_clock which estimates the speed of the processor cycle counter.
  * Add Roughtime client (GH #2143 #1842)
  * Add support for XMSS X.509 certificates (GH #2172)
  * Add support for X.509 CRLs in FFI layer and Python wrapper (GH #2213)
  * Add AVX2 implementation of SHACAL2 (GH #2196)
  * Support more functionality for X.509 in the Python API (GH #2165)
  * Add generic CPU target useful when building for some new or unusual platform.
  * Disable MD5 in BSI or NIST modes (GH #2188)
  * Many currently public headers are being deprecated. If any such header is included by
    an application, a warning is issued at compile time.
    Headers issuing this warning will be made internal in a future major release.
  * RSA signature performance improvements (GH #2068 #2070)
  * Performance improvements for GCM (GH #2024 #2099 #2119), OCB (#2122), XTS (#2123) and
    ChaCha20Poly1305 (GH #2117), especially for small messages.
  * Add support for constant time AES using NEON and AltiVec (GH #2093 #2095 #2100)
  * Improve performance of POWER8 AES instructions (GH #2096)
  * Add support for the POWER9 hardware random number generator (GH #2026)
  * Add support for 64-bit version of RDRAND, doubling performance on x86-64 (GH #934 #2022)
  * In DTLS server, support a client crashing and then reconnecting from the same
    source port, as described in RFC 6347 sec 4.2.8 (GH #2029)
  * Optimize DTLS MTU splitting to split precisely to the set MTU (GH #2042)
  * Add support for the TLS v1.3 downgrade indicator. (GH #2027)
  * Add Argon2 PBKDF and password hash (GH #459 #1981 #1987)
  * Add Bcrypt-PBKDF (GH #1990)
  * Add server side support for issuing DTLS HelloVerifyRequest messages (GH #1999)
  * Add support for the TLS v1.3 supported_versions extension. (GH #1976)
  * Add Ed25519ph compatible with RFC 8032 (GH #1699 #2000)
  * Add support for OCSP stapling on server side. (GH #1703 #1967)
  * Add a boost::asio TLS stream compatible with boost::asio::ssl. (GH #1839 #1927 #1992)
  * Add a certificate store for Linux/Unix systems. (GH #1885 #1936)
  * Various Fixes

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr  2 12:54:40 UTC 2019 - Daniel Molkentin <daniel.molkentin@suse.com>

- Update to Botan 2.10

  * Bump SONAME

  * Warning: XMSS currently implements draft-06 which is not compatible with
    the final RFC 8391 specification. A PR is open to fix this, however it will
    break all current uses of XMSS. If you are currently using XMSS please
    comment at https://github.com/randombit/botan/pull/1858. Otherwise the PR
    will be merged and support for draft-06 will be removed starting in 2.11.

  * Added a new certificate store implementation that can access the MacOS
    keychain certificate store. (GH #1830)

  * Redesigned Memory_Pool class, which services allocations out of a set of
    pages locked into memory (using mlock/VirtualLock). It is now faster and
    with improved exploit mitigations. (GH #1800)

  * Add BMI2 implementations of SHA-512 and SHA-3 which improve performance by
    25-35% on common CPUs. (GH #1815)

  * Unroll SHA-3 computation improving performance by 10-12% (GH #1838)

  * Add a Thread_Pool class. It is now possible to run the tests in multiple
    threads with --test-threads=N flag to select the number of threads to use.
    Use --test-threads=0 to run with as many CPU cores as are available on the
    current system. The default remains single threaded. (GH #1819)

  * XMSS signatures now uses a global thread pool instead of spawning new
    threads for each usage. This improves signature generation performance by
    between 10% and 60% depending on architecture and core count. (GH #1864)

  * Some functions related to encoding and decoding BigInts have been
    deprecated. (GH #1817)

  * Binary encoding and decoding of BigInts has been optimized by performing
    word-size operations when possible. (GH #1817)

  * Rename the exception Integrity_Failure to Invalid_Authentication_Tag to
    make its meaning and usage more clear. The old name remains as a typedef.
    (GH #1816)

  * Support for using Boost filesystem and MSVC’s std::filesystem have been
    removed, since already POSIX and Win32 versions had to be maintained for
    portability. (GH #1814)

  * Newly generated McEliece and XMSS keys now default to being encrypted using
    SIV mode, support for which was added in 2.8.0. Previously GCM was used by
    default for these algorithms.

  * Use arc4random on Android systems (GH #1851)

  * Fix the encoding of PGP-S2K iteration counts (GH #1853 #1854)

  * Add a facility for sandboxing the command line util. Currently FreeBSD
    (Capsicum) and OpenBSD (pledge) sandboxes are supported. (GH #1808)

  * Use if constexpr when available.

  * Disable building shared libs on iOS as it was broken and it is not clear
    shared libraries are ever useful on iOS (GH #1865)

  * Renamed the darwin build target to macos. This should not cause any
    user-visible change. (GH #1866)

  * Add support for using sccache to cache the Windows CI build (GH #1807)

  * Add --extra-cxxflags option which allows adding compilation flags without
    overriding the default set. (GH #1826)

  * Add --format= option to the hash cli which allows formatting the output as
    base64 or base58, default output remains hex.

  * Add base58_enc and base58_dec cli utils for base58 encoding/decoding. (GH #1848)

  * Enable getentropy by default on macOS (GH #1862)

  * Avoid using -momit-leaf-frame-pointer flags, since -fomit-frame-pointer is
    already the default with recent versions of GCC.

  * Fix XLC sanitizer flags.

  * Rename Blake2b class to BLAKE2b to match the official name. There is a typedef for compat.

  * Fix a bug where loading a raw Ed25519_PublicKey of incorrect length would
    lead to a crash. (GH #1850)

  * Fix a bug that caused compilation problems using CryptoNG PRNG. (GH #1832)

  * Extended SHAKE-128 cipher to support any key between 1 and 160 bytes,
    instead of only multiples of 8 bytes.

  * Minor HMAC optimizations.

  * Build fixes for GNU/Hurd.

  * Fix a bug that prevented generating or verifying Ed25519 signatures in the
    CLI (GH #1828 #1829)

  * Fix a compilation error when building the amalgamation outside of the
    original source directory when AVX2 was enabled. (GH #1812)

  * Fix a crash when creating the amalgamation if a header file was edited on
    Windows but then the amalgamation was built on Linux (GH #1763)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 10 10:04:33 UTC 2019 - Daniel Molkentin <daniel.molkentin@suse.com>

- Update to Botan 2.9

  * Bump SONAME

  * CVE-2018-20187 Address a side channel during ECC key generation, which used an
    unblinded Montgomery ladder. As a result, a timing attack can reveal
    information about the high bits of the secret key.
    
  * Fix bugs in TLS which caused negotiation failures when the client used an
    unknown signature algorithm or version (GH #1711 #1709 #1708)
    
  * Fix bug affecting GCM, EAX and ChaCha20Poly1305 where if the associated data
    was set after starting a message, the new AD was not reflected in the produced
    tag. Now with these modes setting an AD after beginning a message throws an
    exception.
    
  * Use a smaller sieve which improves performance of prime generation.
    
  * Fixed a bug that caused ChaCha to produce incorrect output after encrypting 256
    GB. (GH #1728)
    
  * Add NEON and AltiVec implementations of ChaCha (GH #1719 #1728 #1729)
    
  * Optimize AVX2 ChaCha (GH #1730)
    
  * Many more operations in BigInt, ECC and RSA code paths are either fully const
    time or avoid problematic branches that could potentially be exploited in a
    side channel attack. (GH #1738 #1750 #1754 #1755 #1757 #1758 #1759 #1762 #1765
    #1770 #1773 #1774 #1779 #1780 #1794 #1795 #1796 #1797)
    
  * Several optimizations for BigInt and ECC, improving ECDSA performance by as
    much as 30%. (GH #1734 #1737 #1777 #1750 #1737 #1788)
    
  * Support recovering an ECDSA public key from a message/signature pair (GH #664
    #1784)
    
  * Add base58 encoding/decoding functions (GH #1783)
    
  * In the command line interface, add support for reading passphrases from the
    terminal with echo disabled (GH #1756)
    
  * Add CT::Mask type to simplify const-time programming (GH #1751)
    
  * Add new configure options --disable-bmi2, --disable-rdrand, and
    --disable-rdseed to prevent use of those instruction sets.
    
  * Add error_type and error_code functions to Exception type (GH #1744)
    
  * Now on POSIX systems posix_memalign is used instead of mmap for allocating the
    page-locked memory pool. This avoids issues with fork. (GH #602 #1798)
    
  * When available, use RDRAND to generate the additional data in
    Stateful_RNG::randomize_with_ts_input
    
  * Use vzeroall/vzeroupper intrinsics to avoid AVX2/SSE transition penalties.
    
  * Support for Visual C++ 2013 has been removed (GH #1557 #1697)
    
  * Resolve a memory leak when verifying ECDSA signatures with versions of OpenSSL
    before 1.1.0 (GH #1698)
    
  * Resolve a memory leak using ECDH via OpenSSL (GH #1767)
    
  * Fix an error in XTS which prohibited encrypting values which were exactly the
    same length as the underlying block size. Messages of this size are allowed by
    the standard and other XTS implementations. (GH #1706)
    
  * Resolve a bug in TSS which resulted in it using an incorrect length field in
    the shares. Now the correct length is encoded, but either correct or buggy
    lengths are accepted when decoding. (GH #1722)
    
  * Correct a bug when reducing a negative BigInt modulo a small power of 2. (GH
    #1755)
    
  * Add CLI utils for threshold secret splitting. (GH #1722)
    
  * Fix a bug introduced in 2.8.0 that caused compilation failure if using a single
    amalgamation file with AVX2 enabled. (GH #1700)
    
  * Add an explicit OS target for Emscripten and improve support for it. (GH #1702)
    
  * Fix small issues when building for QNX
    
  * Switch the Travis CI build to using Ubuntu 16.04 (GH #1767)
    
  * Add options to configure.py to disable generation of pkg-config file, and (for
    systems where pkg-config support defaults to off, like Windows), to enable
    generating it. (GH #1268)
    
  * Modify configure.py to accept empty lists or trailing/extra commas. (GH #1705)

- Update to Botan 2.8

  * Add support for using Apple CommonCrypto library for hashing (GH #1667),
    cipher modes (GH #1674) and block ciphers (GH #1673).

  * Support for negotiating TLS versions 1.0 and 1.1 is disabled in the default
    TLS policy. In addition, support for negotiating TLS ciphersuites using CBC
    or CCM mode is disabled by default. Applications which need to interop with
    old peers must enable these in their TLS policy object. (GH #1651)

  * During primality testing, use a Lucas test in addition to Miller-Rabin. It
    is possible to construct a composite integer which passes n Miller-Rabin
    tests with probability (1/4)^n. So for a incautious verifier using a small
    number of tests (under 16 or so) it is possible if unlikely they would
    accept such a composite as prime. Adding a Lucas test precludes such an
    attack. (GH #1636)

  * Add XChaCha and XChaCha20Poly1305 (GH #1640)

  * Add AVX2 implementations of ChaCha (GH #1662) and Serpent (GH #1660)

  * Add a new password hashing interface in pwdhash.h (GH #1670)

  * C binding improvements. Added functions to get name and supported
    keylengths of cipher, hash and MAC objects, support for FE1 format
    preserving encryption (GH #1625 #1646), functions to load and save RSA keys
    in PKCS #1 format (GH #1621), HOTP and TOTP algorithms, scrypt, certificate
    verification (GH #1647), functions to get the output length of public key
    operations (GH #1642), and functions for loading and serializing X25519
    keys (GH #1681)

  * Support for building with BOTAN_MP_WORD_BITS set to 8 or 16 has been removed.

  * Previously SM2 had two distinct key types, one for signatures and another
    for encryption. They have now been merged into a single key type since in
    practice it seems the same key is at times used for both operations. (GH
    #1637)

  * The Cipher_Mode class now derives from SymmetricAlgorithm (GH #1639)

  * Add support for using the ARMv8 instructions for SM4 encryption (GH #1622)

  * The entropy source using SecRandomCopyBytes has been removed as it was
    redundant with other entropy sources (GH #1668)

  * The Python module has much better error checking and reporting, and offers
    new functionality such as scrypt, MPI and FPE. (GH #1643 #1646)

  * Fixed a bug that caused CCM to fail with an exception when used with L=8 (GH #1631 #1632)

  * The default bcrypt work factor has been increased from 10 to 12.

  * The default algorithm used in passhash9 has changed from SHA-256 to
    SHA-512, and the default work factor increased from 10 to 15.

  * In ECC private keys, include the public key data for compatibility with GnuTLS (GH #1634 #1635)

  * Add support for using Linux getrandom syscall to access the system PRNG.
    This is disabled by default, use --with-os-feature=getrandom to enable.

  * It is now possible to encrypt private keys using SIV mode.

  * The FFI function botan_privkey_load now ignores its rng argument.

  * Resolve a problem when building under Visual C++ 15.8 (GH #1624)

  * Fix a bug in XSalsa20 (192-bit Salsa nonces) where if set_iv was called
    twice without calling set_key, the resulting encryption was incorrect. (GH
    #1640)

  * Handle an error seen when verifying invalid ECDSA signatures using LibreSSL
    on non x86-64 platforms (GH #1627 #1628)

  * Fix bugs in PKCS7 and X9.23 CBC padding schemes, which would ignore the
    first byte in the event the padding took up the entire block. (GH #1690)

  * Correct bugs which would cause CFB, OCB, and GCM modes to crash when they
    were used in an unkeyed state. (GH #1639)

  * Optimizations for SM4 and Poly1305

  * Avoid a cache side channel in the AES key schedule

  * Add pk_encrypt and pk_decrypt CLI operations

  * Now asn1print CLI defaults to printing context-specific fields.

  * Use codec_base for Base64, which matches how Base32 is implemented (GH #1597)

  * The cast module has been split up into cast128 and cast256 (GH #1685)

  * When building under Visual C++ 2013, the user must acknowledge the upcoming
    removal of support using the configure.py flag --ack-vc2013-deprecated (GH
    #1557)

  * Add 24 word wide Comba multiplication, improving 3072-bit RSA and DH by
    ~25%. (GH #1564)

  * Unroll Montgomery reduction for specific sizes (GH #1603)

  * Improved performance of signature verification in ECGDSA, ECKCDSA, SM2 and
    GOST by 10-15%.

  * XMSS optimizations (GH #1583 #1585)

  * Fix an error that meant XMSS would only sign half as many signatures as is
    allowed (GH #1582)

  * Add support for base32 encoding/decoding (GH #1541)

  * Add BMI2 optimized version of SHA-256, 40% faster on Skylake (GH #1584)

  * Allow the year to be up to 2200 in ASN.1 time objects. Previously this was
    limited to 2100. (GH #1536)

  * Add support for Scrypt password hashing (GH #1570)

  * Add support for using Scrypt for private key encryption (GH #1574)

  * Optimizations for DES/3DES, approx 50% faster when used in certain modes
    such as CBC decrypt or CTR.

  * XMSS signature verification did not check that the signature was of the
    expected length which could lead to a crash. (GH #1537)

  * The bcrypt variants 2b and 2y are now supported.

  * Support for 192-bit Suite B TLS profile is now implemented, as the 128-bit
    Suite B is since 2015 not allowed anymore.

  * Previously botan allowed GCM to be used with an empty nonce, which is not
    allowed by the specification. Now such nonces are rejected.

  * Avoid problems on Windows when compiling in Unicode mode (GH #1615 #1616)

  * Previously for ASN.1 encoded signatures (eg ECDSA) Botan would accept any
    valid BER encoding. Now only the single valid DER encoding is accepted.

  * Correct an error that could in rare cases cause an internal error exception
    when doing computations with the P-224 curve.

  * Optimizations to reduce allocations/copies during DER encoding and BER
    decoding (GH #1571 #1572 #1600)

  * Botan generates X.509 subject key IDs by hashing the public key with
    whatever hash function is being used to sign the certificate. However
    especially for SHA-512 this caused SKIDs that were far longer than
    necessary. Now all SKIDs are truncated to 192 bits.

  * In the test suite use mkstemp to create temporary files instead of creating
    them in the current working directory. (GH #1533 #1530)

  * It is now possible to safely override CXX when invoking make in addition to
    when configure.py is run. (GH #1579)

  * OIDs for Camellia and SM4 in CBC and GCM mode are now defined, making it
    possible to use this algorithms for private key encryption.

  * Avoid creating symlinks to the shared object on OpenBSD (#1535)

  * The factor command runs much faster on larger inputs now.

  * Support for Windows Phone/UWP was deprecated starting in 2.5. This
    deprecation has been reversed as it seems UWP is still actively used. (GH
    #1586 #1587)

  * Support for Visual C++ 2013 is deprecated, and will be removed in Jan 2019.

  * Added support for GCC’s –sysroot option to configure.py for
    cross-compiling.

Thu Apr 12 16:06:00 UTC 2018 - kasimir_@outlook.de

- fixed to build on armv6 and armv7

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr 10 15:07:00 UTC 2018 - daniel.molkentin@suse.com

- Update to Botan 2.6

  * CVE-2018-9860 Fix a bug decrypting TLS CBC ciphertexts which could for a
    malformed ciphertext cause the decryptor to read and HMAC an additional 64K
    bytes of data which is not part of the record. This could cause a crash if
    the read went into unmapped memory. No information leak or out of bounds
    write occurs.

  * Add support for OAEP labels (GH #1508)

  * RSA signing is about 15% faster (GH #1523) and RSA verification is about 50% faster.

  * Add exponent blinding to RSA (GH #1523)

  * Add Cipher_Mode::create and AEAD_Mode::create (GH #1527)

  * Fix bug in TLS server introduced in 2.5 which caused connection to fail if
    the client offered any signature algorithm not known to the server (for
    example RSA/SHA-224).

  * Fix a bug in inline asm that would with GCC 7.3 cause incorrect
    computations and an infinite loop during the tests. (GH #1524 #1529)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr  3 08:06:46 UTC 2018 - daniel.molkentin@suse.com

- Update to Botan 2.5

  * Fix error in certificate wildcard matching (CVE-2018-9127), where a
    wildcard cert for b*.example.com would be accepted as a match for any host
    with name *b*.example.com (GH #1519)

  * Add support for RSA-PSS signatures in TLS (GH #1285)

  * Ed25519 certificates are now supported (GH #1501)

  * Many optimizations in ECC operations. ECDSA signatures are 8-10 times
    faster. ECDSA verification is about twice as fast. ECDH key agreement is
    3-4 times faster. (GH #1457 #1478)

  * Implement product scanning Montgomery reduction, which improves
    Diffie-Hellman and RSA performance by 10 to 20% on most platforms. (GH
    #1472)

  * DSA signing and verification performance has improved by 30-50%.

  * Add a new Credentials_Manager callback that specifies which CAs the server
    has indicated it trusts (GH #1395 fixing #1261)

  * Add new TLS::Callbacks methods that allow creating or removing extensions,
    as well as examining extensions sent by the peer (GH #1394 #1186)

  * Add new TLS::Callbacks methods that allow an application to negotiate use
    of custom elliptic curves. (GH #1448)

  * Add ability to create custom elliptic curves (GH #1441 #1444)

  * Add support for POWER8 AES instructions (GH #1459 #1393 #1206)

  * Fix DSA/ECDSA handling of hashes longer than the group order (GH #1502
    #986)

  * The default encoding of ECC public keys has changed from compressed to
    uncompressed point representation. This improves compatability with some
    common software packages including Golang’s standard library. (GH #1480
    #1483)

  * It is now possible to create DNs with custom components. (GH #1490 #1492)

  * It is now possible to specify the serial number of created certificates,
    instead of using the default 128-bit random integer. (GH #1489 #1491)

  * Change DL_Group and EC_Group to store their data as shared_ptr for fast
    copying. Also both classes precompute additional useful values (eg for
    modular reductions). (GH #1435 #1454)

  * Make it possible for PKCS10 requests to include custom extensions. This
    also makes it possible to use muliple SubjectAlternativeNames of a single
    type in a request, which was previously not possible. (GH #1429 #1428)

  * Add new optimized interface for FE1 format preserving encryption. By
    caching a number of values computed in the course of the FPE calculation,
    it provides a 6-7x speedup versus the old API. (GH #1469)

  * Add DSA and ElGamal keygen functions to FFI (#1426)

  * Add Pipe::prepend_filter to replace Pipe::prepend (GH #1402)

  * Fix a memory leak in the OpenSSL block cipher integration, introduced in
  * 2.2.0

  * Use an improved algorithm for generating safe primes which is several tens
    of times faster. Also, fix a bug in the prime sieving algorithm which
    caused standard prime generation (like for RSA keys) to be slower than
    necessary. (GH #1413 #1411)

  * Correct the return value of PK_Encryptor::maximum_input_size which reported
    a much too small value (GH #1410)

  * Remove use of CPU specific optimization flags, instead the user should set
    these via CXXFLAGS if desired. (GH #1392)

  * Resolve an issue that would cause a crash in the tests if they were run on
    a machine without SSE2/NEON/VMX instructions. (GH #1495)

  * The Python module now tries to load DLLs from a list of names and uses the
    first one which successfully loads and indicates it supports the desired
    API level. (GH #1497)

  * Various minor optimizations for SHA-3 (GH #1433 #1434)

  * The output of botan --help has been improved (GH #1387)

  * Add --der-format flag to command line utils, making it possible verify
    DSA/ECDSA signatures generated by OpenSSL command line (GH #1409)

  * Add support for --library-suffix option to configure.py (GH #1405 #1404)

  * Use feature flags to enable/disable system specific code (GH #1378)

  * Add --msvc-runtime option to allow using static runtime (GH #1499 #210)

  * Add –enable-sanitizers= option to allow specifying which sanitizers to
    enable. The existing --with-sanitizers option just enables some default set
    which is known to work with the minimum required compiler versions.

  * Use either rst2man or rst2man.py for generating man page as distributions
    differ on where this program is installed (GH #1516)

  * The threefish module has been renamed threefish_512 since that is the
    algorithm it provides. (GH #1477)

  * The Perl XS based wrapper has been removed, as it was unmaintained and
    broken. (GH #1412)

  * The sqlite3 encryption patch under contrib has been removed. It is still
    maintained by the original author at
    https://github.com/OlivierJG/botansqlite3

  Changes and new features:

  * Several build improvements requested by downstream packagers,
    including the ability to disable building the static library. All
    makefile constructs that were specific to nmake or GNU make have
    been eliminated, thus the option ``--makefile-style`` which was
    previously used to select the makefile type has also been
    removed. (GH #1230 #1237 #1300 #1318 #1319 #1324 #1325 #1346)

  * Support for negotiating the DH group as specified in RFC 7919 is
    now available in TLS (GH #1263)

  * Support for ARIA-GCM ciphersuites are now available in TLS. They
    are disabled by default. (GH #1284)

  * Add support for generating and verifying X.509 objects
    (certificates, CRLs, etc) using RSA-PSS signatures (GH #1270 and
    #1368)

  * Add support for AES key wrapping with padding, as specified in RFC
    5649 and NIST SP 800-38F (GH #1301)

  * OCSP requests made during certificate verification had the
    potential to hang forever. Now the sockets are non-blocking and a
    timeout is enforced. (GH #1360 fixing GH #1326)

  * Add ``Public_Key::fingerprint_public`` which allows fingerprinting
    the public key.
    The previously available ``Private_Key::fingerprint`` is
    deprecated, now ``Private_Key::fingerprint_private`` should be
    used if this is required.  (GH #1357)

  * ECC certificates generated by Botan used an invalid encoding for
    the parameters field, which was rejected by some certificate
    validation libraries notably BouncyCastle. (GH #1367)

  * Loading an ECC key which used OID encoding for the domain
    parameters, then saving it, would result in a key using the
    explicit parameters encoding.  Now the OID encoding is
    retained. (GH #1365)

  * Correct various problems in certificate path validation that arose
    when multiple paths could be constructed leading to a trusted root
    but due to other constraints only some of them validated. (GH
    #1363)

  * It is now possible for certificate validation to return warning
    indicators, such as that the distinguished name is not within
    allowed limits or that a certificate with a negative serial number
    was observed. (GH #1363 #1359)

  * XMSS signatures now are multi-threaded for improved performance
    (GH #1267)

  * Fix a bug that caused the TLS peer cert list to be empty on a
    resumed session.  (GH #1303 #1342)

  * Increase the maximum HMAC key length from 512 bytes to 4096
    bytes. This allows using a DH key exchange in TLS with a group
    greater than 4096 bits. (GH #1316)

  * Fix a bug in the TLS server where, on receiving an SSLv3 client
    hello, it would attempt to negotiate TLS v1.2. Now a
    protocol_version alert is sent.  Found with tlsfuzzer. (GH #1316)

  * Fix several bugs related to sending the wrong TLS alert type in
    various error scenarios, caught with tlsfuzzer.

  * Add support for a ``tls_http_server`` command line utility which
    responds to simple GET requests. This is useful for testing
    against a browser, or various TLS test tools which expect the
    underlying protocol to be HTTP. (GH #1315)

  * Add an interface for generic PSK data stores, as well as an
    implementation which encrypts stored values with AES key
    wrapping. (GH #1302)

  * Optimize GCM mode on systems both with and without carryless
    multiply support. This includes a new base case implementation
    (still constant time), a new SSSE3 implementation for systems with
    SSSE3 but not clmul, and better algorithms for systems with clmul
    and pmull. (GH #1253 #1263)

  * Various optimizations for OCB, CFB, CTR, SM3, SM4, GMAC, BLAKE2b,
    Blowfish, Twofish, CAST-128, and CRC24 (GH #1281)

  * Salsa20 now supports the seek operation.

  * Add ``EC_Group::known_named_groups`` (GH #1339)

  * Symmetric algorithms (block ciphers, stream ciphers, MACs) now
    verify that a key was set before accepting data. Previously
    attempting to use an unkeyed object would instead result in either
    a crash or invalid outputs. (GH #1279)

  * The X509 certificate, CRL and PKCS10 types have been heavily
    refactored internally. Previously all data of these types was
    serialized to strings, then in the event a more complicated data
    structure (such as X509_DN) was needed, it would be recreated from
    the string representation. However the round trip process was not
    perfect and could cause fields to become lost. This approach is no
    longer used, fixing several bugs (GH #1010 #1089 #1242 #1252). The
    internal data is now stored in a ``shared_ptr``, so copying such
    objects is now very cheap. (GH #884)

  * ASN.1 string objects previously held their contents as ISO 8859-1
    codepoints.  However this led to certificates which contained
    strings outside of this character set (eg in Cyrillic, Greek, or
    Chinese) being rejected. Now the strings are always converted to
    UTF-8, which allows representing any character. In addition, UCS-4
    strings are now supported.  (GH #1113 #1250 #1287 #1289)

  * It is now possible to create an uninitialized X509_Certificate
    object. Such an object will throw if any attempt to access its
    members is made. (GH #1335)

  * In BER decoder, avoid unbounded stack recursion when parsing
    nested indefinite length values. Now at most 16 nested indefinite
    length values are accepted, anything deeper resulting in a
    decoding error.  (GH #1304 OSS-Fuzz 4353).

  * A new ASN.1 printer API allows generating a string representation
    of arbitrary BER data. This is used in the ``asn1print`` command
    line utility and may be useful in other applications, for instance
    for debugging.

  * New functions for bit rotations that distinguish rotating by a
    compile-time constant vs a runtime variable rotation. This allows
    better optimizations in both cases. Notably performance of
    CAST-128 and CAST-256 are substantially improved. (GH #1247)

  * TLS CBC ciphersuites now are implemented using the standard CBC
    code, instead of reimplementing CBC inside the TLS stack. This
    allows for parallel decryption of TLS CBC ciphertexts, and
    improves performance especially when using AES hardware
    support. (GH #1269)

  * Add callbacks to make it possible for an application using TLS to
    provide custom implementations of signature schemes, eg when
    offloading the computations to another device. (GH #1332)

  * Use a direct calculation for calendar computations instead of
    relying on non-portable operating system interfaces. (GH #1336)

  * Fix a bug in the amalgamation generation which could cause build
    failures on some systems including macOS. (GH #1264 #1265)

  * A particular code sequence in TLS handshake would always (with an
    ECC ciphersuite) result in an exception being thrown and then
    caught.  This has changed so no exception is thrown. (GH #1275)

  * The code for byteswapping has been improved for ARMv7 and for
    Windows x86-64 systems using MSVC. (GH #1274)

  * The GMAC class no longer derives from GHASH. This should not cause
    any noticeable change for applications. (GH #1253)

  * The base implementation of AES now uses a single 4K table, instead
    of 4 such tables. This offers a significant improvement against
    cache-based side channels without hurting performance too much. In
    addition the table is now guaranteed to be aligned on a cache
    line, which ensures the additional countermeasure of reading each
    cache line works as expected. (GH #1255)

  * In TLS client resumption, avoid sending a OCSP stapling
    request. This caused resumption failures with some servers. (GH
    #1276)

  * The overhead of making a call through the FFI layer has been
    reduced.

  * The IDs for SHA-3 PKCSv1.5 signatures added in 2.3.0 were
    incorrect. They have been changed to use the correct encoding, and
    a test added to ensure such errors do not recur.

  * Counter mode allows setting a configurable width of the
    counter. Previously it was allowed for a counter of even 8 bits
    wide, which would mean the keystream would repeat after just 256
    blocks. Now it requires the width be at least 32 bits. The only
    way this feature could be used was by manually constructing a
    ``CTR_BE`` object and setting the second parameter to something in
    the range of 1 to 3.

  * A new mechanism for formatting ASN.1 data is included in
    ``asn1_print.h``.  This is the same functionality used by the
    command line ``asn1print`` util, now cleaned up and moved to the
    library.

  * Add ``Pipe::append_filter``. This is like the existing
    (deprecated) ``Pipe::append``, the difference being that
    ``append_filter`` only allows modification before the first call
    to ``start_msg``. (GH #1306 #1307)

  * The size of ASN1_Tag is increased to 32 bits. This avoids a
    problem with UbSan (GH #751)

  * Fix a bug affecting bzip2 compression. In certain circumstances,
    compression would fail with ``BZ_SEQUENCE_ERROR`` due to calling
    bzlib in an way it does not support. (GH #1308 #1309)

  * In 2.3.0, final annotations were added to many classes including
    the TLS policies (like ``Strict_Policy`` and
    ``BSI_TR_02102_2``). However it is reasonable and useful for an
    application to derive from one of these policies, so as to create
    an application specific policy that is based on a library-provided
    policy, but with a few tweaks. So the final annotations have been
    removed on these classes. (GH #1292)

  * A new option ``--with-pdf`` enables building a PDF copy of the
    handbook.  (GH #1337)

  * A new option ``--with-rst2man`` enables building a man page for
    the command line util using Docutils rst2man. (GH #1349)

  * Support for NEON is now enabled under Clang.

  * Now the compiler version is detected using the preprocessor,
    instead of trying to parse the output of the compiler's version
    string, which was subject to problems with localization. (GH
    #1358)

  * By default the gzip compressor will not include a timestamp in the
    header.  The timestamp can be set by passing it to the
    ``Gzip_Compression`` constructor.

  * Add an OID for RIPEMD-160

  * Fixes for CMake build (GH #1251)

  * Avoid some signed overflow warnings (GH #1220 #1245)

  * As upstream support for Native Client has been deprecated by
    Google, support is now also deprecated in Botan and will be
    removed in a future release.

  * The Perl-XS wrapper has not been maintained in many years. It is
    now deprecated, and if no attempts are made to revive it, it will
    be removed in a future release.

  * Support for building on IRIX has been removed.

Wed Oct  4 07:49:54 UTC 2017 - daniel.molkentin@suse.com

- Update to 1.10.17
  - Address a side channel affecting modular exponentiation. An attacker
    capable of a local or cross-VM cache analysis attack may be able to recover
    bits of secret exponents as used in RSA, DH, etc. CVE-2017-14737 Workaround
    a miscompilation bug in GCC 7 on x86-32 affecting GOST-34.11 hash function.
    (GH #1192 #1148 #882, bsc#1060433)
  - Add SecureVector::data() function which returns the start of the buffer.
    This makes it slightly simpler to support both 1.10 and 2.x APIs in the
    same codebase.  When compiled by a C++11 (or later) compiler, a template
    typedef of SecureVector, secure_vector, is added. In 2.x this class is a
    std::vector with a custom allocator, so has a somewhat different interface
    than SecureVector in 1.10. But this makes it slightly simpler to support
    both 1.10 and 2.x APIs in the same codebase.
  - Fix a bug that prevented configure.py from running under Python3
  - Botan 1.10.x does not support the OpenSSL 1.1 API. Now the build will
    #error if OpenSSL 1.1 is detected. Avoid –with-openssl if compiling against
    1.1 or later. (GH #753)
  - Import patches from Debian adding basic support for
    building on aarch64, ppc64le, or1k, and mipsn32 platforms.

  * obsoletes CVE-2017-14737.patch

  * refreshes aarch64-support.patch

  * drop ppc64le-support.patch for upstream version
    (disables altivec support as per concerns by upstream)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep 26 13:03:46 UTC 2017 - daniel.molkentin@suse.com

- Update to 1.10.16 (Fixes CVE-2017-2801, bsc#1033605)
    * Fix a bug in X509 DN string comparisons that could result in out of bound
      reads. This could result in information leakage, denial of service, or
      potentially incorrect certificate validation results. (CVE-2017-2801)
    * Avoid use of C++11 std::to_string in some code added in 1.10.14 (GH #747 #834)
- Changes from 1.10.15:
    * Change an unintended behavior of 2.0.0, which named the include directory
      botan-2.0. Since future release of Botan-2 should be compatible with code
      written against old versions, there does not seem to be any reason to
    * version the include directory with the minor number. (GH #830 #833)
    * Fix a bug which caused an error when building on Cygwin or other platforms
      where shared libraries are not supported. (GH #821)
    * Enable use of readdir on Cygwin, which allows the tests to run (GH #824)
    * Switch to readthedocs Sphinx theme by default (GH #822 #823)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec 28 12:02:11 CET 2016 - pth@suse.de

- Update to 1.10.14
    * Fix integer overflow during BER decoding, found by Falko Strenzke.
      This bug is not thought to be directly exploitable but upgrading ASAP
      is advised. (CVE-2016-9132)
    * Fix two cases where (in error situations) an exception would be
      thrown from a destructor, causing a call to std::terminate.
    * When RC4 is disabled in the build, also prevent it from being
      included in the OpenSSL provider. (GH #638)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Nov 13 01:32:18 UTC 2016 - netsroth@opensuse.org

- Update to 1.10.13
  * Use constant time modular inverse algorithm to avoid possible side 
    channel attack against ECDSA (CVE-2016-2849)
  * Use constant time PKCS #1 unpadding to avoid possible side channel
    attack against RSA decryption (CVE-2015-7827)
  * Avoid a compilation problem in OpenSSL engine when ECDSA was
    disabled. Gentoo bug 542010

- Update to 1.10.12

- Version 1.10.12, 2016-02-03
  * In 1.10.11, the check in PointGFp intended to check the affine y 
    argument actually checked the affine x again. Reported by Remi Gacogne
  * The CVE-2016-2195 overflow is not exploitable in 1.10.11 due to an 
    additional check in the multiplication function itself which was also 
    added in that release, so there are no security implications from the 
    missed check. However to avoid confusion the change was pushed in a new 
    release immediately.
  * The 1.10.11 release notes incorrectly identified CVE-2016-2195 as 
    CVE-2016-2915
- Version 1.10.11, 2016-02-01
  * Resolve heap overflow in ECC point decoding. CVE-2016-2195
    Resolve infinite loop in modular square root algorithm. CVE-2016-2194

Tue Aug 11 22:49:31 UTC 2015 - netsroth@opensuse.org

- bump SONAME to libbotan-1_10-1
- Update to 1.10.10
  * SECURITY: The BER decoder would crash due to reading from offset 0
    of an empty vector if it encountered a BIT STRING which did not
    contain any data at all. As the type requires a 1 byte field this
    is not valid BER but could occur in malformed data. Found with
    afl. CVE-2015-5726
  * SECURITY: The BER decoder would allocate a fairly arbitrary amount
    of memory in a length field, even if there was no chance the read
    request would succeed. This might cause the process to run out of
    memory or invoke the OOM killer. Found with afl. CVE-2015-5727
  * Due to an ABI incompatible (though not API incompatible) change in
    this release, the version number of the shared object has been
    increased.
  * The default TLS policy no longer allows RC4.
  * Fix a signed integer overflow in Blue Midnight Wish that may cause
    incorrect computations or undefined behavior.

- Update to 1.10.9
  * Fixed EAX tag verification to run in constant time
  * The default TLS policy now disables SSLv3.
  * A crash could occur when reading from a blocking random device if
    the device initially indicated that entropy was available but a
    concurrent process drained the entropy pool before the read was
    initiated.
  * Fix decoding indefinite length BER constructs that contain a
    context sensitive tag of zero. Github pull 26 from Janusz Chorko.
  * The botan-config script previously tried to guess its prefix from
    the location of the binary. However this was error prone, and now
    the script assumes the final installation prefix matches the value
    set during the build. Github issue 29.

- Change build dependence "libqt4-devel" to "libqt5-qtbase-devel".

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May  8 18:00:00 CET 2014 - tbehrens@suse.com

- Update to 1.10.8
  * Fix a bug in primality testing introduced in 1.8.3 which caused
    only a single random base, rather than a sequence of random bases,
    to be used in the Miller-Rabin test. This increased the
    probability that a non-prime would be accepted, for instance a
    1024 bit number would be incorrectly classed as prime with
    probability around 2^-40. Reported by Jeff Marrison.
  * The key length limit on HMAC has been raised to 512 bytes,
    allowing the use of very long passphrases with PBKDF2.

- Update to 1.10.7
  * OAEP had two bugs, one of which allowed it to be used even if the
    key was too small, and the other of which would cause a crash
    during decryption if the EME data was too large for the associated
    key.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov 11 20:11:43 UTC 2013 - tbehrens@suse.com

- Update to 1.10.6
  * The device reading entropy source now attempts to read from all
    available devices. Previously it would break out early if a
    partial read from a blocking source occured, not continuing to
    read from a non-blocking device. This would cause the library to
    fall back on slower and less reliable techniques for collecting
    PRNG seed material. Reported by Rickard Bellgrim.
  * HMAC_RNG (the default PRNG implementation) now automatically
    reseeds itself periodically. Previously reseeds only occured on
    explicit application request.
  * Fix an encoding error in EC_Group when encoding using
    EC_DOMPAR_ENC_OID. Reported by fxdupont on github.
  * In EMSA2 and Randpool, avoid calling name() on objects after
    deleting them if the provided algorithm objects are not suitable
    for use. Found by Clang analyzer, reported by Jeffrey Walton.
  * If X509_Store was copied, the u32bit containing how long to cache
    validation results was not initialized, potentially causing
    results to be cached for significant amounts of time. This could
    allow a certificate to be considered valid after its issuing CA’s
    cert expired. Expiration of the end-entity cert is always checked,
    and reading a CRL always causes the status to be reset, so this
    issue does not affect revocation. Found by Coverity scanner.
  * Avoid off by one causing a potentially unterminated string to be
    passed to the connect system call if the library was configured to
    use a very long path name for the EGD socket. Found by Coverity
    Scanner.
  * In PK_Encryptor_EME, PK_Decryptor_EME, PK_Verifier, and
    PK_Key_Agreement, avoid dereferencing an unitialized pointer if no
    engine supported operations on the key object given. Found by
    Coverity scanner.
  * Avoid leaking a file descriptor in the /dev/random and EGD entropy
    sources if stdin (file descriptor 0) was closed. Found by Coverity
    scanner.
  * Avoid a potentially undefined operation in the bit rotation
    operations. Not known to have caused problems under any existing
    compiler, but might have caused problems in the future. Caught by
    Clang sanitizer, reported by Jeffrey Walton.
  * Increase default hash iterations from 10000 to 50000 in PBES1 and
    PBES2
  * Add a fix for mips64el builds from Brad Smith.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Mar 16 13:44:43 UTC 2013 - cgiboudeaux@gmx.com

- Update to 1.10.5
  * A potential crash in the AES-NI implementation of the AES-192 key schedule
    (caused by misaligned loads) has been fixed.
  * A previously conditional operation in Montgomery multiplication and
    squaring is now always performed, removing a possible timing channel.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- aarch64-support.patch: add support for aarch64

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep 14 20:08:15 UTC 2012 - p.drouand@gmail.com

- update to 1.10.3:
  * A change in 1.10.2 accidentally broke ABI compatibility with 
    1.10.1 and earlier versions, causing programs compiled against 
    1.10.1 to crash if linked with 1.10.2 at runtime.
  * Recent versions of OpenSSL include extra information in ECC 
    private keys, the presence of which caused an exception when such 
    a key was loaded by botan. The decoding of ECC private keys has been 
    changed to ignore these fields if they are set.

  package allows to build only one -devel package

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun 22 16:10:32 CEST 2011 - pth@suse.de

- Fix Requires for devel package.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun 21 16:53:15 CEST 2011 - pth@suse.de

- Devel package now is versioned so multiple devel packages may
  be installed in parallel.
- Devel package renamed back to Botan-devel to keep rpmlint from
  thinking it is a library package ...

- Update to 1.10.0:
  New Features:
  * SSL (SSLv3, TLS 1.0, and TLS 1.1 are currently supported)
  * GOST 34.10-2001 signature scheme (a Russian ECC signature standard
    analogous to ECDSA)
  * The SHA-3 candidates Keccak and Blue Midnight Wish
  * Bcrypt password hashing
  * XSalsa20
  * AES key wrapping
  * Comb4P hash combinator.

  Other Changes:
  * The block cipher interface now exposes any possible parallelism
    available to the implementation, and XTS, CTR, and CBC modes have been
    changed to use them.

  * SIMD implementations of Serpent, XTEA, Noekeon, and IDEA have been
    added, as has an implementation of AES using SSSE3 which runs both in
    constant time and, on recent processors, significantly faster than the
    usual table based implementation.  There have also been numerous
    optimizations to elliptic curves.

  * The documentation, previously written in LaTeX, is now in
    reStructuredText, which is converted into HTML with Sphinx.  This new
    format is significantly easier to write, encouraging more documentation
    to be written and updated.  And, indeed, a number of features never
    before documented are now described in the manual.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep  1 16:38:40 CEST 2010 - pth@suse.de

- Prefix last patch with Botan-.
- Enable building of the qt_mutex module. This means that from now
  on libbotan requires libQtCore.
- Fix test for thread/mutex support to also work for Qt4.

- Update to 1.8.10:

  * This release changes a number of aspects of how private keys are
    encrypted. The default encryption algorithm has changed from 3DES
    to AES-256

  * The default iteration count for PBES1 and PBES2 encryption schemes
    (which are used primarily to encrypt asymmetric keys like RSA or
    DSA) has increased from 2048 to 10000, which should make brute
    force key cracking substantially harder.

  * The first round of AES now uses a smaller set of lookup tables;
    this only reduces performance slightly but some timing and cache
    analysis attacks against AES are substantially harder when AES is
    implemented this way.

  * The class known as S2K was renamed PBKDF in 1.9, with a typedef
    for backwards compatibility. For providing an equivalent forward
    compatibility path, 1.8.10 includes a typedef for PBKDF and a new
    accessor function get_pbkdf. It also includes a new interface for
    deriving keys with a passphrase which takes both the passphrase
    and desired output length as well as the salt and iteration
    count; in many cases this call is actually significantly more
    convenient than the older API.
