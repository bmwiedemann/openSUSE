  <title>Udev helper for naming devices per BIOS names</title>
  <description>biosdevname in its simplest form takes an kernel name name as an
argument, and returns the BIOS-given name it &quot;should&quot; be.  This is
necessary on systems where the BIOS name for a given device (e.g. the
label on the chassis is &quot;Gb1&quot;) doesn't map directly and obviously to
the kernel name (e.g. eth0).</description>
