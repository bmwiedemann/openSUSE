- Update to 2.1.0
  * No functional changes.
  * The underlying code that discovers default route interface
    address had to be re-implemented due to the old code having
	stopped working though having not changed in 6 years: rtnetlink
	changed, apparently.
  * New method is to read /proc/net/route to get default route
    directly, used to feed getifaddrs(3) comparison as before.
