  <title>BibleSync</title>
  <description>BibleSync is a multicast protocol to support Bible software shared conavigation. It uses LAN multicast in either a personal/small team mutual navigation motif or in a classroom environment where there are Speakers plus the Audience. It provides a complete yet minimal public interface to support mode setting, setup for packet reception, transmit on local navigation, and handling of incoming packets.

This library is not specific to any particular Bible software framework, completely agnostic as to structure of layers above BibleSync.</description>
