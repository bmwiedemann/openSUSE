- Update to version 0.5.3 (changes since 0.5.1):
  * BamfView: Reload the view children everytime it changes dbus
    path. Without doing it we could have children-less views in
    case we have just re-matched a view with a different dbus path
    (this happens in general for desktop-less applications), because
    the proxy won't be fast enough to catch the signal to update
    the inner children list (lp#1238064).
  * BamfXutils: Trap the X errors when doing async X calls
    (lp#1193714).
  * bamf-legacy-window-test.c: Don't use 'return' with a value, in
    function returning void.
  * Fix return value of try_create_local_desktop_data (lp#1280110).
  * BamfLegacyScreen: When in Unity monitor for compiz
    ClientMessage's to show action menu If we get a
    _COMPIZ_TOOLKIT_ACTION client message with the internal value
    _COMPIZ_TOOLKIT_ACTION_WINDOW_MENU, then we are requested by
    compiz to show the window action menu, and thus let's ask the
    proper BamfLegacyWindow to do that, thanks to libwnck
    (lp#1280042).
  * Remove old webapp related code since now we don't use browser
    tab matching anymore (lp#1289498).
  * Rip out vestigial webapps code (lp#1280337, lp#1280337).
  * BamfMatcher: Fix prefix regex for pythonX support (used for
    converting /usr/bin/python[stuff] foo into foo) to work with
    pythonX as well as python and pythonX.Y.
  * BamfLegacyScreen: Do not show the actions menu for desktop type
    window (lp#1342609).
  * Replace gtk_icon_theme_has_icon with gtk_icon_theme_lookup_icon
    (lp#1407192).
  * Matcher: Honour the _GTK_APPLICATION_ID xprop.
  * BamfMatcher: Rename set our atom to _BAMF_DESKTOP_FILE.
  * Matcher: Use desktop file path when matching on
    _GTK_APPLICATION_ID.
  * BamfMatcher: Update special g-c-c code to unity-control-center
    (lp#1511481).
  * libBAMF: Cache active{window,application} and be smarter in
    reusing known resources.
  * BamfDaemon: Add upstart session support.
  * BamfMatcher: Don't assign no-display desktop files to windows
    by default when launched (lp#1519376).
  * Use startup notifications to set a "starting" property
    (lp#676457).
  * BamfMatcher: Avoid to register applications with invalid (empty
    or not existing) destkop files (lp#1560490).
  * BamfApplication: Bind window-{added,removed} signals to
    child-{added,removed} ones.
  * BamfWindow: Export window actions menu using dbusmenu
    (lp#1570812).
  * BamfApplication: Correctly set a main child when handling
    windows.
  * bamfdaemon-dbus-runner: Don't try to start again if already
    running (lp#1581896, lp#1532226).
  * BamfMatcher: Allow overriding desktop with the environment var
    BAMF_DESKTOP_FILE_HINT.
  * Daemon: Manually set to complete the startup notification on
    view state change (lp#1582430).
  * Add support for starting bamf through user systemd units.
  * Unscale x/y coordinates returned by top_window_action_menu
    (lp#1606234).
  * Adjust for XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP containing multiple
    colon-separated values.
