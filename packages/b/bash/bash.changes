-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec 14 14:52:27 UTC 2022 - Dr. Werner Fink <werner@suse.de>

- Add upstream patches
  * bash52-013
    Bash can leak memory when referencing a non-existent associative
    array element.
  * bash52-014
    Bash defers processing additional terminating signals when running
    the EXIT trap while exiting due to a terminating signal.  This
    patch allows the new terminating signal to kill the shell immediately.
  * bash52-015
    There are several cases where bash is too aggressive when optimizing
    out forks in subshells. For example, `eval' and traps should never
    be optimized.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov 28 11:33:24 UTC 2022 - Dr. Werner Fink <werner@suse.de>

- Add upstream patches
  * bash52-010
    Bash-5.2 checks the first 128 characters of an executable file that execve()
    refuses to execute to see whether it's a binary file before trying to
    execute it as a shell script. This defeats some previously-supported use
    cases like "self-executing" jar files or "self-uncompressing" scripts.
  * bash52-011
    Using timeouts and readline editing with the `read' builtin (read -e -t) can
    leave the readline timeout enabled, potentially resulting in an erroneous
    timeout on the next call.
  * bash52-012
    When running in bash compatibility mode, nested command substitutions can
    leave the `extglob' option enabled.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov  9 15:10:07 UTC 2022 - Dr. Werner Fink <werner@suse.de>

- Add upstream patches
  * bash52-003
    Command substitutions need to preserve newlines instead of replacing them
    with semicolons, especially in the presence of multiple here-documents.
  * bash52-004
    Bash needs to keep better track of nested brace expansions to avoid problems
    with quoting and POSIX semantics.
  * bash52-005
    Null pattern substitution replacement strings can cause a crash.
  * bash52-006
    In interactive shells, interrupting the shell while entering a command
    substitution can inhibit alias expansion.
  * bash52-007
    This patch fixes several problems with alias expansion inside command
    substitutions when in POSIX mode.
  * bash52-008
    Array subscript expansion can inappropriately quote brackets if the expression
    contains < or >.
  * bash52-009
    Bash arithmetic expansion should allow `@' and `*' to be used as associative
    array keys in expressions.

Thu Apr 28 11:59:44 UTC 2022 - Dr. Werner Fink <werner@suse.de>

- Update to bash 5.2 beta
  a. The bash malloc returns memory that is aligned on 16-byte boundaries.
  b. There is a new internal timer framework used for read builtin timeouts.
  c. Rewrote the command substitution parsing code to call the parser recursively
     and rebuild the command string from the parsed command. This allows better
     syntax checking and catches errors much earlier.
  d. The `ulimit' builtin now treats an operand remaining after all of the options
     and arguments are parsed as an argument to the last command specified by
     an option. This is for POSIX compatibility.
  e. Here-document parsing now handles $'...' and $"..." quoting when reading the
     here-document body.
  f. The `shell-expand-line' and `history-and-alias-expand-line' bindable readline
     commands now understand $'...' and $"..." quoting.
  g. There is a new `spell-correct-word' bindable readline command to perform
     spelling correction on the current word.
  h. The `unset' builtin now attempts to treat arguments as array subscripts
     without parsing or expanding the subscript, even when `assoc_expand_once'
     is not set.
  i. There is a default value for $BASH_LOADABLES_PATH in config-top.h.
  j. Associative array assignment and certain instances of referencing (e.g.,
     `test -v' now allow `@' and `*' to be used as keys.
  k. Bash attempts to expand indexed array subscripts only once when executing
     shell constructs and word expansions.
  l. The `unset' builtin allows a subscript of `@' or `*' to unset a key with
     that value for associative arrays instead of unsetting the entire array
     (which you can still do with `unset arrayname'). For indexed arrays, it
     removes all elements of the array without unsetting it (like `A=()').
  m. Additional builtins (printf/test/read/wait) do a better job of not
     parsing array subscripts if array_expand_once is set.
  n. New READLINE_ARGUMENT variable set to numeric argument for readline commands
     defined using `bind -x'.
  o. The new `varredir_close' shell option causes bash to automatically close
     file descriptors opened with {var}<fn and other styles of varassign
     redirection unless they're arguments to the `exec' builtin.
  p. The `$0' special parameter is now set to the name of the script when running
     any (non-interactive) startup files such as $BASH_ENV.
  q. The `enable' builtin tries to load a loadable builtin using the default
     search path if `enable name' (without any options) attempts to enable a
     non-existent builtin.
  r. The `printf' builtin has a new format specifier: %Q. This acts like %q but
     applies any specified precision to the original unquoted argument, then
     quotes and outputs the result.
  s. The new `noexpand_translations' option controls whether or not the translated
     output of $"..." is single-quoted.
  t. There is a new parameter transformation operator: @k. This is like @K, but
     expands the result to separate words after word splitting.
  u. There is an alternate array implementation, selectable at `configure' time,
     that optimizes access speed over memory use (use the new configure
      --enable-alt-array-implementation option).
  v. If an [N]<&WORD- or [N]>&WORD- redirection has WORD expand to the empty
     string, treat the redirection as [N]<&- or [N]>&- and close file descriptor
     N (default 0).
  w. Invalid parameter transformation operators are now invalid word expansions,
     and so cause fatal errors in non-interactive shells.
  x. New shell option: patsub_replacement. When enabled, a `&' in the replacement
     string of the pattern substitution expansion is replaced by the portion of
     the string that matched the pattern. Backslash will escape the `&' and
     insert a literal `&'.
  y. `command -p' no longer looks in the hash table for the specified command.
  z. The new `--enable-translatable-strings' option to `configure' allows $"..."
     support to be compiled in or out.
  aa. The new `globskipdots' shell option forces pathname expansion never to
      return `.' or `..' unless explicitly matched.
  bb. Array references using `@' and `*' that are the value of nameref variables
      (declare -n ref='v[@]' ; echo $ref) no longer cause the shell to exit if
      set -u is enabled and the array (v) is unset.
  cc. There is a new bindable readline command name:
      `vi-edit-and-execute-command'.

    Bash did not always perform tilde expansion following an unquoted colon on
    the rhs of an assignment statement in posix mode.
  * Add official patch bash51-014
    Bash may produce corrupted input if a multibyte character spans a 512-byte
    boundary while reading the output of a command substitution.
  * Add official patch bash51-015
    There are some characters (e.g., cyrillic) that can't be displayed using
    certain single-byte encodings (e.g., cp1251) because the negative signed
    int is interpreted as EOF and not displayed.
  * Add official patch bash51-016

- Update bash 5.1 to patch level 12
  * Add official patch bash51-009
    The bash malloc implementation of malloc_usable_size() does not follow the
    specification. This can cause library functions that use it to overwrite
    memory bounds checking.
  * Add official patch bash51-010
    If `wait -n' is interrupted by a trapped signal other than SIGINT, it does
    not completely clean up state, and that can prevent subsequent calls to
    `wait -n' from working correctly.
  * Add official patch bash51-011
    When reading a compound assignment, and running it through the parser to
    split it into words, we need to save and restore any alias we're currently
    expanding.
  * Add official patch bash51-012
    There is a possible race condition that arises when a child process receives
    a signal trapped by the parent before it can reset the signal dispositions.
    The child process is not supposed to trap the signal in this circumstance.

- Add official patch bash51-002
  If there are no jobs, and the `-n' and `-p' options are both supplied to
  `wait', bash can assign a value to the variable name specified with `-p'
  instead of leaving it unset.
- Add official patch bash51-003
  Bash does not put a command substitution process that is started to perform an
  expansion in a child process into the right process group where it can receive
  keyboard-generated signals.
- Add official patch bash51-004
  If a key-value compound array assignment to an associative array is supplied
  as an assignment statement argument to the `declare' command that declares the
  array, the assignment doesn't perform the correct word expansions.

  This patch makes key-value assignment and subscript assignment perform the
  same expansions when they're supplied as an argument to `declare'.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 12 17:19:06 UTC 2020 - Dr. Werner Fink <werner@suse.de>

- Update to bash 5.1 rc1
  * `bind -x' now supports different bindings for different editing modes and
    keymaps.
  * Bash attempts to optimize the number of times it forks when executing
    commands in subshells and from `bash -c'.
  * Here documents and here strings now use pipes for the expanded document if
    it's smaller than the pipe buffer size, reverting to temporary files if it's
    larger.
  * There are new loadable builtins: mktemp, accept, mkfifo, csv, cut/lcut
  * In posix mode, `trap -p' now displays signals whose disposition is SIG_DFL
    and those that were SIG_IGN when the shell starts.
  * The shell now expands the history number (e.g., in PS1) even if it is not
    currently saving commands to the history list.
  * `read -e' may now be used with arbitrary file descriptors (`read -u N').
  * The `select' builtin now runs traps if its internal call to the read builtin
    is interrupted by a signal.
  * SRANDOM: a new variable that expands to a 32-bit random number that is not
    produced by an LCRNG, and uses getrandom/getentropy, falling back to
    /dev/urandom or arc4random if available. There is a fallback generator if
    none of these are available.
  * shell-transpose-words: a new bindable readline command that uses the same
    definition of word as shell-forward-word, etc.
  * The shell now adds default bindings for shell-forward-word,
    shell-backward-word, shell-transpose-words, and shell-kill-word.
  * Bash now allows ARGV0 appearing in the initial shell environment to set $0.
  * If `unset' is executed without option arguments, bash tries to unset a shell
    function if a name argument cannot be a shell variable name because it's not
    an identifier.
  * The `test -N' operator uses nanosecond timestamp granularity if it's
    available.
  * Bash posix mode now treats assignment statements preceding shell function
    definitions the same as in its default mode, since POSIX has changed and
    no longer requires those assignments to persist after the function returns
    (POSIX interp 654).
  * BASH_REMATCH is no longer readonly.
  * wait: has a new -p VARNAME option, which stores the PID returned by `wait -n'
    or `wait' without arguments.
  * Sorting the results of pathname expansion now uses byte-by-byte comparisons
    if two strings collate equally to impose a total order; the result of a
    POSIX interpretation.
  * Bash now allows SIGINT trap handlers to execute recursively.
  * Bash now saves and restores state around setting and unsetting posix mode,
    instead of having unsetting posix mode set a known state.
  * Process substitution is now available in posix mode.
  * READLINE_MARK: a new variable available while executing commands bound with
    `bind -x', contains the value of the mark.
  * Bash removes SIGCHLD from the set of blocked signals if it's blocked at shell
    startup.
  * `test -v N' can now test whether or not positional parameter N is set.
  * `local' now honors the `-p' option to display all local variables at the
    current context.
  * The `@a' variable transformation now prints attributes for unset array
    variables.
  * The `@A' variable transformation now prints a declare command that sets a
    variable's attributes if the variable has attributes but is unset.
  * `declare' and `local' now have a -I option that inherits attributes and
    value from a variable with the same name at a previous scope.
  * When run from a -c command, `jobs' now reports the status of completed jobs.
  * New `U', `u', and `L' parameter transformations to convert to uppercase,
    convert first character to uppercase, and convert to lowercase,
    respectively.
  * PROMPT_COMMAND: can now be an  array variable, each element of which can
    contain a command to be executed like a string PROMPT_COMMAND variable.
  * `ulimit' has a -R option to report and set the RLIMIT_RTTIME resource.
  * Associative arrays may be assigned using a list of key-value pairs within
    a compound assignment. Compound assignments where the words are not of
    the form [key]=value are assumed to be key-value assignments. A missing or
    empty key is an error; a missing value is treated as NULL. Assignments may
    not mix the two forms.
  * New `K' parameter transformation to display associative arrays as key-
    value pairs.
  * Writing history to syslog now handles messages longer than the syslog max
    length by writing multiple messages with a sequence number.
  * SECONDS and RANDOM may now be assigned using arithmetic expressions, since
    they are nominally integer variables. LINENO is not an integer variable.
  * Bash temporarily suppresses the verbose option when running the DEBUG trap
    while running a command from the `fc' builtin.
  * `wait -n' now accepts a list of job specifications as arguments and will
    wait for the first one in the list to change state.
  * The associative array implementation can now dynamically increase the
    size of the hash table based on insertion patterns.
  * HISTFILE is now readonly in a restricted shell.
  * The bash malloc now returns memory that is 16-byte aligned on 64-bit
    systems.
  * If the hash builtin is listing hashed filenames portably, don't print
    anything if the table is empty.
  * GLOBIGNORE now ignores `.' and `..' as a terminal pathname component.
  * Bash attempts to optimize away forks in the last command in a function body
    under appropriate circumstances.
  * The globbing code now uses fnmatch(3) to check collation elements (if
    available) even in cases without multibyte characters.
  * The `fg' and `bg' builtins now return an error in a command substitution
    when asked to restart a job inherited from the parent shell.
  * The shell now attempts to unlink all FIFOs on exit, whether a consuming
    process has finished with them or not.
  * There is a new contributed loadable builtin: asort.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb 13 10:56:07 UTC 2020 - Dr. Werner Fink <werner@suse.de>

- Add official patch bash50-012
  When using previous-history to go back beyond the beginning of the history list,
  it's possible to move to an incorrect partial line.
- Add official patch bash50-013
  Reading history entries with timestamps can result in history entries joined
  by linefeeds.
- Add official patch bash50-014
  If the current line is empty, using the emacs C-xC-e binding to enter the
  editor will edit the previous command instead of the current (empty) one.
- Add official patch bash50-015
  If alias expansion is enabled when processing the command argument to the
  `-c' option, an alias is defined in that command, and the command ends with
  the invocation of that alias, the shell's command parser can prematurely
  terminate before the entire command is executed.
- Add official patch bash50-016
  Bash waits too long to reap /dev/fd process substitutions used as redirections
  with loops and group commands, which can lead to file descriptor exhaustion.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct 16 12:49:36 UTC 2019 - Dr. Werner Fink <werner@suse.de>

- Remove PILOTPORT and PILOTRATE environment variable from
  default ~/.bashrc (/etc/skel/.bashrc) (bsc#1123510)

  The conditional command did not perform appropriate quoted null
  character removal on its arguments, causing syntax errors and
  attempts to stat invalid pathnames.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep  4 09:08:53 UTC 2019 - Ludwig Nussel <lnussel@suse.de>

- Avoid pulling in bash-doc into every installation. Instead of
  recommeding it, supplement the documentation pattern.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug 15 13:43:55 UTC 2019 - Dr. Werner Fink <werner@suse.de>

- Add official patch bash50-008
  When HISTSIZE is set to 0, history expansion can leave the history length
  set to an incorrect value, leading to subsequent attempts to access invalid
  memory.
- Add official patch bash50-009 
  The history file reading code doesn't close the file descriptor open to
  the history file when it encounters a zero-length file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr 23 12:58:16 UTC 2019 - Dr. Werner Fink <werner@suse.de>

- Add official patch bash50-004
  * In bash-5.0, the `wait' builtin without arguments waits for all children of the
    shell. This includes children it `inherited' at shell invocation time. This
    patch modifies the behavior to not wait for these inherited children, some
    of which might be long-lived.
- Add official patch bash50-005
  * In certain cases, bash optimizes out a fork() call too early and prevents
    traps from running.
- Add official patch bash50-006
  * Bash-5.0 did not build successfully if SYSLOG_HISTORY was defined without
    also defining SYSLOG_SHOPT.
- Add official patch bash50-007
  * Running `exec' when job control was disabled, even temporarily, but after it
    had been initialized, could leave the terminal in the wrong process group for
    the executed process.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan  9 12:47:04 UTC 2019 - Dr. Werner Fink <werner@suse.de>

- Update to bash 5.0 (final)
  a. Tilde expansion isn't performed on indexed array subscripts, even for
     backwards compatibility.
  b. The shell doesn't exit in posix mode if the eval builtin gets a parse
     error when run by the command builtin.
  c. Fixed a bug that caused a shell comment in an alias to not find the end
     of the alias properly.
  d. Reverted a change from April, 2018 that caused strings containing
     backslashes to be flagged as glob patterns.
- Modify patches
  * bash-2.03-manual.patch
  * bash-4.3-loadables.dif
  * bash-5.0.dif

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Dec 21 13:34:47 UTC 2018 - Dr. Werner Fink <werner@suse.de>

- Update to bash 5.0 rc1
  a. Fix to initial word completion detection code.
  b. Fixed a bug that caused issues with assignment statements containing ^A in
     the value assigned when IFS contains ^A.
  c. Added a fallback to fnmatch() when strcoll can't correctly deal with
     bracket expression character equivalence classes.
  d. Fixed a bug that caused $BASH_COMMAND to contain the trap handler command
     when running a trap handler containing [[ or (( commands.
  e. Fixed a bug that caused nameref assignments in the temporary environment
     to potentially create variables with invalid names.
  f. Fixed a bug that caused `local -' to turn off alias expansion in scripts.
  g. Fixed a parser issue with a command string containing EOF after an invalid
     command as an argument to a special builtin not causing a posix-mode shell
     to exit.
  h. Made a slight change to the FNV-1 string hash algorithm used for associative
     arrays (corrected the initial seed).
  a. The `select' command now supports command forms without a word list
     following `in'.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov 29 08:22:16 UTC 2018 - Dr. Werner Fink <werner@suse.de>

- Update to bash 5.0 beta2
  ii. Associative and indexed arrays now allow subscripts consisting solely of
      whitespace.
  jj. `checkwinsize' is now enabled by default.
  kk. The `localvar_unset' shopt option is now visible and documented.
  ll. The `progcomp_alias' shopt option is now visible and documented.
  mm. The signal name processing code now understands `SIGRTMIN+n' all the way
      up to SIGRTMAX.
  nn. There is a new `seq' loadable builtin.
  oo. Trap execution now honors the (internal) max invocations of `eval', since
      traps are supposed to be executed as if using `eval'.
  pp. The $_ variable doesn't change when the shell executes a command that forks.
  qq. The `kill' builtin now supports -sSIGNAME and -nSIGNUM, even though
      conforming applications aren't supposed to use them.
  rr. POSIX mode now enables the `shift_verbose' option.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 20 08:56:46 UTC 2018 - Dr. Werner Fink <werner@suse.de>

- Update to bash 5.0 beta
  a. The `wait' builtin can now wait for the last process substitution created.
  b. There is an EPOCHSECONDS variable, which expands to the time in seconds
     since the Unix epoch.
  c. There is an EPOCHREALTIME variable, which expands to the time in seconds
     since the Unix epoch with microsecond granularity.
  d. New loadable builtins: rm, stat, fdflags.
  e. BASH_ARGV0: a new variable that expands to $0 and sets $0 on assignment.
  f. When supplied a numeric argument, the shell-expand-line bindable readline
     command does not perform quote removal and suppresses command and process
     substitution.
  g. `history -d' understands negative arguments: negative arguments offset from
     the end of the history list.
  h. The `name' argument to the `coproc' reserved word now undergoes word
     expansion, so unique coprocs can be created in loops.
  i. A nameref name resolution loop in a function now resolves to a variable by
     that name in the global scope.
  j. The `wait' builtin now has a `-f' option, which signfies to wait until the
     specified job or process terminates, instead of waiting until it changes
     state.
  k. There is a define in config-top.h that allows the shell to use a static
     value for $PATH, overriding whatever is in the environment at startup, for
     use by the restricted shell.
  l. Process substitution does not inherit the `v' option, like command
     substitution.
  m. If a non-interactive shell with job control enabled detects that a foreground
     job died due to SIGINT, it acts as if it received the SIGINT.
  n. The SIGCHLD trap is run once for each exiting child process even if job
     control is not enabled when the shell is in Posix mode.
  o. A new shopt option: localvar_inherit; if set, a local variable inherits the
     value of a variable with the same name at the nearest preceding scope.
  p. `bind -r' now checks whether a key sequence is bound before binding it to
     NULL, to avoid creating keymaps for a multi-key sequence.
  q. A numeric argument to the line editing `operate-and-get-next' command
     specifies which history entry to use.
  r. The positional parameters are now assigned before running the shell startup
     files, so startup files can use $@.
  s. There is a compile-time option that forces the shell to disable the check
     for an inherited OLDPWD being a directory.
  t. The `history' builtin can now delete ranges of history entries using
     `-d start-end'.
  u. The `vi-edit-and-execute-command' bindable readline command now puts readline
     back in vi insertion mode after executing commands from the edited file.
  v. The command completion code now matches aliases and shell function names
     case-insensitively if the readline completion-ignore-case variable is set.
  w. There is a new `assoc_expand_once' shell option that attempts to expand
     associative array subscripts only once.
  x. The shell only sets up BASH_ARGV and BASH_ARGC at startup if extended
     debugging mode is active. The old behavior of unconditionally setting them
     is available as part of the shell compatibility options.
  y. The `umask' builtin now allows modes and masks greater than octal 777.
  z. The `times' builtin now honors the current locale when printing a decimal
     point.
  aa. There is a new (disabled by default, undocumented) shell option to enable
      and disable sending history to syslog at runtime.
  bb. Bash no longer allows variable assignments preceding a special builtin that
      changes variable attributes to propagate back to the calling environment
      unless the compatibility level is 44 or lower.
  cc. You can set the default value for $HISTSIZE at build time in config-top.h.
  dd. The `complete' builtin now accepts a -I option that applies the completion
      to the initial word on the line.
  ee. The internal bash malloc now uses mmap (if available) to satisfy requests
      greater than 128K bytes, so free can use mfree to return the pages to the
      kernel.
  ff. The shell doesn't automatically set BASH_ARGC and BASH_ARGV at startup
      unless it's in debugging mode, as the documentation has always said, but
      will dynamically create them if a script references them at the top level
      without having enabled debugging mode.
  gg. The localvar_inherit option will not attempt to inherit a value from a
      variable of an incompatible type (indexed vs. associative arrays, for
      example).
  hh. The `globasciiranges' option is now enabled by default; it can be set to
      off by default at configuration time.

Sat Jun  2 17:17:13 UTC 2018 - avindra@opensuse.org

- Add patch 20, 21, 22 and 23 to bash-4.4-patches.tar.bz2
  * 20: In circumstances involving long-running scripts that create
    and reap many processes, it is possible for the hash table bash
    uses to store exit statuses from asynchronous processes to
    develop loops. This patch fixes the loop causes and adds code
    to detect any future loops.
  * 21: A SIGINT received inside a SIGINT trap handler can possibly
    cause the shell to loop.
  * 22: There are cases where a failing readline command (e.g.,
    delete-char at the end of a line) can cause a multi-character
    key sequence to `back up' and attempt to re-read some of the
    characters in the sequence.
  * 23: When sourcing a file from an interactive shell, setting the
    SIGINT handler to the default and typing ^C will cause the
    shell to exit.
- remove bash-4.4-wait-sigint-handler.patch (upstreamed)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb  6 23:25:18 UTC 2018 - avindra@opensuse.org

- Add patch 19 to bash-4.4-patches.tar.bz2
  * With certain values for PS1, especially those that wrap onto
    three or more lines, readline will miscalculate the number of
    invisible characters, leading to crashes and core dumps.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan 30 01:42:43 UTC 2018 - avindra@opensuse.org

- Add patches 13-18 to bash-4.4-patches.tar.bz2
  * 13: If a here-document contains a command substitution, the
    command substitution can get access to the file descriptor used
    to write the here-document.
  * 14: Under some circumstances, functions that return via the
    `return' builtin do not clean up memory they allocated to keep
    track of FIFOs.
  * 15: Process substitution can leak internal quoting to the
    parser in the invoked subshell.
  * 16: Bash can perform trap processing while reading command
    substitution output instead of waiting until the command
    completes.
  * 17: There is a memory leak when `read -e' is used to read a
    line using readline.
  * 18: Under certain circumstances (e.g., reading from /dev/zero),
    read(2) will not return -1 even when interrupted by a signal.
    The read builtin needs to check for signals in this case.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 30 16:11:13 UTC 2017 - werner@suse.de

- Add upstream patch readline70-002 which replace old one
  There is a race condition in add_history() that can be triggered by a fatal
  signal arriving between the time the history length is updated and the time
  the history list update is completed. A later attempt to reference an
  invalid history entry can cause a crash.
- Add upstream patch readline70-003
  Readline-7.0 uses pselect(2) to allow readline to handle signals that do not
  interrupt read(2), such as SIGALRM, before reading another character.  The
  signal mask used in the pselect call did not take into account signals the
  calling application blocked before calling readline().

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan 27 17:31:59 UTC 2017 - werner@suse.de

- Add upstream patch bash44-006 
  Out-of-range negative offsets to popd can cause the shell to crash
  attempting to free an invalid memory block.
- Remove patch popd-offset-overflow.patch to use bash44-006
- Add upstream patch bash44-007 
  When performing filename completion, bash dequotes the directory
  name being completed, which can result in match failures and
  potential unwanted expansion.
- Duplicate bash44-007 as readline70-002 as it seems to be missed
- Add upstream patch bash44-008 
  Under certain circumstances, bash will evaluate arithmetic
  expressions as part of reading an expression token even when
  evaluation is suppressed. This happens while evaluating a
  conditional expression and skipping over the failed branch of the
  expression.
- Add upstream patch bash44-009 
  There is a race condition in add_history() that can be triggered
  by a fatal signal arriving between the time the history length
  is updated and the time the history list update is completed.
  A later attempt to reference an invalid history entry can cause
  a crash.
- Add upstream patch bash44-010 
  Depending on compiler optimizations and behavior, the `read'
  builtin may not save partial input when a timeout occurs.
- Add upstream patch bash44-011 
  Subshells begun to run command and process substitutions may
  attempt to set the terminal's process group to an incorrect
  value if they receive a fatal signal.  This depends on the
  behavior of the process that starts the shell.
- Add upstream patch bash44-012 
  When -N is used, the input is not supposed to be split using
  $IFS, but leading and trailing IFS whitespace was still removed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 19 12:20:06 UTC 2017 - werner@suse.de

-  Add upstream patch popd-offset-overflow.patch to fix boo#1010845
   CVE-2016-9401: bash: popd controlled free (Segmentation fault)
   Remark: this is a simple Segmentation fault, no security risk

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov 17 09:27:21 UTC 2016 - werner@suse.de

- Add upstream patch bash44-001
  Bash-4.4 changed the way the history list is initially allocated to reduce
  the number of reallocations and copies.  Users who set HISTSIZE to a very
  large number to essentially unlimit the size of the history list will get
  memory allocation errors 
- Add upstream patch bash44-002
  Bash-4.4 warns when discarding NUL bytes in command substitution output
  instead of silently dropping them.  This patch changes the warnings from
  one per NUL byte encountered to one warning per command substitution.
- Drop no-null-warning.patch as bash44-002 is official replacement
- Add upstream patch bash44-003
  Specially-crafted input, in this case an incomplete pathname expansion
  bracket expression containing an invalid collating symbol, can cause the
  shell to crash.
- Add upstream patch bash44-004
  There is a race condition that can result in bash referencing freed memory
  when freeing data associated with the last process substitution.
- Add upstream patch bash44-005
  Under certain circumstances, a simple command is optimized to eliminate a
  fork, resulting in an EXIT trap not being executed. (boo#1008459)
- Add upstream patch readline70-001
  Readline-7.0 changed the way the history list is initially allocated to reduce
  the number of reallocations and copies.  Users who set the readline
  history-size variable to a very large number to essentially unlimit the size
  of the history list will get memory allocation errors

  * New application-settable variable: rl_persistent_signal_handlers: if set
   to a non-zero value, readline will enable the readline-6.2 signal handler
   behavior in callback mode: handlers are installed when
   rl_callback_handler_install is called and removed removed when a complete
   line has been read.
- Drop patch bash-4.3-async-bnc971410.dif as this one is part of 4.4
- Drop patch bash-3.2-longjmp.dif as now long time be fixed
- Drop patch bash-4.3-headers.dif as loadables now simply work
- Drop readline-6.1-wrap.patch as this seems to be fixed
- Disable patch bash-4.0-async-bnc523667.dif for now as it seems to be fixed
  in an other way

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 14 09:00:14 UTC 2016 - werner@suse.de

- Update bash 4.4 rc2  -- Bugfixes
- Update readline 7.0 rc2 -- Bugfixes

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug  1 13:47:05 UTC 2016 - werner@suse.de

- Make clear that the files /etc/profile as well as /etc/bash.bashrc
  may source other files as well even if the bash does not.
  Therefore modify patch bash-4.1-bash.bashrc.dif (bsc#959755)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul 14 12:43:08 UTC 2016 - werner@suse.de

- Update bash 4.4 beta 2 
  * Value conversions (arithmetic expansions, case modification, etc.) now
    happen when assigning elements of an array using compound assignment.
  * There is a new option settable in config-top.h that makes multiple
    directory arguments to `cd' a fatal error.
  * Bash now uses mktemp() when creating internal temporary files; it produces
    a warning at build time on many Linux systems.
- Update to readline library 7.0 beta 2 (not enabled as not standalone)
  * The default binding for ^W in vi mode now uses word boundaries specified
    by Posix (vi-unix-word-rubout is bindable command name).
  * rl_clear_visible_line: new application-callable function; clears all
    screen lines occupied by the current visible readline line.
  * rl_tty_set_echoing: application-callable function that controls whether
    or not readline thinks it is echoing terminal output.
  * Handle >| and strings of digits preceding and following redirection
    specifications as single tokens when tokenizing the line for history
    expansion.
  * Fixed a bug with displaying completions when the prefix display length
    is greater than the length of the completions to be displayed.
  * The :p history modifier now applies to the entire line, so any expansion
    specifying :p causes the line to be printed instead of expanded.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar  8 14:49:41 UTC 2016 - werner@suse.de

- Update bash 4.4 release candidate 1
  * There is now a settable configuration #define that will cause the shell
    to exit if the shell is running setuid without the -p option and setuid
    to the real uid fails.
  * Command and process substitutions now turn off the `-v' option when
    executing, as other shells seem to do.
  * The default value for the `checkhash' shell option may now be set at
    compile time with a #define.
  * The `mapfile' builtin now has a -d option to use an arbitrary character
    as the record delimiter, and a -t option  to strip the delimiter as
    supplied with -d.
  * The maximum number of nested recursive calls to `eval' is now settable in
    config-top.h; the default is no limit.
  * The `-p' option to declare and similar builtins will display attributes for
    named variables even when those variables have not been assigned values
    (which are technically unset).
  * The maximum number of nested recursive calls to `source' is now settable
    in config-top.h; the default is no limit.
  * All builtin commands recognize the `--help' option and print a usage
    summary.
  * Bash does not allow function names containing `/' and `=' to be exported.
  * The `ulimit' builtin has new -k (kqueues) and -P (pseudoterminals) options.
  * The shell now allows `time ; othercommand' to time null commands.
  * There is a new `--enable-function-import' configuration option to allow
    importing shell functions from the environment; import is enabled by
    default.
  * `printf -v var ""' will now set `var' to the empty string, as if `var=""'
    had been executed.
  * GLOBIGNORE, the pattern substitution word expansion, and programmable
    completion match filtering now honor the value of the `nocasematch' option.
  * There is a new ${parameter@spec} family of operators to transform the
    value of `parameter'.
  * Bash no longer attempts to perform compound assignment if a variable on the
    rhs of an assignment statement argument to `declare' has the form of a
    compound assignment (e.g., w='(word)' ; declare foo=$w); compound
    assignments are accepted if the variable was already declared as an array,
    but with a warning.
  * The declare builtin no longer displays array variables using the compound
    assignment syntax with quotes; that will generate warnings when re-used as
    input, and isn't necessary.
  * Executing the rhs of && and || will no longer cause the shell to fork if
    it's not necessary.
  * The `local' builtin takes a new argument: `-', which will cause it to save
    and the single-letter shell options and restore their previous values at
    function return.
  * `complete' and `compgen' have a new `-o nosort' option, which forces
    readline to not sort the completion matches.
  * Bash now allows waiting for the most recent process substitution, since it
    appears as $!.
  * The `unset' builtin now unsets a scalar variable if it is subscripted with
    a `0', analogous to the ${var[0]} expansion.
  * `set -i' is no longer valid, as in other shells.
  * BASH_SUBSHELL is now updated for process substitution and group commands
    in pipelines, and is available with the same value when running any exit
    trap.
  * Bash now checks $INSIDE_EMACS as well as $EMACS when deciding whether or
    not bash is being run in a GNU Emacs shell window.
  * Bash now treats SIGINT received when running a non-builtin command in a
    loop the way it has traditionally treated running a builtin command:
    running any trap handler and breaking out of the loop.
  * New variable: EXECIGNORE; a colon-separate list of patterns that will
    cause matching filenames to be ignored when searching for commands.
  * Aliases whose value ends in a shell metacharacter now expand in a way to
    allow them to be `pasted' to the next token, which can potentially change
    the meaning of a command (e.g., turning `&' into `&&').
  * `make install' now installs the example loadable builtins and a set of
    bash headers to use when developing new loadable builtins.
  * `enable -f' now attempts to call functions named BUILTIN_builtin_load when
    loading BUILTIN, and BUILTIN_builtin_unload when deleting it.  This allows
    loadable builtins to run initialization and cleanup code.
  * There is a new BASH_LOADABLES_PATH variable containing a list of directories
    where the `enable -f' command looks for shared objects containing loadable
    builtins.
  * The `complete_fullquote' option to `shopt' changes filename completion to
    quote all shell metacharacters in filenames and directory names.
  * The `kill' builtin now has a `-L' option, equivalent to `-l', for
    compatibility with Linux standalone versions of kill.
  * BASH_COMPAT and FUNCNEST can be inherited and set from the shell's initial
    environment.
  * inherit_errexit: a new `shopt' option that, when set, causes command
    substitutions to inherit the -e option.  By default, those subshells disable
    -e.  It's enabled as part of turning on posix mode.
  *  New prompt string: PS0.  Expanded and displayed by interactive shells after
    reading a complete command but before executing it.
  *  Interactive shells now behave as if SIGTSTP/SIGTTIN/SIGTTOU are set to SIG_DFL
    when the shell is started, so they are set to SIG_DFL in child processes.
  * Posix-mode shells now allow double quotes to quote the history expansion
    character.
  * OLDPWD can be inherited from the environment if it names a directory.
  * Shells running as root no longer inherit PS4 from the environment, closing a
    security hole involving PS4 expansion performing command substitution.
  *  If executing an implicit `cd' when the `autocd' option is set, bash will now
    invoke a function named `cd' if one exists before executing the `cd' builtin.
- Update to readline library 7.0 release candidate 1
  * The history truncation code now uses the same error recovery mechansim as
    the history writing code, and restores the old version of the history file
    on error.  The error recovery mechanism handles symlinked history files.
  * There is a new bindable variable, `enable-bracketed-paste', which enables
    support for a terminal's bracketed paste mode.
  * The editing mode indicators can now be strings and are user-settable
    (new `emacs-mode-string', `vi-cmd-mode-string' and `vi-ins-mode-string'
    variables).  Mode strings can contain invisible character sequences.
    Setting mode strings to null strings restores the defaults.
  * Prompt expansion adds the mode string to the last line of a multi-line
    prompt (one with embedded newlines).
  * There is a new bindable variable, `colored-completion-prefix', which, if
    set, causes the common prefix of a set of possible completions to be
    displayed in color.
  * There is a new bindable command `vi-yank-pop', a vi-mode version of emacs-
    mode yank-pop.
  * The redisplay code underwent several efficiency improvements for multibyte
    locales.
  * The insert-char function attempts to batch-insert all pending typeahead
    that maps to self-insert, as long as it is coming from the terminal.
  * rl_callback_sigcleanup: a new application function that can clean up and
    unset any state set by readline's callback mode.  Intended to be used
    after a signal.
  * If an incremental search string has its last character removed with DEL, the
    resulting empty search string no longer matches the previous line.
  * If readline reads a history file that begins with `#' (or the value of
    the history comment character) and has enabled history timestamps, the history
    entries are assumed to be delimited by timestamps.  This allows multi-line
    history entries.
  * Readline now throws an error if it parses a key binding without a terminating
    `:' or whitespace.

Mon Oct 19 13:38:58 UTC 2015 - werner@suse.de

- Define the USE_MKTEMP and USE_MKSTEMP cpp macros as the
  implementation is already there.
- Add patch bash-4.3-pathtemp.patch to allow root to clear the
  file systems.  Otherwise the completion does not work if /tmp
  if full (ENOSPC for here documents)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct 16 13:02:27 UTC 2015 - werner@suse.de

- Remove --hash-size options as there is no any change in the final
  binary nor library anymore

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 31 11:23:11 UTC 2015 - werner@suse.de

- Add upstream patch bash43-039
  Using the output of `declare -p' when run in a function can result in variables
  that are invisible to `declare -p'.  This problem occurs when an assignment
  builtin such as `declare' receives a quoted compound array assignment as one of
  its arguments.
- Add upstream patch bash43-040
  There is a memory leak that occurs when bash expands an array reference on
  the rhs of an assignment statement.
- Add upstream patch bash43-041
  There are several out-of-bounds read errors that occur when completing command
  lines where assignment statements appear before the command name.  The first
  two appear only when programmable completion is enabled; the last one only
  happens when listing possible completions.
- Add upstream patch bash43-042
  There is a problem when parsing command substitutions containing `case'
  commands within pipelines that causes the parser to not correctly identify
  the end of the command substitution.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul  1 08:31:09 UTC 2015 - coolo@suse.com

  (defined(@array) has been deprecated since at least 2012)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 28 08:50:30 UTC 2015 - werner@suse.de

- Add upstream patch bash43-034
  If neither the -f nor -v options is supplied to unset, and a name argument is
  found to be a function and unset, subsequent name arguments are not treated as
  variables before attempting to unset a function by that name.
- Add upstream patch bash43-035
  A locale with a long name can trigger a buffer overflow and core dump.  This
  applies on systems that do not have locale_charset in libc, are not using
  GNU libiconv, and are not using the libintl that ships with bash in lib/intl.
- Add upstream patch bash43-036
  When evaluating and setting integer variables, and the assignment fails to
  create a variable (for example, when performing an operation on an array
  variable with an invalid subscript), bash attempts to dereference a null
  pointer, causing a segmentation violation.
- Add upstream patch bash43-037
  If an associative array uses `@' or `*' as a subscript, `declare -p' produces
  output that cannot be reused as input.
- Add upstream patch bash43-038
  There are a number of instances where `time' is not recognized as a reserved
  word when the shell grammar says it should be.

- bash-4.3-loadables.dif: One more warning fixed, in
  examples/loadables/logname.c.
- bash-4.3-loadables.dif: Reverted one warning fix, which was
  introducing another warning and possibly a bug.

- bash-4.3-loadables.dif: Split changes to shell.h to a separate
  patch "bash-4.3-include-unistd.dif", as the loadables build just
  fine without these changes.
- bash-4.3-loadables.dif: Drop all header file inclusion fixups,
  upstream fixed the problem differently 5 years ago.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan  9 13:11:03 UTC 2015 - werner@suse.de

- Add upstream patch bash43-031
  The new nameref assignment functionality introduced in bash-4.3 did not perform
  enough validation on the variable value and would create variables with
  invalid names.
- Add upstream patch bash43-032
  When bash is running in Posix mode, it allows signals -- including SIGCHLD --
  to interrupt the `wait' builtin, as Posix requires.  However, the interrupt
  causes bash to not run a SIGCHLD trap for all exited children.  This patch
  fixes the issue and restores the documented behavior in Posix mode.
- Add upstream patch bash43-033
  Bash does not clean up the terminal state in all cases where bash or
  readline  modifies it and bash is subsequently terminated by a fatal signal.
  This happens when the `read' builtin modifies the terminal settings, both
  when readline is active and when it is not.  It occurs most often when a script
  installs a trap that exits on a signal without re-sending the signal to itself.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug 19 13:49:46 UTC 2014 - werner@suse.de

- Update to bash 4.3 with patch level 24
  * The -t timeout option to `read' does not work when the -e option is used
  * When PS2 contains a command substitution, here-documents entered in an
    interactive shell can sometimes cause a segmentation fault.
  * When the readline `revert-all-at-newline' option is set, pressing newline
    when the current line is one retrieved from history results in a double free
    and a segmentation fault.
  * Using nested pipelines within loops with the `lastpipe' option set can result
    in a segmentation fault.
  * Bash does not correctly parse process substitution constructs that contain
    unbalanced parentheses as part of the contained command.
  * Indirect variable references do not work correctly if the reference
    variable expands to an array reference using a subscript other than 0

- Don't use outdated C standard

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May 20 16:35:55 UTC 2014 - werner@suse.de

- Update to bash 4.3 with patch level 18
  *When a SIGCHLD trap runs a command containing a shell builtin while
    a script is running `wait' to wait for all running children to complete,
    the SIGCHLD trap will not be run once for each child that terminates.
  * Using reverse-i-search when horizontal scrolling is enabled doe
    not redisplay the entire line containing the successful search results.
  * Under certain circumstances, $@ is expanded incorrectly in contexts where
    word splitting is not performed.
  * When completing directory names, the directory name is dequoted twice.
    This causes problems for directories with single and double quotes in
    their names.
  * An extended glob pattern containing a slash (`/') causes the globbing code
    to misinterpret it as a directory separator.
  * The code that creates local variables should not clear the `invisible'
    attribute when returning an existing local variable.  Let the code that
    actually assigns a value clear it.
  * When assigning an array variable using the compound assignment syntax,
    but using `declare' with the rhs of the compound assignment quoted, the
    shell did not mark the variable as visible after successfully performing
    the assignment.
- Update to readline library 6.3 with patch level 6
  * Using reverse-i-search when horizontal scrolling is enabled does
    not redisplay the entire line containing the successful search results.
- Remove readline-horizontal-redisplay.patch as now upstream
- Rename readline-6.2.dif to readline-6.3.dif and bash-4.2.dif to bash-4.3.dif

- Make patch command work on older products

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 17 11:09:35 UTC 2014 - werner@suse.de

- Update to bash 4.3 with patch level 11
  * The `helptopic' completion action now maps to all the help topics, not just
    the shell builtins.
  * The `help' builtin no longer does prefix substring matching first, so
    `help read' does not match `readonly', but will do it if exact string
    matching fails.
  * The shell can be compiled to not display a message about processes that
    terminate due to SIGTERM.
  * Non-interactive shells now react to the setting of checkwinsize and set
    LINES and COLUMNS after a foreground job exits.
  * There is a new shell option, `globasciiranges', which, when set to on,
    forces globbing range comparisons to use character ordering as if they
    were run in the C locale.
  * There is a new shell option, `direxpand', which makes filename completion
    expand variables in directory names in the way bash-4.1 did.
  * In Posix mode, the `command' builtin does not change whether or not a
    builtin it shadows is treated as an assignment builtin.
  * The `return' and `exit' builtins accept negative exit status arguments.
  * The word completion code checks whether or not a filename containing a
    shell variable expands to a directory name and appends `/' to the word
    as appropriate.  The same code expands shell variables in command names
    when performing command completion.
  * In Posix mode, it is now an error to attempt to define a shell function
    with the same name as a Posix special builtin.
  * When compiled for strict Posix conformance, history expansion is disabled
    by default.
  * The history expansion character (!) does not cause history expansion when
    followed by the closing quote in a double-quoted string.
  * `complete' and its siblings compgen/compopt now takes a new `-o noquote'
    option to inhibit quoting of the completions.
  * Setting HISTSIZE to a value less than zero causes the history list to be
    unlimited (setting it 0 zero disables the history list).
  * Setting HISTFILESIZE to a value less than zero causes the history file size
    to be unlimited (setting it to 0 causes the history file to be truncated
    to zero size).
  * The `read' builtin now skips NUL bytes in the input.
  * There is a new `bind -X' option to print all key sequences bound to Unix
    commands.
  * When in Posix mode, `read' is interruptible by a trapped signal.  After
    running the trap handler, read returns 128+signal and throws away any
    partially-read input.
  * The command completion code skips whitespace and assignment statements
    before looking for the command name word to be completed.
  * The build process has a new mechanism for constructing separate help files
    that better reflects the current set of compilation options.
  * The -nt and -ot options to test now work with files with nanosecond
    timestamp resolution.
  * The shell saves the command history in any shell for which history is
    enabled and HISTFILE is set, not just interactive shells.
  * The shell has `nameref' variables and new -n(/+n) options to declare and
    unset to use them, and a `test -R' option to test for them.
  * The shell now allows assigning, referencing, and unsetting elements of
    indexed arrays using negative subscripts (a[-1]=2, echo ${a[-1]}) which
    count back from the last element of the array.
  * The {x}<word redirection feature now allows words like {array[ind]} and
    can use variables with special meanings to the shell (e.g., BASH_XTRACEFD).
  * There is a new CHILD_MAX special shell variable; its value controls the
    number of exited child statues the shell remembers.
  * There is a new configuration option (--enable-direxpand-default) that
    causes the `direxpand' shell option to be enabled by default.
  * Bash does not do anything special to ensure that the file descriptor
    assigned to X in {x}<foo remains open after the block containing it
    completes.
  * The `wait' builtin has a new `-n' option to wait for the next child to
    change status.
  * The `printf' %(...)T format specifier now uses the current time if no
    argument is supplied.
  * There is a new variable, BASH_COMPAT, that controls the current shell
    compatibility level.
  * The `popd' builtin now treats additional arguments as errors.
  * The brace expansion code now treats a failed sequence expansion as a
    simple string and will continue to expand brace terms in the remainder
    of the word.
  * Shells started to run process substitutions now run any trap set on EXIT.
  * The fc builtin now interprets -0 as the current command line.
  * Completing directory names containing shell variables now adds a trailing
    slash if the expanded result is a directory.
  * `cd' has a new `-@' option to browse a file's extended attributes on
    systems that support O_XATTR.
  * The test/[/[[ `-v variable' binary operator now understands array
    references.
- Update to readline library 6.3 with patch level 5
  * Readline is now more responsive to SIGHUP and other fatal signals when
    reading input from the terminal or performing word completion but no
    longer attempts to run any not-allowable functions from a signal handler
    context.
  * There are new bindable commands to search the history for the string of
    characters between the beginning of the line and the point
    (history-substring-search-forward, history-substring-search-backward)
  * Readline allows quoted strings as the values of variables when setting
    them with `set'.  As a side effect, trailing spaces and tabs are ignored
    when setting a string variable's value.
  * The history library creates a backup of the history file when writing it
    and restores the backup on a write error.
  * New application-settable variable: rl_filename_stat_hook: a function called
    with a filename before using it in a call to stat(2).  Bash uses it to
    expand shell variables so things like $HOME/Downloads have a slash
    appended.
  * New bindable function `print-last-kbd-macro', prints the most-recently-
    defined keyboard macro in a reusable format.
  * New user-settable variable `colored-stats', enables use of colored text
    to denote file types when displaying possible completions (colored analog
    of visible-stats).
  * New user-settable variable `keyseq-timout', acts as an inter-character
    timeout when reading input or incremental search strings.
  * New application-callable function: rl_clear_history. Clears the history list
    and frees all readline-associated private data.
  * New user-settable variable, show-mode-in-prompt, adds a characters to the
    beginning of the prompt indicating the current editing mode.
  * New application-settable variable: rl_input_available_hook; function to be
    called when readline detects there is data available on its input file
    descriptor.
  * Readline calls an application-set event hook (rl_event_hook) after it gets
    a signal while reading input (read returns -1/EINTR but readline does not
    handle the signal immediately) to allow the application to handle or
    otherwise note it.
  * If the user-settable variable `history-size' is set to a value less than
    0, the history list size is unlimited.
  * New application-settable variable: rl_signal_event_hook; function that is
    called when readline is reading terminal input and read(2) is interrupted
    by a signal.  Currently not called for SIGHUP or SIGTERM.
  * rl_change_environment: new application-settable variable that controls
    whether or not Readline modifies the environment (currently readline
    modifies only LINES and COLUMNS).

- Update bash 4.2 to patch level 45
  * When SIGCHLD is trapped, and a SIGCHLD trap handler runs when
    a pending `read -t' invocation times out and generates SIGALRM,
    bash can crash with a segmentation fault.
  * When converting a multibyte string to a wide character string
    as part of pattern matching, bash does not handle the end of
    the string correctly, causing the search for the NUL to go
    beyond the end of the string and reference random memory.
    Depending on the contents of that memory, bash can produce
    errors or crash. 
  * The <&n- and >&n- redirections, which move one file descriptor
    to another, leave the file descriptor closed when applied to
    builtins or compound commands.

Mon Jul  9 10:54:51 UTC 2012 - werner@suse.de

- Update bash 4.2 to patch level 36
  * Patch 25: When used in a shell function,
    `declare -g -a array=(compound assignment)' creates a local
    variable instead of a global one.
  * Patch 26: The `lastpipe' option does not behave correctly on
    machines where the open file limit is less than 256.
  * Patch 27: When the `extglob' shell option is enabled, pattern
    substitution does not work correctly in the presence of
    multibyte characters.
  * Patch 28: When using a word expansion for which the right hand
    side is evaluated, certain expansions of quoted null strings
    include spurious ^? characters.
  * Patch 29: Bash-4.2 tries to leave completed directory names as
    the user typed them, without expanding them to a full pathname.
    One effect of this is that shell variables used in pathnames
    being completed (e.g., $HOME) are left unchanged, but the `$'
    is quoted by readline because it is a special character to the shell.
  * Patch 30: When attempting to glob strings in a multibyte locale,
    and those strings contain invalid multibyte characters that cause
    mbsnrtowcs to return 0, the globbing code loops infinitely.
  * Patch 31: A change between bash-4.1 and bash-4.2 to prevent the
    readline input hook from being called too frequently had the side
    effect of causing delays when reading pasted input on systems such
    as Mac OS X.  This patch fixes those delays while retaining the
    bash-4.2 behavior.
  * Patch 32: Bash-4.2 has problems with DEL characters in the
    expanded value of variables used in the same quoted string as
    variables that expand to nothing.
  * Patch 33: Bash uses a static buffer when expanding the /dev/fd
    prefix for the test and conditional commands, among other uses,
    when it should use a dynamic buffer to avoid buffer overflow.
  * Patch 34: In bash-4.2, the history code would inappropriately add
    a semicolon to multi-line compound array assignments when adding
    them to the history.
  * Patch 35: When given a number of lines to read, `mapfile -n lines'
    reads one too many.
  * Patch 36: Bash-4.2 produces incorrect word splitting results when
    expanding double-quoted $@ in the same string as and adjacent to
    other variable expansions.  The $@ should be split, the other
    expansions should not.

- Update to bash 4.2 -- changelog see entry for bash 4.2 rc1

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 17 16:19:59 CET 2011 - werner@suse.de

- Update to bash 4.2 rc1
  * `exec -a foo' now sets $0 to `foo' in an executable shell script
    without a leading #!.
  * Subshells begun to execute command substitutions or run shell functions or
    builtins in subshells do not reset trap strings until a new trap is
    specified.  This allows $(trap) to display the caller's traps and the
    trap strings to persist until a new trap is set.
  * `trap -p' will now show signals ignored at shell startup, though their
    disposition still cannot be modified.
  * $'...', echo, and printf understand \uXXXX and \UXXXXXXXX escape sequences.
  * declare/typeset has a new `-g' option, which creates variables in the
    global scope even when run in a shell function.
  * test/[/[[ have a new -v variable unary operator, which returns success if
    `variable' has been set.
  * Posix parsing changes to allow `! time command' and multiple consecutive
    instances of `!' (which toggle) and `time' (which have no cumulative
    effect).
  * Posix change to allow `time' as a command by itself to print the elapsed
    user, system, and real times for the shell and its children.
  * $((...)) is always parsed as an arithmetic expansion first, instead of as
    a potential nested command substitution, as Posix requires.
  * A new FUNCNEST variable to allow the user to control the maximum shell
    function nesting (recursive execution) level.
  * The mapfile builtin now supplies a third argument to the callback command:
    the line about to be assigned to the supplied array index.
  * The printf builtin has a new %(fmt)T specifier, which allows time values
    to use strftime-like formatting.
  * There is a new `compat41' shell option.
  * The cd builtin has a new Posix-mandated `-e' option.
  * Negative subscripts to indexed arrays, previously errors, now are treated
    as offsets from the maximum assigned index + 1.
  * Negative length specifications in the ${var:offset:length} expansion,
    previously errors, are now treated as offsets from the end of the variable.
  * Parsing change to allow `time -p --'.
  * Posix-mode parsing change to not recognize `time' as a keyword if the
    following token begins with a `-'.  This means no more Posix-mode
    `time -p'.  Posix interpretation 267.
  * There is a new `lastpipe' shell option that runs the last command of a
    pipeline in the current shell context.  The lastpipe option has no
    effect if job control is enabled.
  * History expansion no longer expands the `$!' variable expansion.
  * Posix mode shells no longer exit if a variable assignment error occurs
    with an assignment preceding a command that is not a special builtin.
  * History expansion no longer expands the `$!' variable expansion.
  * Posix mode shells no longer exit if a variable assignment error occurs
    with an assignment preceding a command that is not a special builtin.
  * Non-interactive mode shells exit if -u is enabled and an attempt is made
    to use an unset variable with the % or # expansions, the `//', `^', or
    `,' expansions, or the parameter length expansion.
  * Posix-mode shells use the argument passed to `.' as-is if a $PATH search
    fails, effectively searching the current directory.  Posix-2008 change.
- Update to readline 6.2 rc1
  * The history library does not try to write the history filename in the
    current directory if $HOME is unset.  This closes a potential security
    problem if the application does not specify a history filename.
  * New bindable variable `completion-display-width' to set the number of
    columns used when displaying completions.
  * New bindable variable `completion-case-map' to cause case-insensitive
    completion to treat `-' and `_' as identical.
  * There are new bindable vi-mode command names to avoid readline's case-
    insensitive matching not allowing them to be bound separately.
  * New bindable variable `menu-complete-display-prefix' causes the menu
    completion code to display the common prefix of the possible completions
    before cycling through the list, instead of after.

- Update bash 4.1 to patch level 9
  * When declaring an associative array and implicitly assigning a
    value to element "0", bash does not correctly allocate memory,
    leading to a segmentation violation when that element or the
    array itself is unset.
  * An arriving SIGCHLD will interrupt `slow' system calls such as
    write(2) to or read(2) from a terminal.  This results in an
    error message and truncated input or output.

    character (e.g., `*' or `?'), bash can reference a NULL pointer and
    dump core.
  * When running in Posix mode and executing a shell function without local
    variables, bash will not propagate a variable in a special builtin's temporary
    environment to have global scope.
  * When the `read' builtin times out after the timeout specified with -t is
    exceeded, it does not reset the flags that tell signal handlers to process
    signals immediately instead of deferring their handling.  This can result
    in unsafe functions being called from signal handlers, which can cause bash
    to hang or dump core.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb 15 17:24:46 CET 2010 - werner@suse.de

- Update bash 4.1 to patch level 2
  * Here-documents within $(...) command substitutions may once more be
    delimited by the closing right paren, instead of requiring a newline.
  * Bash's file status checks (executable, readable, etc.) now take file
    system ACLs into account on file systems that support them.
  * Bash now passes environment variables with names that are not valid
    shell variable names through into the environment passed to child
    processes.
  * The `execute-unix-command' readline function now attempts to clear and
    reuse the current line rather than move to a new one after the command
    executes.
  * `printf -v' can now assign values to array indices.
  * New `complete -E' and `compopt -E' options that work on the "empty"
    completion: completion attempted on an empty command line.
  * New complete/compgen/compopt -D option to define a `default' completion:
    a completion to be invoked on command for which no completion has been
    defined.  If this function returns 124, programmable completion is
    attempted again, allowing a user to dynamically build a set of completions
    as completion is attempted by having the default completion function
    install individual completion functions each time it is invoked.
  * When displaying associative arrays, subscripts are now quoted.
  * Changes to dabbrev-expand to make it more `emacs-like': no space appended
    after matches, completions are not sorted, and most recent history entries
    are presented first.
  * The [[ and (( commands are now subject to the setting of `set -e' and the
    ERR trap.
  * The source/. builtin now removes NUL bytes from the file before attempting
    to parse commands.
  * There is a new configuration option (in config-top.h) that forces bash to
    forward all history entries to syslog.
  * A new variable $BASHOPTS to export shell options settable using `shopt' to
    child processes.
  * There is a new configure option that forces the extglob option to be
    enabled by default.
  * New variable $BASH_XTRACEFD; when set to an integer bash will write xtrace
    output to that file descriptor.
  * If the optional left-hand-side of a redirection is of the form {var}, the
    shell assigns the file descriptor used to $var or uses $var as the file
    descriptor to move or close, depending on the redirection operator.
  * The < and > operators to the [[ conditional command now do string
    comparison according to the current locale if the compatibility level
    is greater than 40.
  * Programmable completion now uses the completion for `b' instead of `a'
    when completion is attempted on a line like: a $(b c.
  * Force extglob on temporarily when parsing the pattern argument to
    the == and != operators to the [[ command, for compatibility.
  * Changed the behavior of interrupting the wait builtin when a SIGCHLD is
    received and a trap on SIGCHLD is set to be Posix-mode only.
  * The read builtin has a new `-N nchars' option, which reads exactly NCHARS
    characters, ignoring delimiters like newline.
  * The mapfile/readarray builtin no longer stores the commands it invokes via
    callbacks in the history list.
  * There is a new `compat40' shopt option.
- Update readline 6.1 to patch level 1
  * New bindable function: menu-complete-backward.
  * In the vi insertion keymap, C-n is now bound to menu-complete by default,
    and C-p to menu-complete-backward.
  * When in vi command mode, repeatedly hitting ESC now does nothing, even
    when ESC introduces a bound key sequence.  This is closer to how
    historical vi behaves.
  * New bindable function: skip-csi-sequence.  Can be used as a default to
    consume key sequences generated by keys like Home and End without having
    to bind all keys.
  * New application-settable function: rl_filename_rewrite_hook.  Can be used
    to rewrite or modify filenames read from the file system before they are
    compared to the word to be completed.
  * New bindable variable: skip-completed-text, active when completing in the
    middle of a word.  If enabled, it means that characters in the completion
    that match characters in the remainder of the word are "skipped" rather
    than inserted into the line.
  * The pre-readline-6.0 version of menu completion is available as
    "old-menu-complete" for users who do not like the readline-6.0 version.
  * New bindable variable: echo-control-characters.  If enabled, and the
    tty ECHOCTL bit is set, controls the echoing of characters corresponding
    to keyboard-generated signals.
  * New bindable variable: enable-meta-key.  Controls whether or not readline
    sends the smm/rmm sequences if the terminal indicates it has a meta key
    that enables eight-bit characters.
