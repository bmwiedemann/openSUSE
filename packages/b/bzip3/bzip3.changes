Thu Jan  2 16:43:11 UTC 2025 - Andreas Stieger <andreas.stieger@gmx.de>

- update to 1.5.1:
  * Add `--rm` option that removes the original files after
    successful operation
  * `bz3grep`: display the correct program name on invalid
    invocation
  * Tighter LZP/RLE bounds in the decoder for slightly improved
    compression with no observable format change
  * Add the `bz3_min_memory_needed` API.
  * ABI breaking changes: `bz3_decode_block` and `bz3_encode_block`.
  * Fix: the file `$dir.bz3` being created when invoked as
    `bzip3 -e $dir` where `$dir` is a directory.

Mon Dec 18 08:48:39 UTC 2023 - Andrea Manzini <andrea.manzini@suse.com>

- update to 1.4.0:
  * support for linking with C++
  * improvements on CMake build

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug 22 07:15:29 UTC 2023 - Andrea Manzini <andrea.manzini@suse.com>

- update to 1.3.2:
  * Add the `-r` option ("recovery"). If a file fails to decompress fully (e.g. due to a CRC error), ignore it and write the file regardless.
  * Add preliminary CMake support.
  * Fix the include guard macro name to work with pedantic compilers.
  * Fix the shift direction in the crc32 check function. Because of a programming mistake, v1.3.0 and v1.3.1
    introduced a breaking change to the CRC calculation code. The change has been reverted in this release.
    While the archives created with these versions of bzip3 will fail to regularly decompress due to a checksum
    error, using the recovery option as `bzip3 -rd` to decompress will
    restore their original contents.

Fri Jun  2 20:53:07 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.3.1:
  * Verbose mode in the tool now prints the extra statistics also
    during testing, not just encoding or decoding.
  * Update the CI pipeline to Debian Bullseye.
  * Fix a minor issue with side effects in RLE decoding.
  * Explicitly disable `-march=native` for releases.
  * Fix a bug in the tool reported by Adam Borowski regarding
    -t/-d input buffer checks.
  * Fix an issue with the current input offset not being taken
    into account in bz3_compress.
