Mon Nov 28 10:07:47 UTC 2022 - Paolo Stivanin <info@paolostivanin.com>

- Update to 1.7.5:
 * #463: Add "before_actions" and "after_actions" command hooks that run before/after all the
   actions for each repository. These new hooks are a good place to run per-repository steps like
   mounting/unmounting a remote filesystem.
 * #463: Update documentation to cover per-repository configurations:
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/make-per-application-backups/
 * #557: Support for Borg 2 while still working with Borg 1. This includes new borgmatic actions
   like "rcreate" (replaces "init"), "rlist" (list archives in repository), "rinfo" (show repository
   info), and "transfer" (for upgrading Borg repositories). For the most part, borgmatic tries to
   smooth over differences between Borg 1 and 2 to make your upgrade process easier. However, there
   are still a few cases where Borg made breaking changes. See the Borg 2.0 changelog for more
   information: https://www.borgbackup.org/releases/borg-2.0.html
 * #557: If you install Borg 2, you'll need to manually upgrade your existing Borg 1 repositories
   before use. Note that Borg 2 stable is not yet released as of this borgmatic release, so don't
   use Borg 2 for production until it is! See the documentation for more information:
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/upgrade/#upgrading-borg
 * #557: Rename several configuration options to match Borg 2: "remote_rate_limit" is now
   "upload_rate_limit", "numeric_owner" is "numeric_ids", and "bsd_flags" is "flags". borgmatic
   still works with the old options.
 * #557: Remote repository paths without the "ssh://" syntax are deprecated but still supported for
   now. Remote repository paths containing "~" are deprecated in borgmatic and no longer work in
   Borg 2.
 * #557: Omitting the "--archive" flag on the "list" action is deprecated when using Borg 2. Use
   the new "rlist" action instead.
 * #557: The "--dry-run" flag can now be used with the "rcreate"/"init" action.
 * #565: Fix handling of "repository" and "data" consistency checks to prevent invalid Borg flags.
 * #566: Modify "mount" and "extract" actions to require the "--repository" flag when multiple
   repositories are configured.
 * #571: BREAKING: Remove old-style command-line action flags like "--create, "--list", etc. If
   you're already using actions like "create" and "list" instead, this change should not affect you.
 * #571: BREAKING: Rename "--files" flag on "prune" action to "--list", as it lists archives, not
   files.
 * #571: Add "--list" as alias for "--files" flag on "create" and "export-tar" actions.
 * Add support for disabling TLS verification in Healthchecks monitoring hook with "verify_tls"
   option.
 * #381: BREAKING: Greatly simplify configuration file reuse by deep merging when including common
   configuration. See the documentation for more information:
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/make-per-application-backups/#include-merging
 * #473: BREAKING: Instead of executing "before" command hooks before all borgmatic actions run (and
   "after" hooks after), execute these hooks right before/after the corresponding action. E.g.,
   "before_check" now runs immediately before the "check" action. This better supports running
   timing-sensitive tasks like pausing containers. Side effect: before/after command hooks now run
   once for each configured repository instead of once per configuration file. Additionally, the
   "repositories" interpolated variable has been changed to "repository", containing the path to the
   current repository for the hook. See the documentation for more information:
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/add-preparation-and-cleanup-steps-to-backups/
 * #513: Add mention of sudo's "secure_path" option to borgmatic installation documentation.
 * #515: Fix "borgmatic borg key ..." to pass parameters to Borg in the correct order.
 * #516: Fix handling of TERM signal to exit borgmatic, not just forward the signal to Borg.
 * #517: Fix borgmatic exit code (so it's zero) when initial Borg calls fail but later retries
   succeed.
 * Change Healthchecks logs truncation size from 10k bytes to 100k bytes, corresponding to that
   same change on Healthchecks.io.

- update to 1.5.24:
  * #431: Add "working_directory" option to support source directories with relative paths.
  * #444: When loading a configuration file that is unreadable due to file permissions, warn instead
    of erroring. This supports running borgmatic as a non-root user with configuration in ~/.config
    even if there is an unreadable global configuration file in /etc.
  * #469: Add "repositories" context to "before_" and "after_" command action hooks. See the
    documentation for more information:
    https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/add-preparation-and-cleanup-steps-to-backups/
  * #486: Fix handling of "patterns_from" and "exclude_from" options to error instead of warning when
    referencing unreadable files and "create" action is run.
  * #507: Fix Borg usage error in the "compact" action when running "borgmatic --dry-run". Now, skip
    "compact" entirely during a dry run.
  * #394: Compact repository segments and free space with new "borgmatic compact" action. Borg 1.2+
    only. Also run "compact" by default when no actions are specified, as "prune" in Borg 1.2 no
    longer frees up space unless "compact" is run.
  * #394: When using the "atime", "bsd_flags", "numeric_owner", or "remote_rate_limit" options,
    tailor the flags passed to Borg depending on the Borg version.
  * #480, #482: Fix traceback when a YAML validation error occurs.
  * #288: Add database dump hook for MongoDB.
  * #470: Move mysqldump options to the beginning of the command due to MySQL bug 30994.
  * #471: When command-line configuration override produces a parse error, error cleanly instead of
    tracebacking.
  * #476: Fix unicode error when restoring particular MySQL databases.
    Drop support for Python 3.6, which has been end-of-lifed.
    Add support for Python 3.10.

  *  #459: Add support for old version (2.x) of jsonschema library.
  *  #387: Fix error when configured source directories are not present on the filesystem at the time
     of backup. Now, Borg will complain, but the backup will still continue.
  *  #455: Mention changing borgmatic path in cron documentation.
     Update sample systemd service file with more granular read-only filesystem settings.
  *  Move Gitea and GitHub hosting from a personal namespace to an organization for better
     collaboration with related projects.
  *  #389: Fix "message too long" error when logging to rsyslog.
  *  #440: Fix traceback that can occur when dumping a database.

Fri Sep 10 11:30:06 UTC 2021 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- ExcludeArch %ix86: this is a bit a special trick, but as there is
  no pandoc for intel/i586 arch, we can't build there anyway. As
  the resulting package is noarch though, it does not matter much.

  * #327: Fix broken pass-through of BORG_* environment variables
    to Borg.
  * #328: Fix duplicate logging to Healthchecks and send "after_*"
    hooks output to Healthchecks.
  * #331: Add SSL support to PostgreSQL database configuration.

    when borgmatic omitted configured source directories in certain
    situations. Specifically, this occurred when two source
    directories on different filesystems were related by parentage
    (e.g. "/foo" and "/foo/bar/baz") and the one_file_system option
    was enabled.
  * Update documentation code fragments theme to better match the
    rest of the page.
  * Improve configuration reference documentation readability via
    more aggressive word-wrapping in configuration schema
    descriptions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun 15 17:22:18 UTC 2020 - Martin Rey <mrey@suse.com>

- Update to 1.5.6
  * #292: Allow before_backup and similiar hooks to exit with a
    soft failure without altering the monitoring status on
    Healthchecks or other providers. Support this by waiting to
    ping monitoring services with a "start" status until after
    before_* hooks finish. Failures in before_* hooks still trigger
    a monitoring "fail" status.
  * #316: Fix hang when a stale database dump named pipe from an
    aborted borgmatic run remains on disk.
  * #323: Fix for certain configuration options like ssh_command
    impacting Borg invocations for separate configuration files.
  * #324: Add "borgmatic extract --strip-components" flag to remove

- Update to 1.5.5
  * #314: Fix regression in support for PostgreSQL's "directory" dump format. Unlike other dump
    formats, the "directory" dump format does not stream directly to/from Borg.
  * #315: Fix enabled database hooks to implicitly set one_file_system configuration option to true.
  * This prevents Borg from reading devices like /dev/zero and hanging.
  * #316: Fix hang when streaming a database dump to Borg with implicit duplicate source directories
    by deduplicating them first.
  * #319: Fix error message when there are no MySQL databases to dump for "all" databases.
  * Improve documentation around the installation process. Specifically, making borgmatic commands
    runnable via the system PATH and offering a global install option.
- Update to 1.5.4
  * #310: Fix legitimate database dump command errors (exit code 1) not being treated as errors by
    borgmatic.
  * For database dumps, replace the named pipe on every borgmatic run. This prevent hangs on stale
    pipes left over from previous runs.
  * Fix error handling to handle more edge cases when executing commands.
- Update to 1.5.3
  * #258: Stream database dumps and restores directly to/from Borg without using any additional
    filesystem space. This feature is automatic, and works even on restores from archives made with
    previous versions of borgmatic.
  * #293: Documentation on macOS launchd permissions issues with work-around for Full Disk Access.
  * Remove "borgmatic restore --progress" flag, as it now conflicts with streaming database restores.
- Update to 1.5.2
  * #301: Fix MySQL restore error on "all" database dump by excluding system tables.
  * Fix PostgreSQL restore error on "all" database dump by using "psql" for the restore instead of
    "pg_restore".

- Update to 1.5.1
 * #289: Tired of looking up the latest successful archive name in
   order to pass it to borgmatic actions? Me too. Now you can
   specify "--archive latest" to all actions that accept an archive
   flag.
 * 290: Fix the "--stats" and "--files" flags so that they yield
   output at verbosity 0.
 * Reduce the default verbosity of borgmatic logs sent to
   Healthchecks monitoring hook. Now, it's warnings and errors
   only. You can increase the verbosity via the
   "--monitoring-verbosity" flag.
 * Add security policy documentation in SECURITY.md.

   directory default.
 * #277: Customize Healthchecks log level via borgmatic
   "--monitoring-verbosity" flag.
 * #280: Change "exclude_if_present" option to support multiple
   filenames that indicate a directory should be excluded from
   backups, rather than just a single filename.
 * #284: Backup to a removable drive or intermittent server via
   "soft failure" feature. See the documentation for more
   information:
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/backup-to-a-removable-drive-or-an-intermittent-server/
 * #287: View consistency check progress via "--progress" flag for
   "check" action. For "create" and "prune" actions, no longer list
   files or show detailed stats at any verbosities by default. You
   can opt back in with "--files" or "--stats" flags. For "list"
   and "info" actions, show repository names even at verbosity 0.
