- update to 1.5.24:
  * #431: Add "working_directory" option to support source directories with relative paths.
  * #444: When loading a configuration file that is unreadable due to file permissions, warn instead
    of erroring. This supports running borgmatic as a non-root user with configuration in ~/.config
    even if there is an unreadable global configuration file in /etc.
  * #469: Add "repositories" context to "before_" and "after_" command action hooks. See the
    documentation for more information:
    https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/add-preparation-and-cleanup-steps-to-backups/
  * #486: Fix handling of "patterns_from" and "exclude_from" options to error instead of warning when
    referencing unreadable files and "create" action is run.
  * #507: Fix Borg usage error in the "compact" action when running "borgmatic --dry-run". Now, skip
    "compact" entirely during a dry run.
  * #394: Compact repository segments and free space with new "borgmatic compact" action. Borg 1.2+
    only. Also run "compact" by default when no actions are specified, as "prune" in Borg 1.2 no
    longer frees up space unless "compact" is run.
  * #394: When using the "atime", "bsd_flags", "numeric_owner", or "remote_rate_limit" options,
    tailor the flags passed to Borg depending on the Borg version.
  * #480, #482: Fix traceback when a YAML validation error occurs.
  * #288: Add database dump hook for MongoDB.
  * #470: Move mysqldump options to the beginning of the command due to MySQL bug 30994.
  * #471: When command-line configuration override produces a parse error, error cleanly instead of
    tracebacking.
  * #476: Fix unicode error when restoring particular MySQL databases.
    Drop support for Python 3.6, which has been end-of-lifed.
    Add support for Python 3.10.
- avoid bashism in post scripts (bsc#1195391)
- light modernization of spec file

  *  #387: Fix error when configured source directories are not present on the filesystem at the time
     of backup. Now, Borg will complain, but the backup will still continue.
  *  #455: Mention changing borgmatic path in cron documentation.
     Update sample systemd service file with more granular read-only filesystem settings.
  *  Move Gitea and GitHub hosting from a personal namespace to an organization for better
     collaboration with related projects.
  *  #389: Fix "message too long" error when logging to rsyslog.
  *  #440: Fix traceback that can occur when dumping a database.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep 10 11:30:06 UTC 2021 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- ExcludeArch %ix86: this is a bit a special trick, but as there is
  no pandoc for intel/i586 arch, we can't build there anyway. As
  the resulting package is noarch though, it does not matter much.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

    with upgrade-borgmatic-config.
  * #368: Fix signal forwarding from borgmatic to Borg resulting

    non-readable due to directory permissions.

    http://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/monitor-your-backups/

  * #336: Fix for traceback when running Cronitor, Cronhub, and
    PagerDuty monitor hooks.

- Update to 1.5.7
  * #327: Fix broken pass-through of BORG_* environment variables
    to Borg.
  * #328: Fix duplicate logging to Healthchecks and send "after_*"
    hooks output to Healthchecks.
  * #331: Add SSL support to PostgreSQL database configuration.
  * #333: Fix for potential data loss (data not getting backed up)
    when borgmatic omitted configured source directories in certain
    situations. Specifically, this occurred when two source
    directories on different filesystems were related by parentage
    (e.g. "/foo" and "/foo/bar/baz") and the one_file_system option
    was enabled.
  * Update documentation code fragments theme to better match the
    rest of the page.
  * Improve configuration reference documentation readability via
    more aggressive word-wrapping in configuration schema
    descriptions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun 15 17:22:18 UTC 2020 - Martin Rey <mrey@suse.com>

- Update to 1.5.6
  * #292: Allow before_backup and similiar hooks to exit with a
    soft failure without altering the monitoring status on
    Healthchecks or other providers. Support this by waiting to
    ping monitoring services with a "start" status until after
    before_* hooks finish. Failures in before_* hooks still trigger
    a monitoring "fail" status.
  * #316: Fix hang when a stale database dump named pipe from an
    aborted borgmatic run remains on disk.
  * #323: Fix for certain configuration options like ssh_command
    impacting Borg invocations for separate configuration files.
  * #324: Add "borgmatic extract --strip-components" flag to remove

Wed May 27 08:58:21 UTC 2020 - Paolo Stivanin <info@paolostivanin.com>

- Update to 1.5.5
  * #314: Fix regression in support for PostgreSQL's "directory" dump format. Unlike other dump
    formats, the "directory" dump format does not stream directly to/from Borg.
  * #315: Fix enabled database hooks to implicitly set one_file_system configuration option to true.
  * This prevents Borg from reading devices like /dev/zero and hanging.
  * #316: Fix hang when streaming a database dump to Borg with implicit duplicate source directories
    by deduplicating them first.
  * #319: Fix error message when there are no MySQL databases to dump for "all" databases.
  * Improve documentation around the installation process. Specifically, making borgmatic commands
    runnable via the system PATH and offering a global install option.
- Update to 1.5.4
  * #310: Fix legitimate database dump command errors (exit code 1) not being treated as errors by
    borgmatic.
  * For database dumps, replace the named pipe on every borgmatic run. This prevent hangs on stale
    pipes left over from previous runs.
  * Fix error handling to handle more edge cases when executing commands.
- Update to 1.5.3
  * #258: Stream database dumps and restores directly to/from Borg without using any additional
    filesystem space. This feature is automatic, and works even on restores from archives made with
    previous versions of borgmatic.
  * #293: Documentation on macOS launchd permissions issues with work-around for Full Disk Access.
  * Remove "borgmatic restore --progress" flag, as it now conflicts with streaming database restores.
- Update to 1.5.2
  * #301: Fix MySQL restore error on "all" database dump by excluding system tables.
  * Fix PostgreSQL restore error on "all" database dump by using "psql" for the restore instead of
    "pg_restore".

   order to pass it to borgmatic actions? Me too. Now you can
   specify "--archive latest" to all actions that accept an archive
   flag.
 * 290: Fix the "--stats" and "--files" flags so that they yield
   output at verbosity 0.
 * Reduce the default verbosity of borgmatic logs sent to
   Healthchecks monitoring hook. Now, it's warnings and errors
   only. You can increase the verbosity via the
   "--monitoring-verbosity" flag.

 * #287: View consistency check progress via "--progress" flag for
   "check" action. For "create" and "prune" actions, no longer list
   files or show detailed stats at any verbosities by default. You
   can opt back in with "--files" or "--stats" flags. For "list"
   and "info" actions, show repository names even at verbosity 0.
