  <title>A CD image format converter from .bin/.cue to .iso/.cdr/.wav</title>
  <description>The bchunk package contains a UNIX/C rewrite of the BinChunker
program. BinChunker converts a CD image in a .bin/.cue format
(sometimes .raw/.cue) into a set of .iso and .cdr/.wav tracks.
The .bin/.cue format is used by some non-UNIX CD-writing
software, but is not supported on most other CD-writing programs.
