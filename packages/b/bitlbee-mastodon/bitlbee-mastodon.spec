%description
This plugin allows Bitlbee to communicate with Mastodon instances.
Mastodon is a free, open-source, decentralized microblogging network.
Bitlbee is an IRC server connecting to various other text messaging
services. You run Bitlbee and connect to it using an IRC client, then
configure Bitlbee to connect to other services, such as a Mastodon
instance where you already have an account. The benefit is that you can
now use any IRC client you want to connect to Mastodon.
