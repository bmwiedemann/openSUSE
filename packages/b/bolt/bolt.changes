Mon Dec  5 12:33:33 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 0.9.4:
  * spec file added and a few metadata fixes, no code change 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug 24 06:07:41 UTC 2022 - Paolo Stivanin <info@paolostivanin.com>

- Update to 0.9.3:
  * Work around a glib fix that changed behavior of the log API where now
    calling `g_log_set_writer_func` results in an hard error, which broke
    the test suite since aforementioned function was indeed called more
    than once. Nothing a level of indirection couldn't fix.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan 28 08:53:51 UTC 2022 - Paolo Stivanin <info@paolostivanin.com>

- Update to 0.9.2
  * This release is compatible with umockdev >= 0.16.3; there was a change in
    umockdev that made our test fail with it, since both our test and umockev
    were trying to create the same directorires. bolt now allows for the dir
    to already exist.
  * The license for `90-bolt.rules` has changed from `GPL-2.1+`, which does
    not exist and was probably was confused with `LGPL-2.1+`, to `GPL 2.0+`.
  * Documentation has been updated and spelling mistakes fixed.
  * Various improvements for continuous integration.
  * The minimum required version of meson has been bumped to 0.46.0.

Update to 0.6

- New Features:
  * pre-boot access control list, aka. BootACL support
	- domains objects are now persistent
	  * new Uid (dbus) / uid (object) property derived from the uuid of the device representing the root switch
	  * sysfs and id attribute will be set/unset on connects and disconnects
	  * domains are now stored in the boltd database
	- domains got the BootACL (dbus) / bootacl (object) property
	  * uuids can be added, removed or set in batch
	  * when domain is online: changes are written to the sysfs boot_acl attribute directly
	  * when domain is offline: changes are written to a journal and then reapplied in order when the domain is connected
	- newly enrolled devices get added to all bootacls of all domains if the policy is BOLT_POLICY_AUTO
	- removed devices get deleted from all bootacls of all domains
	- boltacl domain command will show the bootacl slots and their content
  * boltctl gained the -U, --uuid option, to control how uuids are printed

- Improvements and fixes:
  * Testing
	- boltctl is now included in the tests
  * Bugs and robustness:
	- The device state is verified in Device.Authorize
	- Handle empty 'keys' sysfs device attribute
	- Properly adjust policies when enrolling already authorized devices
	- Fix potential crasher when logging assertions g_return_if_fail
