Update to 0.6

- New Features:
  * pre-boot access control list, aka. BootACL support
	- domains objects are now persistent
	  * new Uid (dbus) / uid (object) property derived from the uuid of the device representing the root switch
	  * sysfs and id attribute will be set/unset on connects and disconnects
	  * domains are now stored in the boltd database
	- domains got the BootACL (dbus) / bootacl (object) property
	  * uuids can be added, removed or set in batch
	  * when domain is online: changes are written to the sysfs boot_acl attribute directly
	  * when domain is offline: changes are written to a journal and then reapplied in order when the domain is connected
	- newly enrolled devices get added to all bootacls of all domains if the policy is BOLT_POLICY_AUTO
	- removed devices get deleted from all bootacls of all domains
	- boltacl domain command will show the bootacl slots and their content
  * boltctl gained the -U, --uuid option, to control how uuids are printed

- Improvements and fixes:
  * Testing
	- boltctl is now included in the tests
  * Bugs and robustness:
	- The device state is verified in Device.Authorize
	- Handle empty 'keys' sysfs device attribute
	- Properly adjust policies when enrolling already authorized devices
	- Fix potential crasher when logging assertions g_return_if_fail
