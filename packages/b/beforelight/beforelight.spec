%description
The beforelight program is a sample implementation of a screen saver
for X servers supporting the MIT-SCREEN-SAVER extension. It is only
recommended for use as a code sample, as it does not include features
such as screen locking or configurability, and relies on the legacy Xaw
toolkit.
