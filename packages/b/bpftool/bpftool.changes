Wed Oct 30 15:56:21 UTC 2024 - Fredrik Lönnegren <fredrik.lonnegren@suse.com>

- Update to version 7.5.0
  * Add support for attaching and detaching tcx programs with bpftool net,
    along with relevant documentation and bash completion.
  * When dumping BTF information, support dumping kfunc prototypes. Users
    willing to use kfunc no longer have to define the prototypes themselves,
    then can use the generated header file. This is also convenient to check
    what kfuncs are available in the running kernel.
  * Sort the output from the dump, in C format, of BTF objects. Sorting the
    output helps applying diff tools on the generated header files, and helps
    generate a more natural ordering in the header.
  * Print richer information when dumping sockmap links.
  * In BPF skeletons, auto-attach struct_ops BPF maps as part of
    <skeleton>__attach(), define BPF_SKEL_SUPPORTS_MAP_AUTO_ATTACH accordingly.
  * Improvements in libbpf bring the ability to open and work with object files
    in either endianness for some operations like object linking or light BPF
    skeleton creation.
  * Bpftool automatically mounts the BPF virtual file system (bpffs) when
    necessary, for example to pin programs. This bpffs was mounted on the
    parent directory for the provided path under certain circumstances. Now
    bpftool mounts the bpffs on the provided path instead, as expected.
  * When loading programs and trying to pin the maps, attempt to mount the
    bpffs when the provided path for the maps is not under an existing bpffs
    already, as bpftool usually does for other similar commands.
  * Use __typeof__() rather than typeof() in BPF skeleton, to improve
    compatibility with C++.
  * Fix cgroup-related queries to avoid trying to dump (inaccessible)
    Netkit-related information.
  * Fix backward compatibility issue related to struct_ops maps handling for
    BPF skeletons used with older versions of libbpf.
  * Many trivial improvements to bpftool's documentation and bash completion,
    such as formatting fixes, typo fixes, or minor clarifications.
  * Fix typos in error message and usage help message.

Wed May 22 09:43:32 UTC 2024 - Shung-Hsi Yu <shung-hsi.yu@suse.com>

- Update LLVM version selection logic to align with bcc and bpftrace
  * narrow down the dependency to clang and llvm

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 11 07:02:33 UTC 2024 - Fredrik Lönnegren <fredrik.lonnegren@suse.com>

- Update to version 7.4.0
  * Kernel configuration options related to bpfilter (namely: CONFIG_BPFILTER
  * and CONFIG_BPFILTER_UMH) are no longer checked with bpftool feature probe
  * More information displayed for BPF links
  * Generate shadow variables for struct_ops maps in program skeletons
  * Mark orphaned programs as such when listing programs
  * Recognize arena map types (a09e203) and global variables
  * Support the addr_space_cast instruction in the disassembler for translated
    programs
  * In the mirror repository, fix the detection of clang-bpf-co-re (for
    skeletons support) for some clang versions
  * Displaying PIDs for processes holding references to BPF links when listing
    links with bpftool link list on older kernels broke in v7.3.0, because the
    internal program pid_iter would fail to load

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov 28 07:24:46 UTC 2023 - Shung-Hsi Yu <shung-hsi.yu@suse.com>

- Update to version 7.3.0
  * deprecate keyword "dev" for specifying interface name, use
    offload_dev instead
  * support passing an interface name with xdpmeta_dev <ifname>
    with "prog load"
  * show more details information when displaying BPF links
  * show netfilter, tcx, and netkit information in the "net list"
  * support cgroup UNIX socket attach points
  * show inner map IDs (instead of raw values) with "map dump"
  * support LLVM's v4 instructions in the disassembler
  * fix JIT compiler global memory limit report for unprivileged
    users on aarch64
- Remove backported patches that have been included in v7.3.0
  * drop 0001-bpftool-use-a-local-copy-of-perf_event-to-fix-access.patch
  * drop 0002-bpftool-define-a-local-bpf_perf_link-to-fix-accessin.patch
  * drop 0003-bpftool-use-a-local-bpf_perf_event_value-to-fix-acce.patch

Wed Feb 15 09:11:12 UTC 2023 - Martin Liška <mliska@suse.cz>

- Add binutils-2.40.patch where we need to explicitly link against
  -lsframe. It's a workaround for an existing issue:
  https://github.com/libbpf/bpftool/issues/73.
