%description
BYACC/J is an extension of the Berkeley v 1.8 YACC-compatible parser
generator. Standard YACC takes a YACC source file, and generates one or
more C files from it, which if compiled properly, will produce a
LALR-grammar parser. This is useful for expression parsing, interactive
command parsing, and file reading. Many megabytes of YACC code have
been written over the years. This is the standard YACC tool that is in
use every day to produce C/C++ parsers. I have added a "-J" flag which
will cause BYACC to generate Java source code, instead. So there
finally is a YACC for Java now!
