- Update to version 1.5.5:
  * b3sum --check now supports checkfiles with Windows-style
    newlines. b3sum still emits Unix-style newlines, even on
    Windows, but sometimes text editors or version control tools
    will swap them.
  * The "digest" feature (deleted in v1.5.2) has been added back to
    the blake3 crate. This is for backwards compatibility only, and
    it's insta-deprecated. All callers should prefer the
    "traits-preview" feature.

- Update to version 1.5.4:
  * Initial implementation of SIMD acceleration for the XOF (i.e.
    blake3::Hasher::finalize_xof). This brings long output
    performance into line with long input performance. Currently
    AVX-512-only and Unix-only.
  * The "zeroize" feature no longer depends on proc-macros and syn.

- Update to version 1.5.3:
  * Revert the serialization change. It was intended to be
    backwards compatible, but that didn't hold for
    non-self-describing serialization formats like bincode.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul 12 18:31:22 UTC 2024 - Joshua Smith <smolsheep@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 1.5.2:
  * build.rs sets cc::Build::emit_rerun_if_env_changed(false) to
    prevent some unnecessary rebuilds
  * Serializing a Hash produces a bytestring instead of an array in
    formats that support bytestrings (like CBOR). Deserialization
    is backwards-compatible with the array format
  * Cleanup and edge case fixes in the C and CMake builds.

- Package changes:
  * Swap from obsolete tar_scm to obs_scm
  * Remove obsolete cargo_audit (now part of cargo_vendor)
  * Enable tests
- Update to version 1.5.1:
  * The Rust crate is now compatible with Miri.
  * ~1% performance improvement on Arm NEON
  * Various fixes and improvements in the CMake build.
  * The MSRV of b3sum is now 1.74.1. (The MSRV of the library crate
    is unchanged, 1.66.1.)

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- Update to version 1.5.0:
  * The Rust crate's Hasher type has gained new helper methods
    for common forms of IO: update_reader, update_mmap, and
    update_mmap_rayon. The latter matches the default behavior
    of b3sum. The mmap methods are gated by the new "mmap" Cargo
    feature.
  * Most of the Rust crate's public types now implement the Zeroize
    trait. This is gated by the new "zeroize" Cargo feature.
  * The Rust crate's Hash types now implements the serde Serialize
    and Deserialize traits. This is gated by the new "serde" Cargo
    feature.
  * NEON support is now disabled by default on big-endian AArch64.
    Previously this was a build error if the caller didn't
    explicitly disable it.
