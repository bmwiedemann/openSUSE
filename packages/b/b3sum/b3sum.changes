- Update to version 1.5.0:
  * The Rust crate's Hasher type has gained new helper methods
    for common forms of IO: update_reader, update_mmap, and
    update_mmap_rayon. The latter matches the default behavior
    of b3sum. The mmap methods are gated by the new "mmap" Cargo
    feature.
  * Most of the Rust crate's public types now implement the Zeroize
    trait. This is gated by the new "zeroize" Cargo feature.
  * The Rust crate's Hash types now implements the serde Serialize
    and Deserialize traits. This is gated by the new "serde" Cargo
    feature.
  * NEON support is now disabled by default on big-endian AArch64.
    Previously this was a build error if the caller didn't
    explicitly disable it.
