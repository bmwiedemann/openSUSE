- update spec file to use release source tarball
- update to version 1.8.3
  * Add Hash::as_slice.
  * Update to the 2024 Edition and bump the MSRV to 1.85.
  * Fix a set of Miri failures in the intrinsics implementations. We were
     computing (though not dereferencing) an out-of-bounds pointer using
     add rather than wrapping_add. I'm not aware of any observable
     consequences of this bug. See #507.
  * CPU feature detection on x86/x86-64 no longer requires the std Cargo
     feature in the blake3 crate.
  * Build fixes in the C implementation for macOS and Cygwin, and various
  *  improvements to the CMake build.
- updates from version 1.8.2
  * Fixes to the CMake build, particularly around the new TBB feature.

- Update to version 1.8.1:
  * [CMake] Fix transitive dependencies for TBB when libblake3 is
    built with BLAKE3_USE_TBB=1
- Updates from version 1.8.0:
  * The Rust crate now provides the blake3::hazmat module, which
    replaces the undocumented and now deprecated blake3::guts
    module. This is intended for advanced use cases like Bao and
    Iroh, which need to manipulate chunk and subtree "chaining
    values" directly.
- Updates from version 1.7.0:
  * The C implementation has gained multithreading support, based
    on Intel's oneTBB library. This works similarly to the
    Rayon-based multithreading used in the Rust implementation. See
    c/README.md for details.
  * Added b3sum --tag, which changes the output format. This is for
    compatibility with GNU checksum tools (which use the same flag)
    and BSD checksum tools (which use the output format this flag
    turns on).
- Updates from version 1.6.1:
  * Remove mmap from the default features list. It was added
    accidentally in v1.6.0, last week. This is technically a
    backwards-incompatible change, but I would rather not tag
    v2.0.0 for a build-time bugfix with a simple workaround.
- Updates from version 1.6.0:
  * Add Hash::from_slice.

Sat Nov 30 08:47:40 UTC 2024 - Joshua Smith <smolsheep@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 1.5.5:
  * b3sum --check now supports checkfiles with Windows-style
    newlines. b3sum still emits Unix-style newlines, even on
    Windows, but sometimes text editors or version control tools
    will swap them.
  * The "digest" feature (deleted in v1.5.2) has been added back to
    the blake3 crate. This is for backwards compatibility only, and
    it's insta-deprecated. All callers should prefer the
    "traits-preview" feature.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 19 19:13:34 UTC 2024 - Joshua Smith <smolsheep@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 1.5.4:
  * Initial implementation of SIMD acceleration for the XOF (i.e.
    blake3::Hasher::finalize_xof). This brings long output
    performance into line with long input performance. Currently
    AVX-512-only and Unix-only.
  * The "zeroize" feature no longer depends on proc-macros and syn.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul 18 01:35:13 UTC 2024 - Joshua Smith <smolsheep@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 1.5.3:
  * Revert the serialization change. It was intended to be
    backwards compatible, but that didn't hold for
    non-self-describing serialization formats like bincode.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul 12 18:31:22 UTC 2024 - Joshua Smith <smolsheep@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 1.5.2:
  * build.rs sets cc::Build::emit_rerun_if_env_changed(false) to
    prevent some unnecessary rebuilds
  * Serializing a Hash produces a bytestring instead of an array in
    formats that support bytestrings (like CBOR). Deserialization
    is backwards-compatible with the array format
  * Cleanup and edge case fixes in the C and CMake builds.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr 22 14:37:02 UTC 2024 - Joshua Smith <smolsheep@opensuse.org>

- Package changes:
  * Swap from obsolete tar_scm to obs_scm
  * Remove obsolete cargo_audit (now part of cargo_vendor)
  * Enable tests
- Update to version 1.5.1:
  * The Rust crate is now compatible with Miri.
  * ~1% performance improvement on Arm NEON
  * Various fixes and improvements in the CMake build.
  * The MSRV of b3sum is now 1.74.1. (The MSRV of the library crate
    is unchanged, 1.66.1.)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Dec 31 09:06:17 UTC 2023 - Joshua Smith <jsmithfpv@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.5.0:
  * The Rust crate's Hasher type has gained new helper methods
    for common forms of IO: update_reader, update_mmap, and
    update_mmap_rayon. The latter matches the default behavior
    of b3sum. The mmap methods are gated by the new "mmap" Cargo
    feature.
  * Most of the Rust crate's public types now implement the Zeroize
    trait. This is gated by the new "zeroize" Cargo feature.
  * The Rust crate's Hash types now implements the serde Serialize
    and Deserialize traits. This is gated by the new "serde" Cargo
    feature.
  * NEON support is now disabled by default on big-endian AArch64.
    Previously this was a build error if the caller didn't
    explicitly disable it.
