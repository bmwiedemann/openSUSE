Subject: [PATCH] bcache-tools: improve is_zoned_device()
Git-commit: a5e3753516bd39c431def86c8dfec8a9cea1ddd4
References: bsc#1208425

To check whether a block device is zoned or not, is_zoned_device()
returns true when /sys/block/<device>/queue/chunk_sectors is not zero.

Now there are devices which are not zoned devices but has non-zero
chunk-sectors values. For such situation, the more accurate method is
to read file /sys/block/<device>/queue/zoned. If the content is not
string "none", this device is not a zoned device. Otherwise (e.g.
"host-aware" or "host- managed"), it is a zoned device.

For elder kernel if the above sysfs file doesn't exist, get_zone_size()
is still called by is_zoned_device() for compatibility.
