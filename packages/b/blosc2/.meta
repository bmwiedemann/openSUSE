  <title>A blocking, shuffling and lossless compression library</title>
  <description>Blosc is a compressor for binary data, designed to transmit data to
the processor cache faster than the traditional, non-compressed,
direct memory fetch approach via a memcpy() call. Blosc is not only a
compressor for data size reduction, but also for accelerating
memory-bound computations.

It uses the blocking technique to reduce activity on the memory bus,
which works by dividing datasets in blocks that are small enough to
fit in caches of processors and perform (de)compression there. SIMD
and multi-threading capabilities are leveraged if available.

Blosc is a metacompressor; it can use different compression
algorithms, such as BloscLZ, LZ4, LZ4HC, Snappy and Zlib.
