- Update to 2.10.2
  * Several fixes for the CMake system. Thanks to Axel Huebl. See
    PR #541 and #542.
- Changes from 2.10.0 to 2.10.1
  * blosc2_remove_urlpath(const char *urlpath) does not return an
    error when path does not exist.
  * Changes in CMake installer to conserve targets and properties
    on install, so CMake users do not need to write
    FindBlosc2.cmake files anymore. This also helps to preserve
    transitive dependencies on CMake targets, especially useful for
    fully static builds, e.g., for Python wheels. Thanks to @ax3l
    (Axel Huebl). See PR #537.
  * Fix new typos. Thanks to @DimitriPapadopoulos. See PR #538.
- Changes from 2.9.3 to 2.10.0
  * bytedelta filter has been fixed. For backward compatibility,
    the old bytedelta filter is still available as
    BLOSC_FILTER_BYTEDELTA_BUGGY symbol, with the same ID (34) than
    before. The new, fixed bytedelta filter has received a new ID
    (35) and it can be used via the usual BLOSC_FILTER_BYTEDELTA
    symbol. That means that old data written with the buggy
    bytedelta filter should be decompressed without issues. Thanks
    to @foody (Tom Birch) for the fix. See #531, #532 for more
    info.
  * Filter buffers are correctly cycled now. Now it is possible to
    use e.g. shuffle and bitshuffle filters in the pipeline. Thanks
    to @foody (Tom Birch) for the fix. See #528 and PR #530.
  * Assorted fixes for allowing better inclusion in external
    projects. Thanks to @ax3l (Axel Huebel). See #525, #527 and
    #529.
- Changes from 2.9.2 to 2.9.3
  * Thanks to Dimitri Papadopoulos for an extensive set of
    improvements in documentation and code.
  * load_lib is now a private function. Before was public, but
    never meant to be.
  * Several fixes for bugs discovered by the fuzzer.
- Changes from 2.9.1 to 2.9.2
  * Now is possible to register the same plugin (as long as they
    have the same ID and name) without errors. This is useful for
    registering the same plugin without worrying on whether it has
    been registered already.
  * Improved detection of dynamic plugin locations. Now they must
    implement plugin_module.print_libpath() as the canonical way to
    find the path for the dynamic library plugin.
  * The blosc2_static has gained the cmake
    POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE property. This should allow to use
    the static library in more situations.
  * BLOSC_STUNE is defined in blosc2.h now. Fixes #481. Thanks to
    @DimitriPapadopoulos.
  * Fixed an issue when having incompressible data in combination
    with lazy_chunks.
  * Fix linking with static -DBUILD_STATIC=0. Fixes #480.
  * Many small fixes and code improvements. Thanks to
    @DimitriPapadopoulos, @bnavigator.

- Update to 2.9.1
  * Allow the use of BTUNE by detecting the ``BTUNE_BALANCE``
    environment variable.
- Release 2.9.0
  * Dynamic plugins as Python wheels are supported now! This new
    feature allows for creating plugins in C, distribute them as
    wheels, and load them dynamically in runtime. Small example at
    https://github.com/Blosc/blosc2_plugin_example
  * BloscLZ can achieve more speed in clevel 1 now.
  * Internal Zstd sources updated to latest 1.5.5 version.
  * Copyright notice updated.  Thanks to @DimitriPapadopoulos.

- Update to 2.8.0
  * New bytedelta filter added. SIMD support for Intel and ARM platforms is there.
    We have blogged about this: https://www.blosc.org/posts/bytedelta-enhance-compression-toolset
    Thanks to Aras Pranckevičius for inspiration and initial implementation.
  * Minor improvements in BloscLZ, leading to better compression ratios in general.
  * BLoscLZ version bumped to 2.5.2.
  * Updated internal zlib-ng to 2.0.7.

- Update to 2.7.1
  * Caterva has been merged and carefully integrated in C-Blosc2 in
    the new b2nd interface. For more info on the new interface, see
    https://www.blosc.org/c-blosc2/reference/b2nd.html. Thanks to
    Marta Iborra, Oscar Guiñón, J. David Ibáñez and Francesc Alted.
    Also thanks to Aleix Alcacer for his great work in the Caterva
    project. We have a blog about this:
    https://www.blosc.org/posts/blosc2-ndim-intro
  * Updated internal zstd sources to 1.5.4. Thanks to Dimitri
    Papadopoulos.
  * blosc2_schunk_avoid_cframe_free and blosc2_schunk_append_file
    are exported as public functions now. Thanks to @bnavigator.
  * BloscLZ codec is now treated exactly the same as LZ4. Before
    BloscLZ was considered less capable of reaching decent
    compression ratios, but this has changed quite a bit lately, so
    there is no point in treating both differently.
  * Fixed some leaks, mainly on the test suite.
  * Fixed quite a bit of compiler warnings.
