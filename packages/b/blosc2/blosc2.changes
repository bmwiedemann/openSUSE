- Update to 2.7.1
  * Caterva has been merged and carefully integrated in C-Blosc2 in
    the new b2nd interface. For more info on the new interface, see
    https://www.blosc.org/c-blosc2/reference/b2nd.html. Thanks to
    Marta Iborra, Oscar Gui침칩n, J. David Ib치침ez and Francesc Alted.
    Also thanks to Aleix Alcacer for his great work in the Caterva
    project. We have a blog about this:
    https://www.blosc.org/posts/blosc2-ndim-intro
  * Updated internal zstd sources to 1.5.4. Thanks to Dimitri
    Papadopoulos.
  * blosc2_schunk_avoid_cframe_free and blosc2_schunk_append_file
    are exported as public functions now. Thanks to @bnavigator.
  * BloscLZ codec is now treated exactly the same as LZ4. Before
    BloscLZ was considered less capable of reaching decent
    compression ratios, but this has changed quite a bit lately, so
    there is no point in treating both differently.
  * Fixed some leaks, mainly on the test suite.
  * Fixed quite a bit of compiler warnings.
 - Drop blosc2-export-schunk.patch
