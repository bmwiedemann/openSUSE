  <description>Tools to generate block map (AKA bmap) and flash images using bmap. Bmaptool is
a generic tool for creating the block map (bmap) for a file, and copying files
using the block map. The idea is that large file containing unused blocks, like
raw system image files, can be copied or flashed a lot faster with bmaptool
than with traditional tools like &quot;dd&quot; or &quot;cp&quot;.</description>
