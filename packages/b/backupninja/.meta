  <title>Lightweight, extensible meta-backup system</title>
  <description>Backupninja allows you to coordinate system backup by dropping a few simple configuration files into /etc/backup.d/. Most programs you might use for making backups don't have their own configuration file format. Backupninja provides a centralized way to configure and coordinate many different backup utilities.

The key features of backupninja are:

- easy to read ini style configuration files
- you can drop in scripts to handle new types of backups
- backup actions can be scheduled
- you can choose when status report emails are mailed to you (always, on warning, on error, never)
- console-based wizard (ninjahelper) makes it easy to create backup action configuration files
- passwords are never sent via the command line to helper programs</description>
