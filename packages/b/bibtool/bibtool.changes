- Fix escaping of commented out patch: with RPM 4.20, %patch
  becomes a standard, expandable macro, that can span more than one
  line. Commenting out with #%patch can thus lead to invalid
  results.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb 22 10:12:09 UTC 2024 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Use %patch -P N instead of deprecated %patchN (all patches
  disabled, scripted change).

- Update to version 2.68 
  * Handling of extracting by aux file improved.
  * Record extended by attribute lineno.This attribute carries
    the line number of the initiating @.
  * The format of the error messages has been slightly
    streamlined. Double spaces are avoided; two colons in one
    message are avoided.
  * The format of the messages of check_rule include file and
    line number.
  * Warning for double fields added.
  * The empty output file is used to signal that the output
    should be suppressed.
  * The resources check.warning.rule and check.error.rule have
    been introduced to allow semantic checks to be classified
    as warning or error.
  * The behaviour of the resource check.double has been
    generalized. The requirement that double entries to be
    adjacent has been dropped. This has the impact that the
    processing is slightly slower.
  * New resource file unique.field introduced. With this
    resource it is possible to specify additional unique
    constraints for fields. If different records have the same
    value for one of those fields then a warning is issued.
  * Static library renamed from libbib.a to libbibtool.a.
