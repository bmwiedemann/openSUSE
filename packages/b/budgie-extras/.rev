    <comment>- Update to version 1.4.0 &quot;Budgie Bonanza&quot;
  * Budgie Applications Menu applet: this has the following
    enhancements from upstream:
    * App context menu available when right click from search
      results.
    * Reads the PrefersNonDefaultGPU setting from .desktop files
      and uses that to automatically configure default or
      non-default GPU.
    * Adds a new context menu to support choosing the other GPU
    * Categories have been slimmed down - less apps should
      default to the “Other” category.
    * when searching, Nemo bookmarks are also displayed in the
      search results.
  * Applications menu category view now defaults to 6px which
    gives a less squashed look for most themes - this can be
    configured via the applet settings.
  * Quicknote pop-up correctly retains its scroll-position so
    no need to keep scrolling up and down to find text you
    previously was looking at.
  * Made Shuffler more robust, handling situations when a window
    was just closed before a shuffler action was performed on it,
    or when trying to perform an action on a window of an
    invalid window type (e.g. a dialog window).
  * Budgie Previews, Budgie Quickchar and Budgie Window Shuffler
    now appear in GNOME-Software with meaningful descriptions
    and pictures.
  * Shuffle windows according to which is the active monitor.
  * Shuffle Control window animations match Budgie Settings'
    cross-fade.
  * Fix Shuffler rules to check window type
    (so e.g. dialog windows won't be positioned).
  * Dropby handle MMC (SD Cards) as well as USB.
  * Add ChromeOS based layout.
  * Update default Ubuntu Budgie layout.
  * Add delay option for Hot-corners; useful for touchpads that
    have difficulty measuring speed of movement.
  * Lots and lots of translations.
  * Handle terminating secondary processes more gracefully,
    when applets are removed from the panel .
  * Removed Window Mover applet since no longer supported.
  * Removed Workspace Overview applet since no longer supported.
  * Ejecting from Dropby is managed with modern API.
  * Fixed Dropby popup timing.
  * Replaced deprecated Notify2 based notifications with
    notify-send.
  * Desktop file icons moved to the recommended hicolor icon folder
    location.
  * Fixed missing QuickChar icon; new icon designed.
  * Network applet settings now opens in budgie-control-center
    if installed.
  * Network applet spinner icon handled correctly when
    connecting to VPNs.
  * Network applet settings now opens in budgie-control-center
    if installed.
  * Changed from ChangeLog to NEWS file for version history.
- Removed python3-shebangs.patch: replaced with sed command
