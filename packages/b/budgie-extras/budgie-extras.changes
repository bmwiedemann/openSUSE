- Update to version 1.4.0 "Budgie Bonanza"
  * Budgie Applications Menu applet: this has the following
    enhancements from upstream:
    * App context menu available when right click from search
      results.
    * Reads the PrefersNonDefaultGPU setting from .desktop files
      and uses that to automatically configure default or
      non-default GPU.
    * Adds a new context menu to support choosing the other GPU
    * Categories have been slimmed down - less apps should
      default to the “Other” category.
    * when searching, Nemo bookmarks are also displayed in the
      search results.
  * Applications menu category view now defaults to 6px which
    gives a less squashed look for most themes - this can be
    configured via the applet settings.

    no need to keep scrolling up and down to find text you
    previously was looking at.
  * Made Shuffler more robust, handling situations when a window
