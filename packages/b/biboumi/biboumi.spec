%description
Biboumi is an XMPP gateway that connects to IRC servers and
translates between the two protocols. XMPP users can take part in IRC
discussions, using their favourite XMPP client.

It provides the following features:

 * Connection from an unlimited number of XMPP users to an unlimited number of IRC servers
 * Persistent connections to a configured list of channels, making it behave as an IRC bouncer
 * Basic channel features: join, part, view and set the topic, view and set channel or user modes, kick, nick change…
 * Private conversations
 * Notices
 * Invitations
 * IRC colors (receive only)
 * TLS connections to IRC servers
 * Channel listing
 * CTCP version and ping
 * Dynamic per-user, per-server configuration using XMPP ad-hoc commands and data-forms
 * Automatic sending of a command on connection (mostly used to send an identify message to NickServ or other authentication services)
 * Support for sending arbitrary IRC commands to a server
 * Embedded identd server
 * Message Archive Management support
