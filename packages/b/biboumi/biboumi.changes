Sun Apr 18 15:18:25 UTC 2021 - Ferdinand Thiessen <rpm@fthiessen.de>

- Update to 9.0:
  * Messages reflections are now properly cut if the body was cut
    befor being to sent to IRC
  * Messages from unjoined resources are now rejected instead of
    being accepted.
  * All commands sent to IRC servers are now throttled to avoid
    being disconnected for excess flood. The limit value can be
    customized using the ad-hoc configuration form on a server JID.
  * Support for XEP-0410 Self-Ping Optimization.
  * SASL support has been added.
  * SIGHUP is now caught and reloads the configuration like
    SIGUSR1 and 2.
  * Add a verify_certificate policy option that lets the admin
    disable certificate validation per-domain.
  * The WatchdogSec value in the biboumi.service file
    now defaults to the empty string, which means “disabled”.
- Added do-not-require-git.patch, use system Catch2
- Enable tests

Fri Jun  1 22:43:35 UTC 2018 - benedikt@g5r.eu

- Update to biboumi 8.3

  Changes in version 8.3
  * The global ad-hoc configure command is now available on biboumi’s JID in
  fixed_irc_server mode.

  Changes in version 8.2
  * The users are not able to bypass the fixed mode by just configuring a
  different Address for the IRC server anymore.

  Changes in version 8.1
  * Fix a crash on a raw NAMES command

  Changes in version 8.0
  * GCC 4.9 or lower are not supported anymore. The minimal version is 5.0
  * Add a complete='true' in MAM’s iq result when appropriate
  * The archive ordering now only relies on the value of the ID, not the
  date. This means that if you manually import archives in your database (or
          mess with it somehow), biboumi will not work properly anymore, if you
  don’t make sure the ID of everything in the muclogline table is
  consistent.
  * The “virtual” channel with an empty name (for example
          %irc.freenode.net@biboumi) has been entirely removed.
  * Add an “Address” field in the servers’ configure form. This lets
  the user customize the address to use when connecting to a server.
  See https://lab.louiz.org/louiz/biboumi/issues/3273 for more details.
  * Messages id are properly reflected to the sender
  * We now properly deal with a PostgreSQL server restart: whenever the
  connection is lost with the server, we try to reconnect and re-execute the
  query once.
  * A Nick field has been added in the IRC server configuration form, to let
  the user force a nickname whenever a channel on the server is joined.
  * Multiple admins can now be listed in the admin field, separated with a colon.
  * Missing fields in a data-form response are now properly interpreted as
  an empty value, and not the default value. Gajim users were not able to
  empty a field of type text-multi because of this issue.
  * Fix an uncaught exception with botan, when policy does not allow any
  available ciphersuite.
  * When the connection gets desynchronized and tries to re-join while
  biboumi thinks it has never left, biboumi now sends the whole standard
  join sequence (history, user-list, etc).
