%description
Gazelle is a generator of Bazel build files for Go projects. It can create new
BUILD.bazel files for a project that follows "go build" conventions, and it can
update existing build files to include new sources, dependencies, and options.
Gazelle may be run by Bazel using the gazelle rule, or it can be run as a
command line tool. Gazelle can also be run in an external repository as part of
the go_repository rule. Gazelle may be extended to support new languages and
custom rule sets.
