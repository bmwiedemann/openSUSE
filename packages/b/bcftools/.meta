  <title>Tools for manipulating variant calls in the Variant Call Format (VCF)</title>
  <description>Package for the new BCFtools: a set of utilities that manipulate variant calls in the Variant Call Format (VCF) and its binary counterpart BCF. It contains all the &quot;vcf...&quot; commands which previously lived in the HTSlib repository (such as vcfcheck, vcfmerge, vcfisec, etc.) and the samtools BCF calling from bcftools subdirectory of samtools. BCFtools are meant as a faster replacement for most of the perl VCFtools commands.</description>
