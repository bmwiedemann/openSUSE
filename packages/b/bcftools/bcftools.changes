    VCF tag names by the specification couldn't be queried.
- Update to version 1.15
  * New bcftools head subcommand for conveniently displaying the
    headers of a VCF or BCF file.
  * The -T, --targets-file option had the following bug originating
    in HTSlib code
  * bcftools annotate:
    * In addition to --rename-annots, which requires a file with
      name mappings, it is now possible to do the same on the
      command line -c NEW_TAG:=OLD_TAG
    * Add new option --min-overlap which allows to specify the
      minimum required overlap of intersecting regions
    * Allow to transfer ALT from VCF with or without replacement
  * bcftools convert:
    * Revamp of --gensample, --hapsample and --haplegendsample
      family of options
    * New --3N6 option to output/input the new version of the .gen

    * bug fix, FORMAT/BCSQ bitmasks could have been assigned incorrectly
      to some samples at multiallelic sites, a superset of the correct
      consequences would have been set
    * bug fix, the upstream stop could be falsely assigned to all samples
      in a multi-sample VCF even if the stop was relevant for a single
      sample only

    * Support for matching annotation line by ID, in addition to
      CHROM,POS,REF, and ALT
  * bcftools csq:
    * When GFF and VCF/fasta use a different chromosome naming convention
      no consequences would be added.
    * Parametrize brief-predictions parameter to allow explicit number
      of amino acids to be printed.

    * Fix bug in VAF calculation, homozygous de novo variants were
      incorrectly reported as having VAF=50%
    * Fix arithmetic underflow which could lead to imprecise scores
      and improve sensitivity in high coverage regions
    * Allow combining --pn and --pns to set the noise thresholds independently
- Rebased use_python3.patch
- Drop python3 and perl build requirements, not needed, shbang of
  executables can be patched anyway.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May 14 10:42:08 UTC 2021 - Ferdinand Thiessen <rpm@fthiessen.de>

- Update to version 1.12
  * The output file type is determined from the output file name
    suffix, where available, so the -O/--output-type option is often
    no longer necessary.
  * Make F_MISSING in filtering expressions work for sites with
    multiple ALT alleles
  * Fix N_PASS and F_PASS to behave according to expectation when
    reverse logic is used (#1397). This fix has the side effect of
    query (or programs like +trio-stats) behaving differently with
    these expressions, operating now in site-oriented rather than
    sample-oriented mode.
  * bcftools annotate:
    * New --rename-annots option to help fix broken VCFs
    * New -C option allows to read a long list of options from a file
      to prevent very long command lines.
    * New append-missing logic allows annotations to be added for
      each ALT allele in the same order as they appear in the VCF.
  * bcftools concat:
    * Do not phase genotypes by mistake if they are not already
      phased with -l
  * bcftools consensus:
    * New --mask-with, --mark-del, --mark-ins, --mark-snv options
    * Symbolic <DEL> should have only one REF base. If there are
      multiple, take POS+1 as the first deleted base.
    * Make consensus work when the first base of the reference genome
      is deleted.
  * bcftools +contrast:
    * The NOVELGT annotation was previously not added when requested.
  * bcftools convert:
    * Make the --hapsample and --hapsample2vcf options consistent with
      each other and with the documentation.
  * bcftools call:
    * Revamp of call -G, previously sample grouping by population was
      not truly independent and could still be influenced by the
      presence of other sample groups.
    * Optional addition of INFO/PV4 annotation with call -a INFO/PV4
    * Remove generation of useless HOB and ICB annotation;
      use +fill-tags -- -t HWE,ExcHet instead
    * The call -f option was renamed to -a to (1) make it consistent
      with mpileup and (2) to indicate that it includes both INFO and
      FORMAT annotations
  * bcftools csq:
    * Fix a bug wich caused incorrect FORMAT/BCSQ formatting at sites
      with too many per-sample consequences
    * Fix a bug which incorrectly handled the --ncsq parameter and
      could clash with reserved BCF values, consequently producing
      truncated or even incorrect output of the %TBCSQ formatting
      expression in bcftools query.
  * bcftools +fill-tags:
    * MAF definition revised for multiallelic sites, the second most
      common allele is considered to be the minor allele
    * New FORMAT/VAF, VAF1 annotations to set the fraction of
      alternate reads provided FORMAT/AD is present
  * bcftools gtcheck:
    * support matching of a single sample against all other samples
      in the file with -s qry:sample -s gt:-.
  * bcftools merge:
    * Make merge -R behavior consistent with other commands and pull
      in overlapping records with POS outside of the regions
    * Bug fix
  * bcftools mpileup:
    * Add new optional tag mpileup -a FORMAT/QS
  * bcftools norm:
    * New -a, --atomize functionality to decompose complex variants,
      for example MNVs into consecutive SNVs
    * New option --old-rec-tag to indicate the original variant
  * bcftools query:
    * Incorrect fields were printed in the per-sample output when
      subset of samples was requested via -s/-S and the order of
      samples in the header was different from the requested -s/-S order
  * bcftools +prune:
    * New options --random-seed and --nsites-per-win-mode
  * bcftools +split-vep:
    * Transcript selection now works also on the raw CSQ/BCSQ annotation.
    * Bug fix, samples were dropped on VCF input and VCF/BCF output
  * bcftools stats:
    * Changes to QUAL and ts/tv plotting stats: avoid capping QUAL to
      predefined bins, use an open-range logarithmic binning instead
    * plot dual ts/tv stats: per quality bin and cumulative as if
      threshold applied on the whole dataset
  * bcftools +trio-dnm2:
    * Major revamp of +trio-dnm plugin, which is now deprecated
      and replaced by +trio-dnm2.
    * The original trio-dnm calling model used genotype likelihoods
      (PLs) as the input for calling.
    * This new version also implements the DeNovoGear model.
    * For more details see http://samtools.github.io/bcftools/trio-dnm.pdf

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 13 00:53:30 UTC 2021 - Ferdinand Thiessen <rpm@fthiessen.de>

- Update to version 1.11
  * Breaking change in -i/-e expressions on the FILTER column.
    The new behaviour is:
        Expression 	Result
        FILTER="A" 	Exact match, for example "A;B" does not pass
        FILTER!="A" 	Exact match, for example "A;B" does pass
        FILTER~"A" 	Both "A" and "A;B" pass
        FILTER!~"A" 	Neither "A" nor "A;B" pass
  * Fix in commutative comparison operators, in some cases reversing
    sides would produce incorrect results
  * Better support for filtering on sample subsests
  * bcftools annotate:
    * Previously it was not possible to use --columns =TAG with INFO
      tags and the --merge-logic feature was restricted to tab files
      with BEG,END columns, now extended to work also with REF,ALT.
    * Make annotate -TAG/+TAG work also with FORMAT fields.
    * ID and FILTER can be transferred to INFO and ID can be populated
      from INFO.
  * bcftools consensus:
    * Fix in handling symbolic deletions and overlapping variants.
    * Fix --iupac-codes crash on REF-only positions with ALT=".".
    * Fix --chain crash
    * Preserve the case of the genome reference.

      no supporting evidence to "N" (or any other character).
  * bcftools convert:
    * The option --vcf-ids now works also with -haplegendsample2vcf.
    * New option --keep-duplicates
  * bcftools csq:
    * Add misc/gff2gff.py script for conversion between various
      flavors of GFF files. The initial commit supports only one type
    * Add missing consequence types.
    * Allow overlapping CDS to support ribosomal slippage.
  * bcftools +fill-tags:
    * Added new annotations: INFO/END, TYPE, F_MISSING.
  * bcftools filter:
    * Make --SnpGap optionally filter also SNPs close to other variant
      types.
  * bcftools gtcheck:
    * Complete revamp of the command. The new version is faster and allows
    N:M sample comparisons, not just 1:N or NxN comparisons. Some
    functionality was lost (plotting and clustering) but may be added back
    on popular demand.
  * bcftools +mendelian:
    * Revamp of user options, output VCFs with mendelian errors annotation,
    read PED files
  * bcftools merge:
    * Update headers when appropriate with the '--info-rules *:join'
      INFO rule.
    * Local alleles merging that produce LAA and LPL when requested, a
      draft implementation of samtools/hts-specs#434
    * New --no-index which allows to merge unindexed files.
    * Fixes in gVCF merging.
  * bcftools norm:
    * Fixes in --check-ref s reference setting features with non-ACGT bases.
    * New --keep-sum switch to keep vector sum constant when splitting
      multiallelics.
  * bcftools +prune:
    * Extend to allow annotating with various LD metrics: r^2, Lewontin's D'
  * bcftools query:
    * New %N_PASS() formatting expression to output the number of samples
      that pass the filtering expression.
  * bcftools reheader:
    * Improved error reporting to prevent user mistakes.
  * bcftools roh:
    * The --AF-file description incorrectly suggested "REF\tALT"
      instead of the correct "REF,ALT".
    * RG lines could have negative length.
    * new --include-noalt option to allow also ALT=. records.
  * bcftools scatter:
    * New plugin intended as a convenient inverse to concat
  * bcftools +split:
    * New --groups-file option for more flexibility of defining
      desired output
    * New --hts-opts option to reduce required memory by reusing
      one output
      header and allow overriding the default hFile's block size
    * Add support for multisample output and sample renaming
  * bcftools +split-vep:
    * Add default types (Integer, Float, String) for VEP subfields
      and make --columns - extract all subfields into INFO tags
      in one go.

- Update to 1.10.0
  + Numerous bug fixes, usability improvements and sanity checks were added to prevent common user errors.
  + The -r, --regions (and -R, --regions-file) option should never create unsorted VCFs or duplicates records again. This also fixes rare cases where a spanning deletion makes a subsequent record invisible to bcftools isec and other commands.

  + annotate
    * new -l, --merge-logic option for combining multiple overlapping regions
  + call
    * new bcftools call -G, --group-samples option which allows grouping samples into populations and applying the HWE assumption within but not across the groups.
  + csq
    * significant reduction of memory usage in the local -l mode for VCFs with thousands of samples and 20% reduction in the non-local haplotype-aware mode.

    * do not print protein sequence of start_lost events
    * support for "start_retained" consequence
    * support for symbolic insertions (ALT="<INS...>"), "feature_elongation" consequence
    * new -b, --brief-predictions option to output abbreviated protein predictions.
  + concat
    * the --naive command now checks header compatibility when concatenating multiple files.
  + consensus

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep  6 08:43:05 UTC 2018 - flyos@mailoo.org

- Update to 1.9
    * `annotate`
        - REF and ALT columns can be now transferred from the annotation 
    file.
        - fixed bug when setting vector_end values.
    * `consensus`
        - new -M option to control output at missing genotypes
        - variants immediately following insersions should not be skipped. 
          Note however, that the current fix requires normalized VCF and may 
          still falsely skip variants adjacent to multiallelic indels.
        - bug fixed in -H selection handling
    * `convert`
        - the --tsv2vcf option now makes the missing genotypes diploid, 
          "./." instead of "."
        - the behavior of -i/-e with --gvcf2vcf changed. Previously only 
          sites with FILTER set to "PASS" or "." were expanded and the -i/-e 
          options dropped sites completely. The new behavior is to let the -i/-e 
          options control which records will be expanded. In order to drop 
          records completely, one can stream through "bcftools view" first.
    * `csq`
        - since the real consequence of start/splice events are not known, 
          the aminoacid positions at subsequent variants should stay unchanged
        - add `--force` option to skip malformatted transcripts in GFFs 
          with out-of-phase CDS exons.
    * `+dosage`: output all alleles and all their dosages at multiallelic 
       sites
    * `+fixref`: fix serious bug in -m top conversion
    * `-i/-e` filtering expressions:
        - add two-tailed binomial test
        - add functions N_PASS() and F_PASS()
        - add support for lists of samples in filtering expressions, with 
          many samples it was impractical to list them all on the command line. 
          Samples can be now in a file as, e.g., GT[@samples.txt]="het"
        - allow multiple perl functions in the expressions and some bug 
          fixes
        - fix a parsing problem, '@' was not removed from '@filename' 
          expressions
    * `mpileup`: fixed bug where, if samples were renamed using the `-G` 
       (`--read-groups`) option, some samples could be omitted from the 
       output file.
    * `norm`: update INFO/END when normalizing indels
    * `+split`: new -S option to subset samples and to use custom file 
       names instead of the defaults
    * `+smpl-stats`: new plugin
    * `+trio-stats`: new plugin
    * Fixed build problems with non-functional configure script produced

- Cleaned spec file using spec-cleaner
- Update to 1.8
  * `-i, -e` filtering: Support for custom perl scripts
  * `+contrast`: New plugin to annotate genotype differences between groups of samples
  * `+fixploidy`: New options for simpler ploidy usage
  * `+setGT`: Target genotypes can be set to phased by giving `--new-gt p`
  * `run-roh.pl`: Allow to pass options directly to `bcftools roh`
  * Number of bug fixes
  * `-i, -e` filtering: Major revamp, improved filtering by FORMAT fields
    and missing values. New GT=ref,alt,mis etc keywords, check the documenation
    for details.
  * `query`: Only matching expression are printed when both the -f and -i/-e
    expressions contain genotype fields. Note that this changes the original
    behavior. Previously all samples were output when one matching sample was
    found. This functionality can be achieved by pre-filtering with view and then
    streaming to query. Compare
          bcftools query -f'[%CHROM:%POS %SAMPLE %GT\n]' -i'GT="alt"' file.bcf
    and
          bcftools view -i'GT="alt"' file.bcf -Ou | bcftools query -f'[%CHROM:%POS %SAMPLE %GT\n]'
  * `annotate`: New -k, --keep-sites option
  * `consensus`: Fix --iupac-codes output
  * `csq`: Homs always considered phased and other fixes
  * `norm`: Make `-c none` work and remove `query -c`
  * `roh`: Fix errors in the RG output
  * `stats`: Allow IUPAC ambiguity codes in the reference file; report the number of missing genotypes
  * `+fill-tags`: Add ExcHet annotation
  * `+setGt`: Fix bug in binom.test calculation, previously it worked only for nAlt<nRef!
  * `+split`: New plugin to split a multi-sample file into single-sample files in one go
  * Improve python3 compatibility in plotting scripts
  * New `sort` command.
  * New options added to the `consensus` command. Note that the `-i, --iupac`
    option has been renamed to `-I, --iupac`, in favor of the standard 
    `-i, --include`.
  * Filtering expressions (`-i/-e`): support for `GT=<type>` expressions and
    for lists and ranges (#639) - see the man page for details.
  * `csq`: relax some GFF3 parsing restrictions to enable using Ensembl
    GFF3 files for plants (#667)
  * `stats`: add further documentation to output stats files (#316) and
    include haploid counts in per-sample output (#671).
  * `plot-vcfstats`: further fixes for Python3 (@nsoranzo, #645, #666).
  * `query` bugfix (#632)
  * `+setGT` plugin: new option to set genotypes based on a two-tailed binomial
    distribution test. Also, allow combining `-i/-e` with `-t q`.
  * `mpileup`: fix typo (#636)
  * `convert --gvcf2vcf` bugfix (#641)
  * `+mendelian`: recognize some mendelian inconsistencies that were
    being missed (@oronnavon, #660), also add support for multiallelic
    sites and sex chromosomes.
