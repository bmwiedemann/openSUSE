  <title>Beans Binding (JSR 295) reference implementation</title>
  <description>In essence, Beans Binding (JSR 295) is about keeping two properties
(typically of two objects) in sync. An additional emphasis is placed on
the ability to bind to Swing components, and easy integration with IDEs
such as NetBeans. This project provides the reference implementation.</description>
