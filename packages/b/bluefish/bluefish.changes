- Update to version 2.2.11
  * Bluefish 2.2.11 is a minor maintenance release and minor feature release.
  * The only exception to that is the python 3 compatibility which is a major
    change. If you compile Bluefish with python 3, you might experience new
    bugs.
  * There are various minor changes as well.
  * Double click selection has been improved (for example selecting a function
    name that has underscores), and is now configurable per language.
  * Bluefish now has a feature to fill a line with spaces up to a mouse click,
    so you can start typing in any position on the screen (with a fixed width
    font).
  * A crash when running very large replace actions on disk on many files has
    been fixed.
  * Search and replace now ignores backup files by default.
  * Cursor highlighting and line highlighting have been fixed for a rare bug.
  * A small new feature has been added, to insert output from an external
    command in the current cursor position.
  * Many language files have seen updates, most notably CSS, Python and HTML.
  * A data loss bug - when an unknown encoding was selected - was fixed, the
    fallback is now to save as UTF-8.
  * A bug when saving with unknown characters in the filename has also been
    fixed.
  * Printing has been improved such as printing in landscape.
  * Some small tweaks to the UI have been implemented. For example you can now
    search in files in the filebrowser (right click a directory). Search
    results can now be shown in the output pane. 
  * The current identifier can be selected using <shift><control><i>.
  * Last there various fixes when Bluefish is run on top of Wayland.
