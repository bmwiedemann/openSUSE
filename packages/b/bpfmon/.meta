  <title>Traffic monitor for BPF expression/iptables rule</title>
  <description>While tcpdump shows what packets are going through the
network, bpfmon will show how much in terms
of bytes per second and packets per second in a
nice pseudo-graphical terminal interface.

bpfmon also supports monitoring an iptables rule that
is selected by command line option or selected from a
menu.
