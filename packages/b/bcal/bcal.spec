%description
bcal (Byte CALculator) is a command-line utility for storage, hardware and
firmware developers who deal with storage-specific numerical calculations,
expressions, unit conversions or address calculations frequently. If you are one
and cannot calculate the hex address offset for (512 - 16) MiB immediately, or
the value when the 43rd bit of a 64-bit address is set, bcal is for you.
