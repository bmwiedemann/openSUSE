-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul 14 16:05:02 UTC 2020 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Update to 3.6:
  - Removed msn, skype, oscar (icq/aim). For msn/skype use skypeweb, for
    ICQ use icyque. AIM is just dead.
  - Fix twitter (disable stream setting, set tweet length to 280)
    Note that users of 3.5.1 and older can re-enable twitter support by
    changing these two settings:

    account twitter set stream off
    account twitter set message_length 280

  - Add server-time IRCv3 capability
  - Large performance improvements for large contact lists

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 13 19:13:45 UTC 2018 - 9+suse@cirno.systems

- Command and comment cleaning.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun 14 12:05:51 UTC 2017 - tchvatal@suse.com

- Drop the xinetd service from the package
  * We are switching to socket services, on this service it does
    not make much sense to actually enable it like that thus
    simply drom the xinetd binding
- Remove always true version check

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb 27 08:33:21 UTC 2017 - mcaj@suse.com

- Version update to 3.5.1:
  * purple: 
     Fix crash on file transfer requests from unknown contacts. 
     This was the result of an incomplete fix in the previous 
     release and may result in remote DoS. Read the full security 
     advisory at: https://bugs.bitlbee.org/ticket/1282
  * After some investigation we decided to reclassify a crash fix 
     from the previous release as a security issue. Read the full security 
     advisory at: https://bugs.bitlbee.org/ticket/1281
  * Included help.txt in the release tarball, which was missing in 
     the previous release and resulted in adding python as a build 
     dependency. The release tarball of 3.5.1 does not require python.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan 24 08:20:23 UTC 2017 - shshyukriev@suse.com

- Version update to 3.5:
 * ui:
    "chat list": shows a list of existing server-side chatrooms.
    With some protocols, this is often the only way to add new channels.
    See 'help chat list' for details.
    "plugins": lists the installed plugins and their versions
    Add 'nick_lowercase' and 'nick_underscores' settings.
    "handle_unknown" can be set per-account, not just globally
 * jabber:
    Add "always_use_nicks" channel setting, for non-anonymous MUCs (trac #415)
    See 'help set always_use_nicks' for possible side effects.
    Properly handle rejected file transfers
    Don't send parts in a chat if someone is still connected from other devices
    hipchat: support personal oauth tokens (manually generated ones)
 * twitter:
    Hide muted tweets / no-retweets, add mute/unmute commands
    Show full version of extended tweets (with slightly more than 140 chars)
 * purple:
    Support setting chat room topics
    Support for extra groupchat settings. Shows an error if any required ones are missing.
     Look for purple_ prefixed settings in "chan #... set"
    SIPE: persistent chats can be joined now, thanks to the "chat list" command
     and the above ("purple_uri" channel setting)
    Fix a file transfer crash bug (Mainly affected telegram)
    Honor protocol flag to not require a password (used in hangouts, telegram)
    Set the contacts' nicks to the %full_name for a few whitelisted protocols (hangouts, funyahoo, icq, line)
    LINE: added a hack to save its auth token, to avoid re-auth every time
    Show self-messages in groupchat backlogs (before join)
 *yahoo:
    Removed because they killed their old protocol on a two month notice.
    Use EionRobb's funyahoo purple plugin, or better yet, don't use yahoo.
 *Stuff for enterprise deployments:
    Locked down accounts, useful when pregenerating user config files.
    An account that is marked with the locked="true" attribute can't be removed
    and its username/password can't be changed.
    Locked down settings. Same as above, but for individual account settings.
    AllowAccountAdd setting in bitlbee.conf, to disable adding new accounts.
    PAM and LDAP authentication backends (not compiled by default)
 *For packagers:
    Enabled debug symbols in non-debug builds, disabled stripping by default.
    This is closer to the default behavior of autotools,
    and --debug=1 is mostly to set the DEBUG macro and disable optimization.
 *For plugin devs:
    Plugins should now include an "init_plugin_info" function which will be used
    for ABI version checking in the future.
    It's optional for now, but will be enforced later.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan 29 06:46:02 UTC 2013 - vmiklos@suse.com

- update to 3.2:
  * By far the most important change, a thorough update to the Twitter
    module:
    * Now using Twitter API 1.1,
    * which means it's now using JSON instead of XML,
    * which means access to the streaming API (Twitter only, other Twitter
      API services don't seem to have it). No more 60-second polls, #twitter
      looks even more like real IRC now!
    * Also, the streaming API means nice things like receiving DMs.
    * show_ids, already enabled by default for a while, now uses hexa-
      decimal numbers, which means a 256-entry backlog instead of just 100.
    * Added a mode=strict setting which requires everything to be a command.
      The "post" command should then be used to post a Tweet.
  * Jabber module bugfix that fixes connection issues with at least Google
    Talk but reportedly some other servers (OpenFire?) as well.
  * SSL modules improved a little bit. GnuTLS module now supports SNI and
    session caching. Shouldn't change much, but hopefully reduces latency
    and bandwidth usage a little bit.
  * A bunch of other fixes/improvements here and there.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep  5 17:38:26 UTC 2012 - jmcdonough@suse.com

  * SSL certificate verification (edit your bitlbee.conf to enable it)
  * OAuth2 support in Jabber module (works with Google Talk, Facebook and MSN
    Messenger)
  * support for ad-hoc Jabber groupchats: just create a channel and start
    inviting people, similar to how this works on other IM networks. Works fine
    with GTalk, depends on a conference server being set up on other networks
  * allow old-style Jabber login (non-SASL), this solves problems with some
    old/buggy Jabber servers. (acc jabber set sasl off)
  * use HTTPS for OAuth1 authentication traffic
  * awareness of Twitter's t.co URL lengt^Wshortening when checking message
    length
  * fixed identi.ca OAuth support. OAuth will now always be used for both
    Twitter and identi.ca accounts
  * fix nick_format=%full_name with libpurple
  * instead of "protocol(handle)", use the account tags introduced in 3.0 when
    root wants to refer to an account (in log messages, queries, etc.)
  * many small bugfixes, improvements, etc

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Dec 18 00:57:26 UTC 2011 - darix@nordisch.org

- update to 3.0.4

    still is, but by including it with BitlBee by default it will
    be easier to keep it in sync with changes to BitlBee.
  - Fixed a file descriptor leak bug that may have caused strange
    behaviour in BitlBee sessions running for a long time.
  - Now fetches Twitter mentions as well if the "fetch_mentions"
    account setting is enabled.
  - With t.co now all over Twitter, show the original (but
    truncated) URL between <brackets>.
  - Fixed MSN Messenger login issues ("timeout" while fetching
    buddy list).

    recent tweets to use for retweets and replies (so you can RT/reply to more
    than just a person's last message)
  * some other Twitter fixes/improvements
  * "otr reconnect" command and some other fixes
  * include "FLOOD=0/9999" in the 005/ISUPPORT line at login to hint the IRC
    client that rate limiting is not required

    + fixed MSN login issues
    + fixed big memory leak in the MSN SOAP code
  * better handling of multiple control channels and set private=false
  * using login.icq.com for ICQ logins again since AOL sold ICQ so it doesn't
    live on the AIM servers anymore
  * fixed ability to join password-protected Jabber rooms
  * time out if logging into an account takes too long
  * support for server-side Gadu-Gadu contact lists (via libpurple, there's
    still no native gg support)
  * allow omitting password when using "account add", the password can be
    entered using /OPER to prevent echoing to screen and logs
