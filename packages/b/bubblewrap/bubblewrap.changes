 * retcode: fix return code with syncfd and no event_fd
 * Ensure we're always clearing the cap bounding set
 * tests: Update output patterns for libcap >= 2.29
 * Don't rely on geteuid() to know when to switch back from setuid root
 * Don't support --userns2 in setuid mode
 * fixes CVE-2020-5291
 * fixes bsc#1168291

Fri Dec 20 22:59:52 UTC 2019 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 0.4.0:
  + The biggest feature in this release is the support for joining
    existing user and pid namespaces. This doesn't work in the
    setuid mode (at the moment).
  + Other changes:
    - Stores namespace info in status json.
    - In setuid mode pid 1 is now marked dumpable.
    - Now builds with musl libc.

Sat Jun  1 15:08:49 UTC 2019 - Sebastian Wagner <sebix+novell.com@sebix.at>

- Update to version 0.3.3:
 - This release is the same as 0.3.2 but the version number in configure.ac
   was accidentally still set to 0.3.1
- Update to version 0.3.2:
 - fixes boo#1136958 / CVE-2019-12439
  This release fixes a mostly theoretical security issue in unusual/broken
  setups where `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` is unset.
  There are some other smaller fixes, as well as an addition to the JSON
  API that allows reading the inner process exit code, separately from
  the `bwrap` exit code.
  - Print "Out of memory" on stderr, not stdout
  - bwrap: add option json-status-fd to show child exit code
  - bwrap: Report COMMAND exit code in json-status-fd
  - man page: Describe --chdir, not nonexistent --cwd
  - Don't create our own temporary mount point for pivot_root
  - Make lockdata long enough on 32-bit with 64-bit file pointers.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct 11 16:41:12 UTC 2018 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com> - 0.3.1

- update to version 0.3.1:
  * New feature in this release is --bind-try (as well as --dev-bind-try
    and --ro-bind-try) which works like the regular versions if the source
    exists, but does nothing if it doesn't exist.

  * The mount type for the root tmpfs was also changed to "tmpfs" instead
    of being empty, as the later could cause problems with some programs
    when parsing the mountinfo files in /proc.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jul 14 20:06:50 UTC 2018 - sebix+novell.com@sebix.at

- update to version 0.3.0:
  * The biggest feature from this release is that bwrap
    now supports being invoked recursively (from other container
    runtimes such as Docker/podman/runc as well as bwrap itself)
    when user namespaces are enabled, and the outer container manager
    allows it (Docker's default seccomp policy doesn't).

  * This is useful for testing scenarios; for example a project
    uses Kubernetes for its CI, but inside build the project wants to run
    each unit test in their own pid namespace, without going out
    and creating a new pod for every single unit test.

  * Similarly, rpm-ostree compose tree uses bwrap internally for scripts,
    and we want to support running rpm-ostree inside a container as well.

  * Another feature is bwrap now supports -- to terminate argument
    parsing. To detect availablity of this, you could parse bwrap --version.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May  1 21:02:33 UTC 2018 - sebix+novell.com@sebix.at

- update to version 0.2.1:
 * All the demos are included
 * bugfixes for the demo files
 * There was an issue with mkdir when running bubblewrap on an NFS
   filesystem that has been fixed, so flatpak now works on NFS shares.
 * Some leaks have been fixed, including a file descriptor leak.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct  9 17:53:37 UTC 2017 - sebix+novell.com@sebix.at

- update to version 0.2.0
 - bwrap now automatically detects the new
   user namespace restrictions in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4:
   bubblewrap: check for max_user_namespaces == 0.
 - The most notable features are new arguments --as-pid1, and
   --cap-add/--cap-drop. These were added for running systemd (or in general a
   "full" init system) inside bubblewrap. But the capability options are also
   useful for unprivileged callers to potentially retain capbilities inside the
   sandbox (for example CAP_NET_ADMIN), when user namespaces are enabled.
   Conversely, privileged callers (uid 0) can conversely drop capabilities (without
   user namespaces). Contributed by Giuseppe Scrivano.
 - With --dev, add /dev/fd and /dev/core symlinks
   which should improve compatibility with older software.

Thu Mar  2 09:08:58 UTC 2017 - sebix+novell.com@sebix.at

- upgrade to upstream version 0.1.7
- note that this package was *never* affected by CVE-2017-5226
  as it was introduced in version 0.1.6
- upstream changelog of version 0.1.7:
    This release backs out the change in 0.1.6 which unconditionally
    called setsid() in order to fix a security issue with TIOCSTI, aka
    CVE-2017-522. That change caused some behavioural issues that are
    hard to work with in some cases. For instance, it makes shell job
    control not work for the bwrap command.
    Instead there is now a new option --new-session which works like
    0.1.6. It is recommended that you use this if possible, but if not we
    recommended that you neutralize this some other way, for instance
    using SECCOMP, which is what flatpak does:
    https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/902fb713990a8f968ea4350c7c2a27ff46f1a6c4
    In order to make it easy to create maximally safe sandboxes we have
    also added a new commandline switch called --unshare-all. It unshares
    all possible namespaces and is currently equivalent with:
    --unshare-user-try --unshare-ipc --unshare-pid --unshare-net
    --unshare-uts --unshare-cgroup-try
    However, the intent is that as new namespaces are added to the kernel they will
    be added to this list. Additionally, if --share-net is specified the network
    namespace is not unshared.
    This release also has some bugfixes:
        bwrap reaps (unexpected) children that are inherited from the
        parent, something which can happen if bwrap is part of a shell
        pipeline.
        bwrap clears the capability bounding set. The permitted
        capabilities was already empty, and use of PR_NO_NEW_PRIVS should
        make it impossible to increase the capabilities, but more
        layers of protection is better.
        The seccomp filter is now installed at the very end of bwrap, which
        means the requirement of the filter is minimal. Any bwrap seccomp
        filter must at least allow: execve, waitpid and write
    Alexander Larsson (7):
          Handle inherited children dying
          Clear capability bounding set
          Make the call to setsid() optional, with --new-session
          demos/bubblewrap-shell.sh: Unshare all namespaces
          Call setsid() and setexeccon() befor forking the init monitor
          Install seccomp filter at the very end
          Bump version to 0.1.7
    Colin Walters (6):
          Release 0.1.6
          man: Correct namespace user -> mount
          demo/shell: Add /var/tmp compat symlink, tweak PS1, add more docs
          Release 0.1.6
          ci: Combine ASAN and UBSAN
          Add --unshare-all and --share-net
- upstream changelog for 0.1.6:
    This fixes a security issue with TIOCSTI, aka CVE-2017-522. Note bubblewrap is
    far from the only program that has this issue, and I think the best fix is
    probably in the kernel to support disabling this ioctl.

    Programs can also work around this by calling setsid() on their own in an exec
    handler before doing an exevp("bwrap").
- upstream changelog for 0.1.5:
    This is a bugfix release, here are the major changes:
        Running bubblewrap as root now works again
        Various fixes for the testsuite
        Use same default compiler warnings as ostree
        Handle errors resolving symlinks during bind mounts
    Alexander Larsson (2):
          bind-mount: Check for errors in realpath()
          Bump version to 0.1.5
    Colin Walters (6):
          Don't call capset() unless we need to
          Only --unshare-user automatically if we're not root
          ci: Modernize a bit, add f25-ubsan
          README.md: Update with better one liner and more information
          utils: Add __attribute__((printf)) to die()
          build: Sync default warning -> error set from ostree
    Simon McVittie (4):
          test-run: be a bash script
          test-run: don't assume we are uid 1000
          Adapt tests so they can be run against installed binaries
          Fix incorrect nesting of backticks when finding a FUSE mount
