Wed May 18 12:43:26 UTC 2022 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 0.6.2:
  + New features in Meson build:
    - Auto-detect whether the man page can be generated.
    - -Dbwrapdir=... changes the installation directory (useful
       when being used as a subproject).
    - -Dtests=false disables unit tests.
  + Bug fixes:
    - Add --add-seccomp-fd to shell completions
    - Document --add-seccomp-fd, --json-status-fd and --share-net
      in the man page
    - Add attributes to silence various compiler warnings
    - Allow compilation of tests with musl on mips architectures
    - Allow compilation with older glibc
    - Disable sanitizers for a test helper whose seccomp profile
      breaks the instrumentation
    - Disable AddressSanitizer leak detection where it interferes
      with unit testing

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar  4 18:13:15 UTC 2022 - Sebastian Wagner <sebix+novell.com@sebix.at>

- Update to 0.6.1:
 - Add a release checklist
 - completions: Make zsh completion non-executable
   The Autotools build system installed it with 0644 permissions because
   it's listed as DATA, but the Meson build system installs executable
   files as executable by default.
   zsh completions don't need to be executable to work, and this one doesn't
   have the `#!` marker that should start an executable script.
- update to 0.6.0:
 - meson: Improve compatibility with Meson 0.49
   That version doesn't allow more than two arguments for define_variable.
 - Disable test-specifying-pidns.sh under 'meson dist' while I investigate
   This test is hanging when run under 'meson dist' for some reason, but
   not when run under 'meson test', and not locally, only in the Github
   Workflow-based CI. Disable it for now.
 - meson: Actually build and run the tests
 - tests: Fix compiler warnings for unused arguments
 - meson: Run test scripts from $srcdir
 - meson: Make G_TEST_SRCDIR, G_TEST_BUILDDIR match Autotools
 - meson: Run the Python test script with Python, not bash
   The python build option can be used to swap to a different interpreter,
   for environments like the Steam Runtime where the python3 executable in
   the PATH is extremely old but there is a better interpreter available.
   This is treated as non-optional, because Meson is written in Python,
   so the situation where there is no Python interpreter at build-time
   shouldn't arise.
 - meson: Build the try-syscall helper
 - meson: Build tests with equivalent of -I$(top_srcdir) -I$(top_builddir)
 - meson.build: Remove unnecessary check for sh
 - Add a Meson build system
   This allows bwrap to be built as a subproject in larger Meson projects.
   When built as a subproject, we install into the --libexecdir and
   require a program prefix to be specified: for example, Flatpak would use
   program_prefix=flatpak- to get /usr/libexec/flatpak-bwrap. Verified to
   be backwards-compatible as far as Meson 0.49.0 (Debian 9 backports).
   Loosely based on previous work by Jussi Pakkanen (see #133).
   Differences between the Autotools and Meson builds:
   The Meson build requires a version of libcap that has pkg-config
   metadata (introduced in libcap 2.23, in 2013).
   The Meson build has no equivalent of --with-priv-mode=setuid. On
   distributions like Debian <= 10 and RHEL <= 7 that require a setuid bwrap
   executable, the sysadmin or distribution packaging will need to set the
   correct permissions on the bwrap executable; Debian already did this via
   packaging rather than the upstream build system.
   The Meson build supports being used as a subproject, and there is CI
   for this. It automatically disables shell completions and man pages,
   moves the bubblewrap executable to ${libexecdir}, and renames the
   bubblewrap executable according to a program_prefix option that the
   caller must specify (for example, Flatpak would use
   -Dprogram_prefix=flatpak- to get /usr/libexec/flatpak-bwrap). See the
   tests/use-as-subproject/ directory for an example.
 - Use HEAD to refer to other projects' default branches in documentation
   This makes the URL independent of the name they have chosen for their
   default branches.
 - workflows: Update for rename of default branch to main
 - tests: Exercise seccomp filters
 - Allow loading more than one seccomp program
   This will allow Flatpak to combine an allow-list (default-deny) of
   known system calls with a deny-list (default-allow) of system calls
   that are undesired.
   Resolves: https://github.com/containers/bubblewrap/issues/453
 - Generalize linked lists of LockFile and SetupOp
   I'm about to add a third linked list, for seccomp programs, which would
   seem like too much duplication.
 - Handle argc == 0 better
   Unfortunately it's possible for argc to be 0, so error out pretty early
   on in that case. I don't think this is a security issue in this case.
 - Fix typo
 - Remove trailing whitespace
 - Fix spelling
 - bash: Fix shellcheck warnings
 - bash: Invoke bash using /usr/bin/env
 - bubblewrap: Avoid a -Wjump-misses-init false-positive
   When building with -Wjump-misses-init as part of a larger project, gcc
   reports that we jump past initialization of cover_proc_dirs. This is
   technically true, but we only use this variable in the case where it's
   initialized, so that's harmless.
   However, we can avoid this altogether by making the array static and
   constant, which allows it to be moved from initialized data to read-only
   data.
 - bind-mount: Be more const-correct
   When compiled with -Wwrite-strings as part of a larger project, gcc and
   clang both warn that we're assigning a string constant to a mutable
   struct member. There's actually no reason why it should be mutable, so
   make it const.
 - die_with_error: Save errno sooner
   We need to save errno immediately, otherwise it could be overwritten
   by a failing library call somewhere in the implementation of fprintf.
 - main: Warn when non-repeatable options are repeated
   A user might reasonably expect that `bwrap --seccomp 3 --seccomp 4 ...`
   would load seccomp programs from both fds 3 and 4, but in fact it only
   loads the program from fd 4.
   Helps: https://github.com/containers/bubblewrap/issues/453
   Resolves: https://github.com/containers/bubblewrap/issues/454
 - utils: Add warn()
 - Add SPDX-License-Identifier for files that already specify license
   This is a step towards REUSE compliance. Third-party files that we do
   not otherwise edit (git.mk, m4/attributes.m4) are excluded here.
 - tests: Use preferred spelling for SPDX license identifiers
 - Remove obsolete .travis.yml
   We no longer use Travis-CI.
 - Remove obsolete papr CI
   We no longer use this.

  + New features:
    - --chmod changes permissions
    - --clearenv unsets every environment variable (except PWD)
    - --perms sets permissions for one subsequent --bind-data,
      --dir, --file, --ro-bind-data or --tmpfs
  + Other enhancements:

    - Don't remount items in /proc read-only if already EROFS,
      required to run under Docker
    - Allow mounting an non-directory over an existing
      non-directory, e.g. --bind "$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/my-log-socket"
      /dev/log
    - Silence kernel messages for our bind-mounts

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr  1 10:03:39 UTC 2020 - Sebastian Wagner <sebix+novell.com@sebix.at>

- Update to version 0.4.1:
 * retcode: fix return code with syncfd and no event_fd
 * Ensure we're always clearing the cap bounding set
 * tests: Update output patterns for libcap >= 2.29
 * Don't rely on geteuid() to know when to switch back from setuid root
 * Don't support --userns2 in setuid mode
 * fixes CVE-2020-5291
 * fixes bsc#1168291

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Dec 20 22:59:52 UTC 2019 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 0.4.0:
  + The biggest feature in this release is the support for joining
    existing user and pid namespaces. This doesn't work in the
    setuid mode (at the moment).
  + Other changes:
    - Stores namespace info in status json.
    - In setuid mode pid 1 is now marked dumpable.
    - Now builds with musl libc.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun  7 14:38:21 UTC 2019 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Use /bin/bash instead of /usr/bin/bash in SLE12

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jun  1 15:08:49 UTC 2019 - Sebastian Wagner <sebix+novell.com@sebix.at>

- Update to version 0.3.3:
 - This release is the same as 0.3.2 but the version number in configure.ac
   was accidentally still set to 0.3.1
- Update to version 0.3.2:
 - fixes boo#1136958 / CVE-2019-12439
  This release fixes a mostly theoretical security issue in unusual/broken
  setups where `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` is unset.
  There are some other smaller fixes, as well as an addition to the JSON
  API that allows reading the inner process exit code, separately from
  the `bwrap` exit code.
  - Print "Out of memory" on stderr, not stdout
  - bwrap: add option json-status-fd to show child exit code
  - bwrap: Report COMMAND exit code in json-status-fd
  - man page: Describe --chdir, not nonexistent --cwd
  - Don't create our own temporary mount point for pivot_root
  - Make lockdata long enough on 32-bit with 64-bit file pointers.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct 11 16:41:12 UTC 2018 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com> - 0.3.1

- update to version 0.3.1:
  * New feature in this release is --bind-try (as well as --dev-bind-try
    and --ro-bind-try) which works like the regular versions if the source
    exists, but does nothing if it doesn't exist.

  * The mount type for the root tmpfs was also changed to "tmpfs" instead
    of being empty, as the later could cause problems with some programs
    when parsing the mountinfo files in /proc.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jul 14 20:06:50 UTC 2018 - sebix+novell.com@sebix.at

- update to version 0.3.0:
  * The biggest feature from this release is that bwrap
    now supports being invoked recursively (from other container
    runtimes such as Docker/podman/runc as well as bwrap itself)
    when user namespaces are enabled, and the outer container manager
    allows it (Docker's default seccomp policy doesn't).

  * This is useful for testing scenarios; for example a project
    uses Kubernetes for its CI, but inside build the project wants to run
    each unit test in their own pid namespace, without going out
    and creating a new pod for every single unit test.

  * Similarly, rpm-ostree compose tree uses bwrap internally for scripts,
    and we want to support running rpm-ostree inside a container as well.

  * Another feature is bwrap now supports -- to terminate argument
    parsing. To detect availablity of this, you could parse bwrap --version.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May  1 21:02:33 UTC 2018 - sebix+novell.com@sebix.at

- update to version 0.2.1:
 * All the demos are included
 * bugfixes for the demo files
 * There was an issue with mkdir when running bubblewrap on an NFS
   filesystem that has been fixed, so flatpak now works on NFS shares.
 * Some leaks have been fixed, including a file descriptor leak.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct  9 17:53:37 UTC 2017 - sebix+novell.com@sebix.at

- update to version 0.2.0
 - bwrap now automatically detects the new
   user namespace restrictions in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4:
   bubblewrap: check for max_user_namespaces == 0.
 - The most notable features are new arguments --as-pid1, and
   --cap-add/--cap-drop. These were added for running systemd (or in general a
   "full" init system) inside bubblewrap. But the capability options are also
   useful for unprivileged callers to potentially retain capbilities inside the
   sandbox (for example CAP_NET_ADMIN), when user namespaces are enabled.
   Conversely, privileged callers (uid 0) can conversely drop capabilities (without
   user namespaces). Contributed by Giuseppe Scrivano.
 - With --dev, add /dev/fd and /dev/core symlinks
   which should improve compatibility with older software.

Thu Mar  2 09:08:58 UTC 2017 - sebix+novell.com@sebix.at

- upgrade to upstream version 0.1.7
- note that this package was *never* affected by CVE-2017-5226
  as it was introduced in version 0.1.6
- upstream changelog of version 0.1.7:
    This release backs out the change in 0.1.6 which unconditionally
    called setsid() in order to fix a security issue with TIOCSTI, aka
    CVE-2017-522. That change caused some behavioural issues that are
    hard to work with in some cases. For instance, it makes shell job
    control not work for the bwrap command.
    Instead there is now a new option --new-session which works like
    0.1.6. It is recommended that you use this if possible, but if not we
    recommended that you neutralize this some other way, for instance
    using SECCOMP, which is what flatpak does:
    https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/902fb713990a8f968ea4350c7c2a27ff46f1a6c4
    In order to make it easy to create maximally safe sandboxes we have
    also added a new commandline switch called --unshare-all. It unshares
    all possible namespaces and is currently equivalent with:
    --unshare-user-try --unshare-ipc --unshare-pid --unshare-net
    --unshare-uts --unshare-cgroup-try
    However, the intent is that as new namespaces are added to the kernel they will
    be added to this list. Additionally, if --share-net is specified the network
    namespace is not unshared.
    This release also has some bugfixes:
        bwrap reaps (unexpected) children that are inherited from the
        parent, something which can happen if bwrap is part of a shell
        pipeline.
        bwrap clears the capability bounding set. The permitted
        capabilities was already empty, and use of PR_NO_NEW_PRIVS should
        make it impossible to increase the capabilities, but more
        layers of protection is better.
        The seccomp filter is now installed at the very end of bwrap, which
        means the requirement of the filter is minimal. Any bwrap seccomp
        filter must at least allow: execve, waitpid and write
    Alexander Larsson (7):
          Handle inherited children dying
          Clear capability bounding set
          Make the call to setsid() optional, with --new-session
          demos/bubblewrap-shell.sh: Unshare all namespaces
          Call setsid() and setexeccon() befor forking the init monitor
          Install seccomp filter at the very end
          Bump version to 0.1.7
    Colin Walters (6):
          Release 0.1.6
          man: Correct namespace user -> mount
          demo/shell: Add /var/tmp compat symlink, tweak PS1, add more docs
          Release 0.1.6
          ci: Combine ASAN and UBSAN
          Add --unshare-all and --share-net
- upstream changelog for 0.1.6:
    This fixes a security issue with TIOCSTI, aka CVE-2017-522. Note bubblewrap is
    far from the only program that has this issue, and I think the best fix is
    probably in the kernel to support disabling this ioctl.

    Programs can also work around this by calling setsid() on their own in an exec
    handler before doing an exevp("bwrap").
- upstream changelog for 0.1.5:
    This is a bugfix release, here are the major changes:
        Running bubblewrap as root now works again
        Various fixes for the testsuite
        Use same default compiler warnings as ostree
        Handle errors resolving symlinks during bind mounts
    Alexander Larsson (2):
          bind-mount: Check for errors in realpath()
          Bump version to 0.1.5
    Colin Walters (6):
          Don't call capset() unless we need to
          Only --unshare-user automatically if we're not root
          ci: Modernize a bit, add f25-ubsan
          README.md: Update with better one liner and more information
          utils: Add __attribute__((printf)) to die()
          build: Sync default warning -> error set from ostree
    Simon McVittie (4):
          test-run: be a bash script
          test-run: don't assume we are uid 1000
          Adapt tests so they can be run against installed binaries
          Fix incorrect nesting of backticks when finding a FUSE mount
