  <title>Boost C++ Libraries</title>
  <description>Boost provides free peer-reviewed portable C++ source libraries. The
emphasis is on libraries that work well with the C++ Standard Library.
One goal is to establish &quot;existing practice&quot; and provide reference
implementations so that the Boost libraries are suitable for eventual
standardization. Some of the libraries have already been proposed for
inclusion in the C++ Standards Committee's upcoming C++ Standard
Library Technical Report.

Although Boost was begun by members of the C++ Standards Committee
Library Working Group, membership has expanded to include nearly two
thousand members of the C++ community at large.

This package is mainly needed for updating from a prior version, the
dynamic libraries are found in their respective package. For development
using Boost, you also need the boost-devel package. For documentation,
see the boost-doc package.</description>
