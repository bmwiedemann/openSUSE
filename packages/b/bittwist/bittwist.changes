- Update to version 3.7
  Changes since 2.0:
  general
  * added support for trace files with nanosecond resolution.
  * updated manual pages.
  * use in-memory trace files when sending packets in loop.
  * fixed integer overflow in stats output.
  * added static code analysis in Makefile (make check).
  * reformatted source files for C17 standard.
  * added initial python testing framework for Linux systems.
  bittwist (generator):
  * 30% speed up when sending large pcap file.
  * fixed linerate throttling.
  * updated -p option to send packets at set packets per second
    (pps).
  * added -t option to set inter-packet gap (this was previously
    -p option).
  * removed speed (-m) flag; use -p/-r to shape throughput.
  * updated linerate (-r) flag to use token bucket algorithm.
  bittwiste (editor)
  * added -G option to set fixed or random inter-packet gap in
    microseconds.
  * added support for CIDR notation when modifying IPv4/IPv6
    addressA.
  * added support for random MAC address.
  * added option to edit IPv6 next header.
  * added random number support for id, ttl, proto, next header,
    hop limit.
  * added option to set uniformly distributed random number
    (mersenne twister). for tcp/udp source/destination port and
    tcp sequence/acknowledgment number.
  * added -N flag to duplicate packets from trace file, e.g.
    -N 100000 to repeat packets from trace file for 100,000 times
  * added ip6tcp and ip6udp templates.
  * updated -I flag to allow loading trace file from built-in
    templates.
  * options to edit IPv4/IPv6 packets to allow testing of
    classification/queuing.  features of switches/routers, e.g.
    + -T ip -e 3 to indicate congestion to the end hosts
    + -T ip6 -c 16 to classify packet for operation and management
      of the network
    + -T ip6 -f 0xfffff to set custom flow label
  * added support for IPv6 packets.
  * improved cksum().
  * expanded test cases.
- Update patch:
  * bittwist-makefile.diff
