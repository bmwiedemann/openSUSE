Wed Jul 16 10:35:23 UTC 2025 - Gerald Chen <gerald_chen@foxmail.com>

- Update to 0.11:
  * Introduce *extent scan mode* that scans the extent tree directly. It is the
    new default scan mode.
  * Show estimated data size and expected time to finish scanning in logs and
    status outputs.
  * Smarter dedupe criteria that prevents dedupe operations that save less than
    half the blocks in an extent or require more than 100 copy/dedupe operations
    to free space.
  * Add the new dynamic rate throttling option `--throttle-factor` to estimate
    the rate at which the kernel deletes extents and slow down dedupe requests
    to match this rate.
  * Threads now dynamically redistribute their work so that they can make
    continuous progress without waiting for each other.
  * Remove excessively costly "toxic extent" workarounds yielding up to
    100x–1000x speed boost on some workloads.
  * Coordinate between threads to prevent thrashing during disk reads.
  * Prefetche data into page-cache before dedupe calls.
  * Submit full-extent dedupe operations, avoiding obsolete 16M kernel limits.
  * Reduce the size of `ioctl` buffers, which avoids forcing the kernel to
    evict pages from memory to accommodate large buffers.
  * Limit reference counts for very frequently duplicated data, which avoids
    performance issues in btrfs (even when bees is not running).
  * Use the new `openat2` system call for improved robustness against rename and
    symlink attacks.
  * Use a private mount namespace for isolation even without `systemd`.
  * Recude warning and debug log verbosity.
  * `SIGUSR1` and `SIGUSR2` signals allow bees to be paused and unpaused without
    preventing bees from closing open files and subvols during the pause.
  * It is now safe to locate `$BEESHOME` on filesystems such as XFS that lack
    data flushing on `rename`.
  * Fix 32-bit `ioctl` compatibility for mixed 32/64-bit systems.
  * Detect a `btrfs send` in progress, and wait for it to complete
    automatically. `--workaround-btrfs-send` is no longer necessary when used
    with extent scan mode.

Thu Mar  7 15:05:28 UTC 2024 - Max Lin <mlin@suse.com>

- Fix build fail with gcc7 on Leap 15
  * Use gcc13 on compilation

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul 24 13:28:10 UTC 2023 - Frederic Crozat <fcrozat@suse.com>

- Update to 0.10:
 * Update kernel bugs list to 6.4.1
 * Update docs
 * Build fixes for GCC 13 and clang 16
- Drop avoid-swap.patch, no longer needed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr  4 06:59:34 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 0.9.3:
  * roots: don't share a RootFetcher between threads
  * seeker: fix the test for ILP32 platforms
  * reduce memory usage with long-running work items
  * allow BtrfsIoctlLogicalInoArgs to be reused, remove virtual methods
  * create a Pool of BtrfsIoctlLogicalInoArgs objects 
- add avoid-swap.patch to fix build with gcc 13

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb 14 07:27:50 UTC 2023 - Avinesh Kumar <avinesh.kumar@suse.com>

- update to 0.9.1:
  * Fix the install target.
  * Makefile: also drop fiemap and fiewalk from main Makefile

- update to 0.9:
  - Highlights:
    * Work around a kernel bug which can be triggered by running the
      LOGICAL_INO ioctl and dedupe on the same extent at the same time.
    * Prevent worker threads from being blocked by extent and inode
      locks.  Defer the blocked item and find something else for that
      worker thread to do.
    * Fix the labelling of threads so they aren't all "task_consumer".
    * Speed up SIGTERM process termination to have a better chance of
      flushing the hash table and crawl state to $BEESHOME before the
      process is killed by a service timeout.
    * Reduce the hash table writeback rate to 128K/s.
    * Reduce the interval between crawl restarts to one transid.
    * Add 'recent' scan mode, which dedupes new data in fully scanned
      subvols instead of waiting for every old subvol to be scanned.
    * Better behavior when there are write errors in $BEESHOME.
    * Drop the unused and obsolete `fiemap` and `fiewalk` binaries.
