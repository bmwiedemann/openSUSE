- update to 0.9.1:
  * Fix the install target.
  * Makefile: also drop fiemap and fiewalk from main Makefile

- update to 0.9:
  - Highlights:
    * Work around a kernel bug which can be triggered by running the
      LOGICAL_INO ioctl and dedupe on the same extent at the same time.
    * Prevent worker threads from being blocked by extent and inode
      locks.  Defer the blocked item and find something else for that
      worker thread to do.
    * Fix the labelling of threads so they aren't all "task_consumer".
    * Speed up SIGTERM process termination to have a better chance of
      flushing the hash table and crawl state to $BEESHOME before the
      process is killed by a service timeout.
    * Reduce the hash table writeback rate to 128K/s.
    * Reduce the interval between crawl restarts to one transid.
    * Add 'recent' scan mode, which dedupes new data in fully scanned
      subvols instead of waiting for every old subvol to be scanned.
    * Better behavior when there are write errors in $BEESHOME.
    * Drop the unused and obsolete `fiemap` and `fiewalk` binaries.
