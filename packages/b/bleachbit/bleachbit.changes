 + Remove typelib-1_0-Gtk-3_0 Requires: this is now propelry
   auto-detected (together with the other typelib-* deps).

  o When showing a warning, show which option generated the warning.
  o Specific to Linux
     - Support Thunderbird on openSUSE 11.3 thanks to Manfred Schwarb (LP#668231)
     - Fix wrong button label when adding folders for overwrite disk space and for whitelist (pointed out by jtarin)
     - When cleaning localizations, show warning to point user to configuration
     - Packagers: BleachBit will try to use the built-in json module on Python 2.6+ instead of simplejson, which is still required on Python 2.5.

- update to version 0.8.6
- BleachBit 0.8.6 fixes an issue in 0.8.5 for Google Chrome and Chromium:
  o Now all the search engine changes are moved out of "History" to a separate option called "Search engines."
  o Default search engines (Google, Yahoo, Bing) will not be removed. If you cannot search Google using the Omnibox, see the instructions in the 0.8.5 release notes .
  o Now the usage statistics for the default search engines will be reset to zero (instead of deleting them).
  o Non-default search engines will be removed because the browser automatically, quietly adds them for many sites (such as CNN, Youtube, and many others) while you browse, so it creates a usage history. (Before you ever clean them, follow the instructions Manage Search Engines to see how many are listed.)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan  3 19:38:29 UTC 2011 - saigkill@opensuse.org

- update to version 0.8.5
- Changes since BleachBit 0.8.4:
  o Google Chrome/Chromium: delete the StartupDNSPrefetchList (hostnames used for DNS cache).
  o Google Chrome/Chromium: delete the HostReferralList (contains URLs which the browser cannot clean itself).
  o Google Chrome/Chromium: delete keywords table. Whenever you visit a web site a certain kind of site search (you may be surprised how many there are), the browser quietly remembers the URL for searching the site.
  o Google Chrome/Chromium: clean autofill (form) history
  o Google Chrome/Chromium: fully support secure shredding (overwrite) for all options--even those that do not remove the whole file.
  o Google Chrome: move some of history to DOM Storage option.
  o Google Chrome: delete top sites in history
  o Google Chrome: vacuum more
  o Chromium: delete many more files (now similar to Google Chrome)
  o Chromium: detect running process
  o Opera: delete HTML5 local storage (HTML5 cookies)
  o Firefox: improve cleaning orphan favicon and history_visits entries in places database
  o Firefox: remove Places option. Despite the warning, people seemed confused or afraid of this option. You can still clean Firefox history without it.
  o Add JSON to CleanerML
  o Shred file when modifying .ini. Right now only VLC uses a .ini cleaner, though the .ini cleaner is available in CleanerML for custom cleaners too.
  o Update checker now (optionally) finds beta versions too
  o Avoid potential divide by zero error in free disk space wipe
  o Specific to Linux
    + Add support for cleaning swap files (in addition to swap devices; LP#599133)
    + Packagers: BleachBit now requires simplejson.

- prettyfied the spec file

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Dec 18 12:46:27 UTC 2010 - saigkill@opensuse.org

- update to version 0.8.4
- Changes since BleachBit 0.8.3:
  * When deep scan was enabled, BleachBit 0.8.3 would freeze with the progress bar displaying the name of the last cleaner (so it could be any one of 90 different names). Sorry!
  * In addition to fixing this bug (of course), new automatic tests will prevent this from happening in the future. From the beginning, BleachBit has extensively used automatic tests to ensure quality.
If you do not use deep scan, check back in a few weeks for 0.8.5. You can subscribe to updates through RSS, ATOM, or Twitter using the icons on the blue panel on the right.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec 13 17:56:59 UTC 2010 - saigkill@opensuse.org

- updated to version 0.8.3
  * Wiping free disk space is now significantly faster. (The actual time will depend mainly on how much free disk space you have and how fast your disk is.)
  * When wiping free disk space, show progress bar and estimated time to completion.
    o Screenshot progress bar on Windows 7
      * To improve efficiency and maximize privacy, operations are now executed in this order: general cleaning, deep scan, RAM and swap cleaning, and free disk space wiping.
      * Add menu option to wipe free disk space anywhere on the computer. One way this is useful is for wiping free disk space on removable media such as USB disks, or use it to avoid enabling the free disk space option checkbox (which most people should not use often).
      * Add menu option to securely shred any folder (including all folders and files contained within) anywhere on your computer.
      * Add context menu to options, so you can preview or execute individual options without changing any checkboxes. Just right click on an option (not a group of options) to see the new menu.
    o screenshot of new context menu on Fedora 13
      * Delete more icons found in Opera.
      * Delete more URL history in Opera.
      * Delete search history in Opera.
      * Do not delete extension preferences in Google Chrome (which store configuration as HTML5 cookies).
      * Fixed bug '[error 21] "is a directory" when shredding directories. (This bug existed only in version 0.8.2.)
      * CleanerML (Cleaner Markup Language) now supports glob for walk.all and walk.files.
      * Specific to Linux
          o Add RPM packages for openSUSE 11.3.
          o Add ..deb package Ubuntu 10.10 final

-------------------------------------------------------------------

    * Specific to Linux bonus pack (separate download)
          o Fix bonus pack not installing on Ubuntu 10.10
          o Clean Xfce xfrun4 command history (thanks to nodiscc)
          o Clean Battle for Wesnoth (thanks to Thibault Févry)
    * Specific to Windows
          o Fix bug starting on Windows XP with language set to non-English
          o Delete form history in Internet Explorer 7 and 8
          o Delete user assist history: it is included in Windows Explorer - Most Recently Used.
          o Clean WinZip (thanks to Jack Williams)
          o Clean TortoiseSVN (thanks to Jack Williams )
    * Specific to web
          o New documentation: Shred files and wipe disks

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct  5 17:01:46 UTC 2010 - saigkill@opensuse.org

- Updated to Version 0.8.1
- The following changes have been made:
    * Delete DOM Storage in Firefox 3, Google Chrome, and Opera.
    * Completely remove evercookie tracking, a system that "produces extremely persistent cookies in a browser." Clean evercookies in Firefox, Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Opera, and Safari. Test it yoursel:create an evercookie on Samy Kamkar's evercookie site, clean it, and check on the same site it is gone.
    * Clean VLC (VideoLAN Client)'s .ini configuration file.
    * Add generic capability to clean most .ini configuration files through CleanerML. Because .ini is not standardized, additional work is needed to some kinds of .ini files.
    * Specific to Linux
          o Add .deb package for Ubuntu 10.10 Maverick Meerkat.
          o When running as root, refuse to open web browser (such as for help contents) with root privileges.
          o Delete about 16MB more localizations as tested on Ubuntu 10.10.
          o Fix missing menu shortcut on Ubuntu 10 (LP#592051).

          o Delete Silverlight cookies.
          o Vacuum Safari.
          o Clean memory dumps.
          o Define %localappdata% environment variable on Windows XP, and use it for many existing cleaners. This may provide more reliable detection of files on certain Vista and Windows 7 systems.
    * Specific to web
          o Now you can follow BleachBit on Twitter.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun 17 23:34:17 UTC 2010 - saigkill@opensuse.org

- Updated to Version 0.8.0
- Changes
- The following changes have been made since 0.7.4:
  * Add whitelisting feature, so certain files and folders are not modified. Setup your whitelist in the preferences dialog. The whitelist feature supports all the standard operations including delete, shred, truncate, and vacuum, but it doesn't affect files deleted by third-party software (yum and apt). Files that are whitelisted are clearly marked in the BleachBit log.
  * Specific to Linux
    o Delete recent documents in GNOME 2.28 - 2.30 (e.g., Ubuntu Karmic Kaola, Lucid Lynx, Fedora 13).
    o Use GTK+ Recent Manager to purge recent documents list.
    o Support Thunderbird 3 as found on Ubuntu Lucid Lynx 10.04.
    o Introduce .rpm package for Fedora 13 (Goddard).
- Known issues
  o Wiping memory and swap is currently experimental. It should always wipe 100% of the swap, but it may not wipe 100% of the physical memory. Before using this option, close all other running applications because they may be automatically killed by Linux.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr 16 15:38:43 UTC 2010 - saigkill@opensuse.org

- The following changes have been made since 0.7.3:

    * Add new privacy feature: click File - Shred Files and Quit. This removes all BleachBit settings as if you never ran BleachBit, so other people can't tell you have.
    * Use EIC binary prefixes (e.g., 1KiB=1000 bytes) instead of SI binary prefixes (e.g., 1kB=1024B) because EIC is the proper standard for disk space. For more information see see Wikipedia's Binary Prefix article and Ubuntu's unit policy.
    * Fix bug removing paths in preferences dialog.
    * Add translation contexts for more accurate translations.
    * Fix deleting files with non-ASCII names.
    * Specific to Linux
          o Add package for Ubuntu Lucid Lynx (10.04).
          o Fix GTK+ depreciation warnings.
          o Fix crash on Ubuntu (only seen on BleachBit as packaged in the Ubuntu repository).
          o Remove translations from RHEL 5.0 and CentOS 5.0 because their ancient gettext version 0.14 does not support translation contexts.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- Specific to Linux
    * Clean Konqueror cache, history, and cookies.
    * Fix bug launching BleachBit as Administrator on Ubuntu and Debian.
    * Improve the completion notification: do not show if the BleachBit application window is in focus, and if it is not, automatically remove the notification after 10 seconds.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov  9 20:33:38 UTC 2009 - saigkill@opensuse.org

- The following changes have been made since 0.7.0:
    * When clicking File - Shred, default to the home directory instead of a system directory.
    * Improve the usability of the security warning dialog (typically only seen in portable mode).
    * Improve the appearance of the preferences dialog on some non-English languages.
    * Do not include the tests as part of the standard installation to save disk space.
    * Specific to Linux
      o After taking longer than 10 seconds to finish, show a non-intrusive notification.
      o Fix handling of filenames with invalid encoding that could have caused an application freeze.
      o Add warning for Nautilus.
      o Delete Apache logs (thanks to Roman Horník)
      o Clean more of Emesene 1.0 cache (thanks to Danilo Piazzalunga)
      o Bonus pack
        + Fix system logs cleaner
        + Clean XBMC Media Center (thanks to Roman Horník)

- updated to version 0.6.5
- Since 0.6.4:
  * Vacuum Google Chrome
  * Delete Google Chrome 3's history
  * Clean Emesene cache

  * Add a portable package for Windows
  * Update 18 translations
  * Fix bugs
  * Expand the unit tests significantly
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 21 10:57:58 UTC 2009 - saigkill@opensuse.org

- updaded to version 0.6.4
- The following changes are included since 0.6.3:
    * Add command line interface. Often requested as a new feature, the command line interface lets you invoke BleachBit from scripts, cron, batch files, or the Windows Task Scheduler. For example, BleachBit can automatically vacuum Firefox each night or each time you login.
    * At the end of the log, show how many files were deleted, how many special operations were performed, and how many errors occurred, if any. Before only the size was shown.
    * When you close BleachBit while it is wiping free disk space, BleachBit will now quickly stop wiping free disk space.
    * When manually shredding files (by clicking File - Shred Files), BleachBit now ignores the related preference regarding overwriting files.
    * Make BleachBit easier to port to other POSIX systems such as NetBSD. (BleachBit is already available in NetBSD.)
    * Fix two spelling typos.
    * Fix small bugs.
    * Improve unit tests.
    * Specific to Linux
      o Honour GNOME appearance settings for toolbars (text below icon, icon only, etc).
      o Fix Yum error checking for non-English languages.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug 28 19:18:55 UTC 2009 - saigkill@opensuse.org

- updated to version 0.6.3
- The following changes are included since 0.6.1:
    * More thoroughly wipe free disk space. BleachBit now tries to wipe inodes on Linux and the NTFS MFT (Master File Table) on Windows to hide metadata of deleted files. The metadata includes details such as the filename, file size, and modification date. Initial testing shows this is effective on ext3 (the most common Linux filesystem), ext4, and Microsoft's NTFS.
    * In case of certain errors deleting a file or directory, BleachBit will no longer skip other files that can be deleted.
    * Specific to Windows
      o Delete Windows system log files.
      o Delete Microsoft Office 2007 diagnostic log files.
      o Don't stop deleting when a directory cannot be removed because it is not empty.
      o Include better links in Control Panel's Add/Remove Programs.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 17 19:02:39 UTC 2009 - saigkill@opensuse.org

- updated to Version 0.6.1
- The following changes are included since 0.6.0:
    * Overwrite free disk space. Files are deleted "insecurely" in four typical situations: in BleachBit with shredding disabled, with certain BleachBit operations that don't support shredding, with filesystems that don't support shredding, and most deletions outside of BleachBit. These files can often be undeleted. Even if you use the Linux ext3 filesystem, for example, which doesn't support undelete, the file contents can sometimes still be recovered with only moderate technical skill. The new BleachBit option overwrites all the free space to prevent recovery.
      Besides privacy, a popular use for wiping free space is dramatically increasing compression ratios for archiving whole disk images ("ghost" backups) and virtual machines.
      Before using the option, check its settings in the preferences menu. This option is slow: each gigabyte of free takes 15 seconds on my machine.
    * When shredding files manually (from the file menu), show a preview and a list of those that were actually deleted.
    * When confirming delete, treat closing the confirmation dialog the same as cancelling.
    * Cleanup code.
    * Specific to Linux
      o Vacuum the gPodder SQLite database and delete the cache thanks to shane.fox.
      o Erase Nautilus usage history thanks to MixCool. Specifically, this cleaner deletes the saved session files and "metafiles." Besides taking a fair amount of space, these XML files record usage activity as a side effect of tracking Nautilus window positions and emblems. You may be surprised what this cleaner uncovers.
      o Work around a bug in GNOME 2.26, so the recent documents list can be deleted.
      o Vacuum the Yum SQLite databases (for Fedora, Red Hat, CentOS).
      o When running yum clean all enable all repositories.
      o Require package python-xml on OpenSUSE 11.1 (reported by rvpittman).
