Wed May 18 12:39:25 UTC 2022 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 1.3.1:
  + Fixed an overflow issue in `bowtie-build` that would sometimes
    yield corrupt "large" (64-bit) indexes; the resulting index
    would sometimes cause `bowtie` to hang. Note: `bowtie2-build`
    does not have this issue.
  + Fixed an issue in `bowtie` causing XM:i SAM optional field to
    sometimes be off by 1 when using the `-m/-M` flags.
  + Fixed an issue that would sometimes cause deadlocks in `bowtie`
    when running multithreaded.
  + Fixed an issue causing build errors when compiling against
    a pre-C++11 standard.

- Update to 1.3.0:
  * Fixed an issue causing bowtie to report incorrect results
    when using a Bowtie 2 index.
  * New, more efficient implementation of --reorder for
    keeping SAM output lines in same order as input reads
  * Added -x parameter for specifying index. bowtie still
    supports specifying an index via positional parameter,
    but this behavior will be deprecated.
  * Migrated python scripts to python3.
  * Fully removed colorspace functionality.
  * Added support for compiling on ARM architectures.
  * Fixed an issue preventing bowtie from outputting newlines
    in --max and --un output files.
  * Fixed an issue causing alignment results to vary based
    on read names.
  * Fixed an issue preventing --no-unal from suppressing
    unmapped reads.
  * Removed dependence on some third-party libraries,
    simplifying the code and improving portability.
  * Fix an issue preventing bowtie from running with
    many threads on big-endian machines.
- Spec cleanup

    FASTA.
  * Fixed issue preventing bowtie from reporting repeated
    alignments when -M is specified.
  * Fixed issue with -F mode omitting final base of each read.

    first.
  * Fixed an issue preventing bowtie wrapper script from finding
    indexes.
