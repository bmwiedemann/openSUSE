- Update to 1.3.0:
  * Fixed an issue causing bowtie to report incorrect results
    when using a Bowtie 2 index.
  * New, more efficient implementation of --reorder for
    keeping SAM output lines in same order as input reads
  * Added -x parameter for specifying index. bowtie still
    supports specifying an index via positional parameter,
    but this behavior will be deprecated.
  * Migrated python scripts to python3.
  * Fully removed colorspace functionality.
  * Added support for compiling on ARM architectures.
  * Fixed an issue preventing bowtie from outputting newlines
    in --max and --un output files.
  * Fixed an issue causing alignment results to vary based
    on read names.
  * Fixed an issue preventing --no-unal from suppressing
    unmapped reads.
  * Removed dependence on some third-party libraries,
    simplifying the code and improving portability.
  * Fix an issue preventing bowtie from running with
    many threads on big-endian machines.
