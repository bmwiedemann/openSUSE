%description
Bowtie is an ultrafast, memory-efficient short read aligner. It aligns short
DNA sequences (reads) to the human genome at a rate of over 25 million 35-bp
reads per hour. Bowtie indexes the genome with a Burrows-Wheeler index to keep
its memory footprint small: typically about 2.2 GB for the human genome
(2.9 GB for paired-end).
