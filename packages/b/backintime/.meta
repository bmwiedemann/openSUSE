  <description>Back In Time is a simple backup system for GNOME/KDE4 desktop inspired from
&quot;flyback project&quot; and &quot;TimeVault&quot;. The backup is done by taking snapshots
of a specified set of directories.

All you have to do is configure:

	* Where to save snapshot
	* What directories to backup
	* When backup should be done (manual,
	  every hour, every day, every week, every month)</description>
