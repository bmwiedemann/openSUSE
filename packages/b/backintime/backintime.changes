Wed Jun 26 02:20:01 UTC 2024 - Tejas Guruswamy <tejas.guruswamy@opensuse.org>

- Remove backintime-polkit_priv_downgrade.patch, not needed (boo#1226446)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jun  8 18:01:16 UTC 2024 - Tejas Guruswamy <tejas.guruswamy@opensuse.org>

- Update to 1.4.3
  * Feature: Exclude 'SingletonLock' and 'SingletonCookie' (Discord) and 'lock' (Mozilla Firefox) files by default (part of #1555)
  * Work around: Relax `rsync` exit code 23: Ignore instead of error now (part of #1587)
  * Feature (experimental): Add new snapshot log filter `rsync transfer failures (experimental)` to find them easier (they are normally not shown as "error").
                            This feature is experimental because it is based on hard-coded error message strings in the rsync source code
                            and may possibly not find all rsync messages or show false positives.
  * Fix bug: 'qt5_probing.py' hangs when BiT is run as root and no user is logged into a desktop environment (#1592 and #1580)
  * Fix bug: Launching BiT GUI (root) hangs on Wayland without showing the GUI (#836)
  * Improve: Launcher for BiT GUI (root) does not enforce Wayland anymore but uses same settings as for BiT GUI (userland) (#1350)
  * Fix bug: Disabling suspend during taking a backup ("inhibit suspend") hangs when BiT is run as root and no user is logged into a desktop environment (#1592)
  * Change of semantics: BiT running as root never disables suspend during taking a backup ("inhibit suspend") even though this may have worked before in BiT <= v1.4.1 sometimes (required to fix #1592)
  * Fix bug: RTE: module 'qttools' has no attribute 'initate_translator' with encFS when prompting the user for a password (#1553).
  * Fix bug: Schedule dropdown menu used "minutes" instead of "hours".
  * Fix bug: Unhandled exception "TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not callable" in tools.py function __log_keyring_warning (#820).
             Logging thread removed and logger module correctly initialized as fix. Is "Heisenbug" so 100 % retesting was not possible.
  * Build: Use PyLint in unit testing to catch E1101 (no-member) errors.
  * Build: Activate PyLint warning W1401 (anomalous-backslash-in-string).
  * Build: Add codespell config.
  * Build: Allow manual specification of python executable (--python=PYTHON_PATH) in common/configure and qt/configure
  * Build: All starter scripts do use an absolute path to the python executable by default now via common/configure and qt/configure (#1574)
  * Build: Install dbus configuration file to /usr/share not /etc (#1596)
  * Build: `configure` does delete old installed files (`qt4plugin.py` and `net.launchpad.backintime.serviceHelper.conf`) that were renamed or moved in a previous release (#1596)
  * Translation: Minor modifications in source strings and updating language files.
  * Refactor: Solved circular dependency between tools.py and logger.py to fix #820
  * Improved: qtsystrayicon.py, qt5_probing.py, usercallbackplugin.py and all parts of app.py
              do now also use "backintime" as logging namespace in the syslog to ensure complete log output with `journalctl | grep -i backintime`

- update to 1.4.1:
  * Dependency: Add "qt translations" to GUI runtime dependencies (gh#bit-team/backintime#1538)
  * Build: Unit tests do generically ignore all instead of well-known warnings now (gh#bit-team/backintime#1539).
  * Build: Warnings about missing Qt translation now are ignored while testing (gh#bit-team/backintime#1537).
  * Fix bug: GUI didn't start when "show hidden files" button was on (gh#bit-team/backintime#1535).
- update to 1.4.0:
  * Project: Renamed branch "master" to "main" and started "gitflow" branching
    model.
  * Refactor: Renamed qt4plugin.py to systrayiconplugin.py (we are using Qt5
    for years now ;-)
  * Refactor: Removed unfinished feature "Full system backup" (gh#bit-team/backintime#1526)
  * Fix bug: AttributeError: can't set attribute 'showHiddenFiles' in app.py (gh#bit-team/backintime#1532)

    (gh#bit-team/backintime#1386)
  * Fix bug: Unit test fails on some machines due to warning "Ignoring
    XDG_SESSION_TYPE=wayland on Gnome..." (gh#bit-team/backintime#1429)
  * Fix bug: Generation of config-manpage caused an error with Debian's Lintian (gh#bit-team/backintime#1398).
  * Fix bug: Return empty list in smartRemove (gh#bit-team/backintime#1392,
    Debian Bug Report 973760)
  * Fix bug: Taking a snapshot reports rsync errors now even if no snapshot was
    taken (gh#bit-team/backintime#1491)
  * Fix bug: takeSnapshot() recognizes errors now by also evaluating the rsync
    exit code (gh#bit-team/backintime#489)
  * Fixes related problem: Killing rsync was not handled gracefully (by

  * Fix bug: The error user-callback is now always called if an error happened
    while taking a snapshot (gh#bit-team/backintime#1491)
  * Fix bug: D-Bus serviceHelper error "LimitExceeded: Maximum length of
    command line reached (100)":

    of gh#bit-team/backintime#1491):

    6: New snapshot taken but with errors.
  * Feature: The rsync exit code is now contained in the snapshot log (part
    of gh#bit-team/backintime#489). Example:
    [E] Error: 'rsync' ended with exit code -9 (negative values are signal numbers, see 'kill -l')
  * Fix bug: Treat rsync exit code 24 as INFO instead of ERROR (gh#bit-team/backintime#1506)
  * Breaking change: Minimal Python version 3.8 required (gh#bit-team/backintime#1358).

  * Build: Introduced .readthedocs.yaml as asked by ReadTheDocs.org (gh#bit-team/backintime#1443).
  * Dependency: The oxygen icons should be installed with the BiT Qt GUI since
  * they are used as fallback in case of missing icons
  * Fix bug: Add support for ChainerBackend class as keyring which iterates
    over all supported keyring backends (gh#bit-team/backintime#1410)
  * Translation: Strings to translate now easier to understand for translators
    (gh#bit-team/backintime#1448, gh#bit-team/backintime#1457,
    gh#bit-team/backintime#1462, gh#bit-team/backintime#1465).

  Upstream changelog:

    * Fix bug: remove x-terminal-emulator dependency (#515)
    * Fix bug: AttributeError in About Dialog (#515)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 11 14:31:31 UTC 2016 - ronisbr@gmail.com

- backintime-qt4 uses x-terminal-emulator to open a terminal with a
  man page in the menus Help->Help and Help->Config File Help.
  However, openSUSE does not have x-terminal-emulator, instead it
  has xdg-terminal that does not work because it can only accept
  one argument. Thus, the solution was to replace
  x-terminal-emulator with xterm. Now, everything in the Help menu
  is working properly.

Wed Sep 16 16:17:03 UTC 2015 - ronisbr@gmail.com

-  Version bump to 1.1 branch (1.1.6), based on home:ecsos:Backup/backintime.
    * The 1.1 branch introduced a new QT4 GUI that replaced the
      old KDE and GNOME GUI. Therefore, the pacakges backintime-gnome and
      backintime-kde were replaced by the package backintime-qt4. Thus, both
      backintime and backintime-qt4 do not depend on any GNOME or KDE packages
      anymore.
    * The package now depends on python3 instead of python. 
    * The patch `backintime-ssh-agent_only_if_password.patch` was
      updated to replace TABs with SPACEs for code indentation following the
      convention of `common/sshtools.py`.

- Upstream changelog from version 1.0.38 to version 1.1.6.

    Version 1.1.6
        * show Profile name in systrayicon menu
