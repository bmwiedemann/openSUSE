  <title>A BitTorrent file system based on FUSE</title>
  <description>With BTFS, you can mount any .torrent file or magnet link and then use it as any read-only directory in your file tree. The contents of the files will be downloaded on-demand as they are read by applications. Tools like ls, cat and cp work as expected. Applications like media players can also work without changes.</description>
