%description
With BTFS, you can mount any .torrent file or magnet link and then use it as
any read-only directory in your file tree. The contents of the files will be
downloaded on-demand as they are read by applications. Tools like ls, cat and
cp work as expected. Applications like media players can also work without changes.
