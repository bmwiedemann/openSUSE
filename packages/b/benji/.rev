    <comment>- Update to 0.4.0:
  * Documentation updates
  * Added new CLI command benji storage-stats to get storage usage information
  * Fixed backup progress reporting on console
  * Added fdatasync() calls to the file module to ensure backup integrity
    in case of a system crash or a power failure (will impact performance when using the file I/O module)
  * Speed up command line completion
  * Added benji completion CLI command</comment>

    <comment>- Update to 0.6.0:
  * URL parsing of I/O resources is now conforming to standards.
    Especially for the RBD I/O module the two slashes directly after
    the colon are no longer valid and have to be removed
    (rbd://pool/image -&gt; rbd:pool/image).
  * Added I/O module for iSCSI. It is based on libiscsi and requires
    no elevated permissions. Please see the documentation as Benji
    requires a special version of the libiscsi Python bindings.
    The module is single-threaded and synchronous, so performance
    will be limited. Contributions are welcome!
  * The algorithm used by benji enforce has seen an overhaul and
    should be more comprehensible as the time categories are based
    on natural time boundaries (start of the hour, day, week,
    month, and year) now.
  * Added a restore helper script (images/benji-k8s/scripts/benji-restore-pvc)
    for Kubernetes. This script is intended to be run on a management
    system with access to the Kubernetes cluster and can restore
    a version into a new or an existing PVC/PV pair.
  * The container images are now based on the Python 3.6 included in EPEL.
    The RBD support has been updated to Ceph Nautilus. Nautilus also
    added RADOS and RBD Python bindings for Python 3.6 which are now
    used instead of building them themselves.
- Add requires on python3-diskcache

- Update to 0.5.0:
  * Added fsfreeze support to the benji-k8s Docker image. Just add
    the benji-backup.me/fsfreeze: yes annotation to the PVC.
    Kubernetes hosts are accessed via pods which are deployed by
    a DaemonSet, see the Helm chart for details.
  * Use bulk inserts to speed up backups of images based on a</comment>

    <comment>- Update to 0.7.0:
  * Added a new I/O module rbdaio which uses the asynchronous API of librbd.
    Performance results in relation to rbd have been mixed but performance
	should be at least 10-20% higher on restore. In one case performance has
	been increased tenfold.
  * Almost all Bash helper scripts have been rewritten in Python.
    The new scripts are calling Benji via the command line just like before.
	This is intentional to minimize the interdependence between Benji and these
	helpers. The scripts are examples only and not part of the API.
	There still is one example Bash script at scripts/ceph.sh to show how to
	interact with Benji via Bash. The helpers have additional dependencies
	which can be installed with pip install benji[helpers].
  * The Prometheus metrics exported by benji-k8s have changed:
  * Backup metrics now longer include the auxiliary_data label.
  * Command metrics now longer include the arguments label. The arguments
    have been folded into the command label.
  * benji-k8s: The included scripts have been replaced by Python scripts and
    are using the new helper modules. They should be calling compatible.
  * benji-k8s: All calls to kubectl have been replaced with direct API requests.
    The official Python client for Kubernetes is used. kubectl is still included
	in the image.
  * Helm chart: Volumes and volume mounts are now configurable via values.yaml.
    This is mostly for getting the Ceph credentials into the container but could
	also be used to mount file-based storage.
  * Helm chart: The PostgreSQL chart dependency was updated from 2.7.6 to 4.2.2.
    This is the last chart which uses PostgreSQL 10 and requires no upgrade of the
	database data structures.
  * benji-k8s and Helm chart: The image was simplified to only include the
    Kubernetes specific scripts and kubectl. Instead of running backups or other
	jobs via crond inside the container, the Helm chart now generates separate</comment>

    <comment>- Update to 0.7.1:
  * This release pins two package dependencies to older versions
    as newer releases of these dependencies broke Benji.
  * Fixes #49.
  * Fixes #51.</comment>
