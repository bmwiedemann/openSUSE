Tue Jun 23 10:50:11 UTC 2020 - Martin Pluskal <mpluskal@suse.com>

- Update to version 1.19.0:
  * The length of automatic blocksizes for fast codecs (lz4, blosclz) has been incremented quite a bit (up to 256 KB) for better compression ratios.
  * The performance in modern CPUs (with at least 256 KB in L2 cache) should be better too (for older CPUs the performance should stay roughly the same).
  * For small buffers that cannot be compressed (typically < 128 bytes), blosc_compress() returns now a 0 (cannot compress) instead of a negative number (internal error). See #294.
  * blosclz codec updated to 2.1.0. Expect better compression ratios and performance in a wider variety of scenarios.
  * blosc_decompress_unsafe(), blosc_decompress_ctx_unsafe() and blosc_getitem_unsafe() have been removed because they are dangerous and after latest improvements, they should not be used in production.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 31 09:39:10 UTC 2020 - Martin Pluskal <mpluskal@suse.com>

- Update to version 1.18.1:
  * Fixed the copy of the leftovers of a chunk when its size is not
    a multiple of the typesize.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb  6 14:40:25 UTC 2020 - Martin Pluskal <mpluskal@suse.com>

- Update to version 1.17.1:
  * BloscLZ codec updated to 2.0.0.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun  4 10:38:33 UTC 2019 - Martin Pluskal <mpluskal@suse.com>

- Update to version 1.16.3:
  * Fix for building for clang with -march=haswell. See PR #262.
  * Fix all the known warnings for GCC/Clang. Still some work to do for MSVC in this front.
  * Due to some problems with several CI systems, the check for library symbols are deactivated now by default. If you want to enforce this check, use: cmake .. -DDEACTIVATE_SYMBOLS_CHECK=ON to re-activate it.
  * Correct the check for the compressed size when the buffer is memcpyed. This was a regression introduced in 1.16.0. Fixes #261.
  * Fixed a regression in 1.16.0 that prevented to compress empty buffers (see #260).
  * Now the functions that execute Blosc decompressions are safe by default for untrusted/possibly corrupted inputs.
  * The previous functions (with less safety) checks are still available with a '_unsafe' suffix. The complete list is:
  * Also, a new API function named blosc_cbuffer_validate(), for validating Blosc compressed data, has been added.
  * For details, see PR #258. Thanks to Jeremy Maitin-Shepard.
  * Fixed a bug in blosc_compress() that could lead to thread deadlock under some situations. See #251. Thanks to @wenjuno for the report and the fix.
  * Fix data race in shuffle.c host_implementation initialization. Fixes #253. Thanks to Jeremy Maitin-Shepard.
  * Add workaround for Visual Studio 2008's lack of a stdint.h file to blosclz.c.
  * Replaced //-comments with /**/-comments and other improvements for compatibility with quite old gcc compilers. See PR #243. Thanks to Andreas Martin.
  * Empty buffers can be compressed again (this was unadvertedly prevented while fixing #234). See #247. Thanks to Valentin Haenel.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug 21 12:53:41 UTC 2018 - mpluskal@suse.com

- Update to version 1.14.4:
  * Added a new DEACTIVATE_SSE2 option for cmake that is useful for
    disabling SSE2 when doing cross-compilation (see #236).
  * New check for detecting output buffers smaller than
    BLOSC_MAX_OVERHEAD.
  * The complib and version parameters for blosc_get_complib_info()
    can be safely set to NULL now. This allows to call this
    function even if the user is not interested in these parameters
    (so no need to reserve memory for them).
  * In some situations that a supposedly blosc chunk is passed to
    blosc_decompress(), one might end with an Arithmetic exception.
    This is probably due to the chunk not being an actual blosc
    chunk, and divisions by zero might occur. A protection has been
    added for this.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr 13 08:55:13 UTC 2018 - mpluskal@suse.com

- Update to version 1.14.3:
  * Fixed a bug that caused C-Blosc to crash on platforms
    requiring strict alignment.
  * Fixed a piece of code that was not C89 compliant.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb  6 11:50:55 UTC 2018 - mpluskal@suse.com

- Update to version 1.13.5:
  * Fixed a buffer overrun that happens when compressing small
    buffers and len(destination_buffer) < (len(source_buffer) +
    BLOSC_MAX_OVERHEAD). Reported by Ivan Smirnov.
  * Tests work now when external compressors are located in
    non-system locations. Fixes #210. Thanks to Leif Walsh.
  * Fixed a bug uncovered by the python-blosc test suite: when a
    buffer is to be copied, then we should reserve space for the
    header, not block pointers.
  * Serious optimization of memory copy functions (see new
    blosc/fastcopy.c). This benefits the speed of all the codecs,
    but specially the BloscLZ one. As a result of the above, the
    BloscLZ codec received a new adjustment of knobs so that you
    should expect better compression ratios with it too.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec 28 23:10:53 UTC 2017 - jengelh@inai.de

- Fix RPM group. Compact descriptions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Dec 24 18:33:04 UTC 2017 - mpluskal@suse.com

- Update to version 1.12.1:
  * Backported BloscLZ parameters that were fine-tuned for
    C-Blosc2.
- Packaging changes:
  * Run spec-clener
  * Use shared libraries with compression codecs instead of bundled
    ones
  * Use more of cmake macros
  * Build in parallel

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr 18 15:18:18 UTC 2017 - toddrme2178@gmail.com

- Update to 1.11.2
  - Enabled use as a CMake subproject, exporting shared & static library targets
    for super-projects to use. See PRs #178, #179 and #180.  Thanks to Kevin
    Murray.
  - Internal LZ4 codec updated to 1.7.5.
  - Internal Zstd codec updated to 1.1.2.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep 16 15:06:34 UTC 2016 - toddrme2178@gmail.com

- Update to 1.11.1
  - Fixed a bug introduced in 1.11.0 and discovered by pandas test suite. This
    basically prevented to decompress buffers compressed with previous versions of
    C-Blosc. See: https://github.com/Blosc/python-blosc/issues/115
- Update to 1.11.0
  - Internal Zstd codec upgraded to 1.0.0.
  - New block size computation inherited from C-Blosc2. Benchmarks are saying that
    this benefits mainly to LZ4, LZ4HC, Zlib and Zstd codecs, both in speed and in
    compression ratios (although YMMV for your case).
  - Added the @rpath flag in Mac OSX for shared libraries.  Fixes #175.
  - Added a fix for VS2008
  - License changed from MIT to 3-clause BSD style.
- Update to 1.10.2
  - Force the use of --std=gnu99 when using gcc.  Fixes #174.
- Update to 1.10.1
  - Removed an inconsistent check for C11 (__STDC_VERSION__ >= 201112L and
    _ISOC11_SOURCE) as this seem to pose problems on compilers doing different
    things in this check (e.g. clang). See
    https://github.com/Blosc/bloscpack/issues/50.
- Update to 1.10.0
  - Initial support for Zstandard (0.7.4). Zstandard (or Zstd for short) is a new
    compression library that allows better compression than Zlib, but that works
    typically faster (and some times much faster), making of it a good match for
    Blosc.
- Update to 1.9.3
  - Reverted a mistake introduced in 1.7.1.  At that time, bit-shuffling
    was enabled for typesize == 1 (i.e. strings), but the change also
    included byte-shuffling accidentally.  This only affected performance,
    but in a quite bad way (a copy was needed).  This has been fixed and
    byte-shuffling is not active when typesize == 1 anymore.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul  7 18:13:50 UTC 2016 - toddrme2178@gmail.com

- Update to 1.9.2
  * Check whether Blosc is actually initialized before blosc_init(),
    blosc_destroy() and blosc_free_resources().  This makes the library
    more resistant to different initialization cycles
    (e.g. https://github.com/stevengj/Blosc.jl/issues/19).
- Update to 1.9.1
  * The internal copies when clevel=0 are made now via memcpy().  At the
    beginning of C-Blosc development, benchmarks where saying that the
    internal, multi-threaded copies inside C-Blosc were faster than
    memcpy(), but 6 years later, memcpy() made greats strides in terms
    of efficiency.  With this, you should expect an slight speed
    advantage (10% ~ 20%) when C-Blosc is used as a replacement of
    memcpy() (which should not be the most common scenario out there).
  * Added a new DEACTIVATE_AVX2 cmake option to explicitly disable AVX2
    at build-time.  Thanks to James Bird.
  * The ``make -jN`` for parallel compilation should work now.  Thanks
    to James Bird.
- Update to 1.9.0
  * New blosc_get_nthreads() function to get the number of threads that
    will be used internally during compression/decompression (set by
    already existing blosc_set_nthreads()).
  * New blosc_get_compressor() function to get the compressor that will
    be used internally during compression (set by already existing
    blosc_set_compressor()).
  * New blosc_get_blocksize() function to get the internal blocksize to
    be used during compression (set by already existing
    blosc_set_blocksize()).
  * Now, when the BLOSC_NOLOCK environment variable is set (to any
    value), the calls to blosc_compress() and blosc_decompress() will
    call blosc_compress_ctx() and blosc_decompress_ctx() under the hood
    so as to avoid the internal locks.  See blosc.h for details.  This
    allows multi-threaded apps calling the non _ctx() functions to avoid
    the internal locks in C-Blosc.  For the not multi-threaded app
    though, it is in general slower to call the _ctx() functions so the
    use of BLOSC_NOLOCK is discouraged.
  * In the same vein, from now on, when the BLOSC_NTHREADS environment
    variable is set to an integer, every call to blosc_compress() and
    blosc_decompress() will call blosc_set_nthreads(BLOSC_NTHREADS)
    before the actuall compression/decompression process.  See blosc.h
    for details.
  * Finally, if BLOSC_CLEVEL, BLOSC_SHUFFLE, BLOSC_TYPESIZE and/or
    BLOSC_COMPRESSOR variables are set in the environment, these will be
    also honored before calling blosc_compress().
  * Calling blosc_init() before any other Blosc call, although
    recommended, is not necessary anymore.  The idea is that you can use
    just the basic blosc_compress() and blosc_decompress() and control
    other parameters (nthreads, compressor, blocksize) by using
    environment variables (see above).
- Update to 1.8.1
  * Disable the use of __builtin_cpu_supports() for GCC 5.3.1
    compatibility.
- Update to 1.8.0
  * The code is (again) compatible with VS2008 and VS2010.  This is
    important for compatibility with Python 2.6/2.7/3.3/3.4.
  * Introduced a new global lock during blosc_decompress() operation.
    As the blosc_compress() was already guarded by a global lock, this
    means that the compression/decompression is again thread safe.
    However, when using C-Blosc from multi-threaded environments, it is
    important to keep using the *_ctx() functions for performance
    reasons.  NOTE: _ctx() functions will be replaced by more powerful
    ones in C-Blosc 2.0.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar  9 21:35:59 UTC 2016 - toddrme2178@gmail.com

- Update to 1.7.1
  * Fixed a bug preventing bitshuffle to work correctly on getitem().
    Now, everything with bitshuffle seems to work correctly.
  * Fixed the thread initialization for blosc_decompress_ctx().  Issue
    #158.  Thanks to Chris Webers.
  * Fixed a bug in the blocksize computation introduced in 1.7.0.  This
    could have been creating segfaults.
  * Allow bitshuffle to run on 1-byte typesizes.
  * New parametrization of the blocksize to be independent of the
    typesize.  This allows a smoother speed throughout all typesizes.
  * lz4 and lz4hc codecs upgraded to 1.7.2 (from 1.7.0).
  * When calling set_nthreads() but not actually changing the number of
    threads in the internal pool does not teardown and setup it anymore.
    PR #153.  Thanks to Santi Villalba.
- Update to 1.7.0
  * Added a new 'bitshuffle' filter so that the shuffle takes place at a
    bit level and not just at a byte one, which is what it does the
    previous 'shuffle' filter.
  * New acceleration mode for LZ4 and BloscLZ codecs that enters in
    operation with complevel < 9.  This allows for an important boost in
    speed with minimal compression ratio loss.  Francesc Alted.
  * LZ4 codec updated to 1.7.0 (r130).
  * PREFER_EXTERNAL_COMPLIBS cmake option has been removed and replaced
    by the more fine grained PREFER_EXTERNAL_LZ4, PREFER_EXTERNAL_SNAPPY
    and PREFER_EXTERNAL_ZLIB.  In order to allow the use of the new API
    introduced in LZ4 1.7.0, PREFER_EXTERNAL_LZ4 has been set to OFF by
    default, whereas PREFER_EXTERNAL_SNAPPY and PREFER_EXTERNAL_ZLIB
    continues to be ON.
  * Implemented SSE2 shuffle support for buffers containing a number of
    elements which is not a multiple of (typesize * vectorsize).  Jack
    Pappas.
  * Added SSE2 shuffle/unshuffle routines for types larger than 16
    bytes.  Jack Pappas.
  * 'test_basic' suite has been split in components for a much better
    granularity on what's a possibly failing test.  Also, lots of new
    tests have been added.  Jack Pappas.
  * Fixed compilation on non-Intel archs (tested on ARM).  Zbyszek
    Szmek.
  * Modifyied cmake files in order to inform that AVX2 on Visual Studio
    is supported only in 2013 update 2 and higher.
  * Added a replacement for stdbool.h for Visual Studio < 2013.
  * blosclz codec adds Win64/Intel as a platform supporting unaligned
    addressing.  That leads to a speed-up of 2.2x in decompression.
  * New blosc_get_version_string() function for retrieving the version
    of the c-blosc library.  Useful when linking with dynamic libraries
    and one want to know its version.
  * New example (win-dynamic-linking.c) that shows how to link a Blosc
    DLL dynamically in run-time (Windows only).
  * The `context.threads_started` is initialized now when decompressing.
    This could cause crashes in case you decompressed before compressing
    (e.g. directly deserializing blosc buffers).  @atchouprakov.
  * The HDF5 filter has been removed from c-blosc and moved into its own
    repo at: https://github.com/Blosc/hdf5
  * The MS Visual Studio 2008 has been tested with c-blosc for ensuring
    compatibility with extensions for Python 2.6 and up.

Tue May 19 10:23:41 UTC 2015 - toddrme2178@gmail.com

- Update to version 1.6.1:
  * Fixed a subtle, but long-standing bug in the blosclz codec that
    could potentially overwrite an area beyond the output buffer.
  * Support for runtime detection of AVX2 and SSE2 SIMD
    instructions, allowing running AVX2 capable c-blosc libraries
    to run on machines with no AVX2 available (will use SSE2 
    instead).
  * A new blocksize computation allows for better compression 
    ratios for larger typesizes (> 8 bytes), without not penalizing
    the speed too much (at least on modern CPUs).
- changes from version 1.6.0:
  * Support for AVX2 is here!  The benchmarks with a 4-core Intel
    Haswell machine tell that both compression and decompression are
    accelerated around a 10%, reaching peaks of 9.6 GB/s during
    compression and 26 GB/s during decompression (memcpy() speed for
    this machine is 7.5 GB/s for writes and 11.7 GB/s for reads).
    Many thanks to @littlezhou for this nice work.
  * Support for HPET (high precision timers) for the `bench` program.
    This is particularly important for microbenchmarks like bench is
    doing; since they take so little time to run, the granularity of a
    less-accurate timer may account for a significant portion of the
    runtime of the benchmark itself, skewing the results.  Thanks to
    Jack Pappas.
- changes from version 1.5.4:
  * Updated to LZ4 1.6.0 (r128).
  * Fix resource leak in t_blosc.  Jack Pappas.
  * Better checks during testing.  Jack Pappas.
  * Dynamically loadable HDF5 filter plugin. Kiyo Masui.
- changes from version 1.5.3:
  * Use llabs function (where available) instead of abs to avoid
    truncating the result.  Jack Pappas.
  * Use C11 aligned_alloc when it's available.  Jack Pappas.
  * Use the built-in stdint.h with MSVC when available.  Jack Pappas.
  * Only define the __SSE2__ symbol when compiling with MS Visual C++
    and targeting x64 or x86 with the correct /arch flag set. This
    avoids re-defining the symbol which makes other compilers issue
    warnings.  Jack Pappas.
  * Reinitializing Blosc during a call to set_nthreads() so as to fix
    problems with contexts.  Francesc Alted.
- changes from version 1.5.2:
  * Using blosc_compress_ctx() / blosc_decompress_ctx() inside the
    HDF5 compressor for allowing operation in multiprocess scenarios.
    See: https://github.com/PyTables/PyTables/issues/412

    The drawback of this quick fix is that the Blosc filter will be only
    able to use a single thread until another solution can be devised.
- changes from version 1.5.1:
  * Updated to LZ4 1.5.0.  Closes #74.
  * Added the 'const' qualifier to non SSE2 shuffle functions. Closes
    #75.
  * Explicitly call blosc_init() in HDF5 blosc_filter.c, fixing a
    segfault.
  * Quite a few improvements in cmake files for HDF5 support.  Thanks
    to Dana Robinson (The HDF Group).
  * Variable 'class' caused problems compiling the HDF5 filter with
    g++.  Thanks to Laurent Chapon.
  * Small improvements on docstrings of c-blosc main functions.
- changes from version  1.5.0:
  * Added new calls for allowing Blosc to be used *simultaneously*
    (i.e. lock free) from multi-threaded environments.  The new
    functions are:

    - blosc_compress_ctx(...)
    - blosc_decompress_ctx(...)

    See the new docstrings in blosc.h for how to use them.  The previous
    API should be completely unaffected.  Thanks to Christopher Speller.
  * Optimized copies during BloscLZ decompression.  This can make
    BloscLZ to decompress up to 1.5x faster in some situations.
  * LZ4 and LZ4HC compressors updated to version 1.3.1.
  * Added an examples directory on how to link apps with Blosc.
  * stdlib.h moved from blosc.c to blosc.h as suggested by Rob Lathm.
  * Fix a warning for {snappy,lz4}-free compilation.  Thanks to Andrew
    Schaaf.
  * Several improvements for CMakeLists.txt (cmake).
  * Fixing C99 compatibility warnings.  Thanks to Christopher Speller.

- Update to 1.4.1
  * Fixed a bug in blosc_getitem() introduced in 1.4.0.  Added a test for
    blosc_getitem() as well.
- Update to 1.4.0
  * Support for non-Intel and non-SSE2 architectures has been added.  In
    particular, the Raspberry Pi platform (ARM) has been tested and all
    tests pass here.
  * Architectures requiring strict access alignment are supported as well.
    Due to this, arquitectures with a high penalty in accessing unaligned
    data (e.g. Raspberry Pi, ARMv6) can compress up to 2.5x faster.
  * LZ4 has been updated to r119 (1.2.0) so as to fix a possible security
    breach.
- Update to 1.3.6
  * Updated to LZ4 r118 due to a (highly unlikely) security hole.  For
