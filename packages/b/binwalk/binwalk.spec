%description
Binwalk is a tool for searching a given binary image for embedded
files and executable code. Specifically, it is designed for
identifying files and code embedded inside of firmware images.
Binwalk uses the libmagic library, so it is compatible with magic
signatures created for the Unix file utility. Binwalk also includes
a custom magic signature file which contains improved signatures
for files that are commonly found in firmware images such as
compressed/archived files, firmware headers, Linux kernels,
bootloaders, filesystems, etc.
