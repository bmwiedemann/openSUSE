Sat Sep 17 12:04:02 UTC 2022 - Andreas Prittwitz <m4ng4n@gmx.de>

- Update to 1.2.2
- Update requirements: openssl-devel >= 1.1.0

  New features:
   * prune/delete --checkpoint-interval=1800 and ctrl-c/SIGINT
     support, #6284

  Fixes:
   * SaveFile: use a custom mkstemp with mode support, #6933,
     #6400, #6786. This fixes umask/mode/ACL issues (and also
     "chmod not supported" exceptions seen in 1.2.1) of files
   * updated using SaveFile, e.g. the repo config.
   * hashindex_compact: fix eval order (check idx before use),
     #5899
   * create --paths-from-(stdin|command): normalize paths, #6778
   * secure_erase: avoid collateral damage, #6768. If a hardlink
     copy of a repo was made and a new repo config shall be
     saved, do NOT fill in random garbage before deleting the
     previous repo config, because that would damage the hardlink
     copy.
   * list: fix {flags:<WIDTH>} formatting, #6081
   * check: try harder to create the key, #5719
   * misc commands: ctrl-c must not kill other subprocesses, #6912
       borg create with a remote repo via ssh
       borg create --content-from-command
       borg create --paths-from-command
   * (de)compression filter process of import-tar / export-tar

  Other changes:
   * deprecate --prefix, use -a / --glob-archives, see #6806
   * make setuptools happy ("package would be ignored"), #6874
   * fix pyproject.toml to create a fixed _version.py file,
     compatible with both old and new setuptools_scm version,
     #6875
   * automate asciinema screencasts
   * CI: test on macOS 12 without fuse / fuse tests (too
     troublesome on github CI due to kernel extensions needed by
     macFUSE)
   * tests: fix test_obfuscate byte accounting
   * repository: add debug logging for issue #6687
   * _chunker.c: fix warnings on macOS
   * requirements.lock.txt: use the latest cython 0.29.32

  docs:
   * add info on man page installation, #6894
   * update archive_progress json description about
     "finished", #6570
   * json progress_percent: some values are optional, #4074
   * FAQ: full quota / full disk, #5960
   * correct shell syntax for installation using git

- Fix package %checks
- the tests
  test_progress_percentage_sameline and test_progress_percentage_step
  seem to do work again

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jun 25 10:18:14 UTC 2022 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update requirements
  * Be very specific with python3-msgpack: This prevents users to
    upgrade their Tumbleweed system with an incompatible version
  * Clean up

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun 24 11:06:59 UTC 2022 - Andreas Prittwitz <m4ng4n@gmx.de>

- Update to 1.2.1
  Compatibility notes:

   * matching of path patterns has been aligned with borg storing
     relative paths. Borg archives file paths without leading
     slashes. Previously, include/exclude patterns could contain
     leading slashes. You should check your patterns and remove
     leading slashes.

  Fixes:

   * create: skip with warning if opening the parent dir of
     recursion root fails, #6374
   * create: fix crash. metadata stream can produce all-zero
     chunks, #6587
   * fix crash when computing stats, escape % chars in archive
     name, #6500
   * fix transaction rollback: use files cache filename as found
     in txn.active/, #6353
   * import-tar: kill filter process in case of borg exceptions,
     #6401 #6681
   * import-tar: fix mtime type bug
   * ensure_dir: respect umask for created directory modes, #6400
   * SaveFile: respect umask for final file mode, #6400
   * check archive: improve error handling for corrupt archive
     metadata block, make robust_iterator more robust, #4777
   * pre12-meta cache: do not use the cache if want_unique is
     True, #6612
   * fix scp-style repo url parsing for ip v6 address, #6526
   * mount -o versions: give clear error msg instead of crashing.
     it does not make sense to request versions view if you only
     look at 1 archive, but the code shall not crash in that case
     as it did, but give a clear error msg.
   * show_progress: add finished=true/false to archive_progress
     json, #6570
   * delete/prune: fix --iec mode output (decimal vs.
     binary units), #6606
   * info: fix authenticated mode repo to show
     "Encrypted: No", #6462
   * diff: support presence change for blkdev, chrdev and fifo
     items, #6615

  New features:

   * delete: add repository id and location to prompt, #6453
   * borg debug dump-repo-objs --ghost: new --segment=S
     --offset=O options

  Other changes:

   * support python 3.11
   * allow msgpack 1.0.4, #6716
   * load_key: no key is same as empty key, #6441
   * give a more helpful error msg for unsupported key formats,
     #6561
   * better error msg for defect or unsupported repo configs, #6566
   * docs:
   * document borg 1.2 pattern matching behavior change, #6407
   * Make clear that absolute paths always go into the matcher as
     if they are relative (without leading slash). Adapt all
     examples accordingly.
   * authentication primitives: improved security and performance
     infos
   * mention BORG_FILES_CACHE_SUFFIX as alternative to
     BORG_FILES_CACHE_TTL, #5602
   * FAQ: add a hint about --debug-topic=files_cache
   * improve borg check --max-duration description
   * fix values of TAG bytes, #6515
   * borg compact --cleanup-commits also runs a normal compaction,
     #6324
   * virtualization speed tips
   * recommend umask for passphrase file perms
   * borg 1.2 is security supported
   * update link to ubuntu packages, #6485
   * use --numeric-ids in pull mode docs
   * remove blake2 docs, blake2 code not bundled any more, #6371
   * clarify on-disk order and size of segment file log
     entry fields, #6357
   * docs building: do not transform --/--- to unicode dashes
   * tests:
   * check that borg does not require pytest for normal usage,
     fixes #6563
   * fix OpenBSD symlink mode test failure, #2055
   * vagrant:
   * darwin64: remove fakeroot, #6314
   * update development.lock.txt
   * use pyinstaller 4.10 and python 3.9.13 for binary build
   * upgrade VMCPUS and xdistn from 4 to 16, maybe this speeds
     up the tests
   * crypto:
   * use hmac.compare_digest instead of ==, #6470
   * hmac_sha256: replace own cython wrapper code by hmac.digest
     python stdlib (since py38)
   * hmac and blake2b minor optimizations and cleanups
   * removed some unused crypto related code, #6472
   * avoid losing the key (potential use-after-free). this never
     could happen in 1.2 due to the way we use the code. The issue
     was discovered in master after other changes, so we also
     "fixed" it here before it bites us.
   * setup / build:
   * add pyproject.toml, fix sys.path, #6466
   * setuptools_scm: also require it via pyproject.toml
   * allow extra compiler flags for every extension build
   * fix misc. C / Cython compiler warnings, deprecation warnings
   * fix zstd.h include for bundled zstd, #6369
   * source using python 3.8 features:
     pyupgrade --py38-plus ./**/*.py

Wed Mar 30 10:44:18 UTC 2022 - Andreas Prittwitz <m4ng4n@gmx.de>

- Update to 1.2.0
  Compatibility notes:
   * dropped support / testing for older Pythons, minimum
     requirement is 3.8. In case your OS does not provide Python >=
     3.8, consider using our binary, which does not need an
     external Python interpreter. Or continue using borg 1.1.x,
     which is still supported.
   * freeing repository space only happens when "borg compact" is
     invoked.
   * mount: the default for --numeric-ids is False now (same as
     borg extract)
   * borg create --noatime is deprecated. Not storing atime is the
     default behaviour now (use --atime if you want to store the 
     atime).
   * list: corrected mix-up of "isomtime" and "mtime" formats.
     Previously, "isomtime" was the default but produced a verbose
     human format, while "mtime" produced a ISO-8601-like format.
     The behaviours have been swapped (so "mtime" is human,
     "isomtime" is ISO-like), and the default is now "mtime".
     "isomtime" is now a real ISO-8601 format ("T" between date and
     time, not a space).
   * create/recreate --list: file status for all files used to get
     announced AFTER the file (with borg < 1.2). Now, file status
     is announced BEFORE the file contents are processed. If the
     file status changes later (e.g. due to an error or a content
     change), the updated/final file status will be printed again.
   * removed deprecated-since-long stuff (deprecated since):
     command "borg change-passphrase" (2017-02), use "borg key ..."
     option "--keep-tag-files" (2017-01), use "--keep-exclude-tags"
     option "--list-format" (2017-10), use "--format"
     option "--ignore-inode" (2017-09), use "--files-cache" w/o "inode"
     option "--no-files-cache" (2017-09), use "--files-cache=disabled"
   * removed BORG_HOSTNAME_IS_UNIQUE env var. to use borg you must
     implement one of these 2 scenarios:
     the combination of FQDN and result of uuid.getnode() must be
     unique and stable (this should be the case for almost
     everybody, except when having duplicate FQDN and MAC address
     or all-zero MAC address) if you are aware that 1) is not the
     case for you, you must set BORG_HOST_ID env var to something
     unique.
   * exit with 128 + signal number, #5161. if you have scripts
     expecting rc == 2 for a signal exit, you need to update them
     to check for >= 128.

  Fixes:
   * diff: reduce memory consumption, fix is_hardlink_master, #6295
   * compact: fix / improve freeable / freed space log output
   * derive really freed space from quota use before/after, #5679
     do not say "freeable", but "maybe freeable" (based on hint,
     unsure)
   * fix race conditions in internal SaveFile function, #6306 #6028
   * implement internal safe_unlink (was: truncate_and_unlink)
     function more safely: usually it does not truncate any more,
     only under "disk full" circumstances and only if there is only
     one hardlink.
     see: https://github.com/borgbackup/borg/discussions/6286

  Other changes:
   * info: use a pre12-meta cache to accelerate stats for borg
     < 1.2 archives. the first time borg info is invoked on a
     borg 1.1 repo, it can take a rather long time computing and
     caching some stats values for 1.1 archives, which borg 1.2
     archives have in their archive metadata structure. be patient,
     esp. if you have lots of old archives. following invocations
     are much faster due to the cache. related change: add archive
     name to calc_stats progress display.
   * docs:
   * add borg 1.2 upgrade notes, #6217
   * link to borg placeholders and borg patterns help
   * init: explain the encryption modes better
   * clarify usage of patternfile roots
   * put import-tar docs into same file as export-tar docs
   * explain the difference between a path that ends with or
     without a slash, #6297

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul 13 10:42:13 UTC 2021 - Hans-Peter Jansen <hpj@urpla.net>

- Update to 1.1.17 (2021-07-12):
  Compatibility notes:
   * When upgrading from borg 1.0.x to 1.1.x, please note:
   * read all the compatibility notes for 1.1.0*, starting from
     1.1.0b1.
   * borg upgrade: you do not need to and you also should not run
     it.
   * borg might ask some security-related questions once after
     upgrading. You can answer them either manually or via
     environment variable. One known case is if you use unencrypted
     repositories, then it will ask about a unknown unencrypted
     repository one time.
   * your first backup with 1.1.x might be significantly slower (it
     might completely read, chunk, hash a lot files) - this is due
     to the –files-cache mode change (and happens every time you
     change mode). You can avoid the one-time slowdown by using the
     pre-1.1.0rc4-compatible mode (but that is less safe for
     detecting changed files than the default). See the –files-
     cache docs for details.
   * 1.1.11 removes WSL autodetection (Windows 10 Subsystem for
     Linux). If WSL still has a problem with sync_file_range, you
     need to set BORG_WORKAROUNDS=basesyncfile in the borg process
     environment to work around the WSL issue.
   * 1.1.14 changes return codes due to a bug fix: In case you have
     scripts expecting rc == 2 for a signal exit, you need to
     update them to check for >= 128 (as documented since long).
   * 1.1.15 drops python 3.4 support, minimum requirement is 3.5
     now.
   * 1.1.17 install_requires the “packaging” pypi package now.
  Fixes:
   * pyinstaller dir-mode: fix pyi detection / LIBPATH treatment,
     #5897
   * handle crash due to kill stale lock race, #5828
   * fix BORG_CACHE_DIR crashing borg if empty, #5216
   * create –dry-run: fix display of kept tagfile, #5834
   * fix missing parameter in “did not consistently fail” msg,
     #5822
   * missing / healed chunks: always tell chunk ID, #5704
   * benchmark: make sure cleanup happens even on exceptions, #5630
  New features:
   * implement BORG_SELFTEST env variable, #5871. this can be used
     to accelerate borg startup a bit. not recommended for normal
     usage, but borg mass hosters with a lot of borg invocations
     can save some resources with this. on my laptop, this saved
     ~100ms cpu time (sys+user) per borg command invocation.
   * implement BORG_LIBC env variable to give the libc filename,
     #5870. you can use this if a borg does not find your libc.
   * check: add progress indicator for archive check.
   * allow –files-cache=size (not recommended, make sure you know
     what you do)
  Other changes:
   * Python 3.10 now officially supported! we test on py310-dev on
     github CI since a while and now also on the vagrant machines,
     so it should work ok.
   * github CI: test on py310 (again)
   * get rid of distutils, use packaging and setuptools. distutils
     is deprecated and gives warnings on py 3.10.
   * setup.py: rename “clean” to “clean2” to avoid shadowing the
     “clean” command.
   * remove libc filename fallback for the BSDs (there is no
     “usual” name)
   * cleanup flake8 checks, fix some pep8 violations.
   * docs building: replace deprecated function “.add_stylesheet()”
     for Sphinx 4 compatibility
   * docs:
   * add a hint on sleeping computer and ssh connections, #5301
   * update the documentation on hacked backup client, #5480
   * improve docs/FAQ about append-only remote repos, #5497
   * complement the documentation for pattern files and exclude
     files, #5520
   * “filename with spaces” example added to exclude file, #5236
     note: no whitespace escaping needed, processed by borg.
   * add info on renaming repositories, #5240
   * clarify borg check –verify-data, #5808
   * add notice about defective hardware to check documentation,
     #5753
   * add paragraph added in #5855 to utility documentation source
   * add missing leading slashes in help patterns, #5857
   * clarify “you will need key and passphrase” borg init warning,
     #4622
   * pull mode: add some warnings, #5827
   * mention tar –compare (compare archive to fs files), #5880
   * fix typos, backport of #5597
   * vagrant:
   * add py3.7.11 for binary build, also add 3.10-dev.
   * use latest Cython 0.29.23 for py310 compat fixes.
   * more RAM for openindiana upgrade plan resolver, it just hangs
     (swaps?) if there is too little RAM.
   * fix install_pyenv to adapt to recent changes in pyenv (same as
     in master now).
   * use generic/netbsd9 box, copied from master branch.
- Reformatted Paolos last changelog
- Revert logic of borgbackup-1.1.16-fix-sphinx-api.patch: 
  borgbackup-1.1.17-old-sphinx-api.patch
- Allow to use old version of xxhash library (might crash on ARM),
  but an update is in enqueued

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul  2 10:55:47 UTC 2021 - Hans-Peter Jansen <hpj@urpla.net>

- Fix documentation generation with
  borgbackup-1.1.16-fix-sphinx-api.patch for Leap >= 15.3

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun May 16 10:33:52 UTC 2021 - ecsos <ecsos@opensuse.org>

- Remove the version from recommends pyfuse3,
  because it doesn't work in suse.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun May 16 07:57:17 UTC 2021 - ecsos <ecsos@opensuse.org>

- Use recommends pyfuse3 instead of llfuse for Tumbleweed.
  Upstream says use primary pyfuse3 and secondary llfuse.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Mar 28 08:29:53 UTC 2021 - Paolo Stivanin <info@paolostivanin.com>

- Update to 1.1.16:
  Fixes:
  * setup.py: add special openssl prefix for Apple M1
    compatibility
  * do not recurse into duplicate roots, #5603
  * remove empty shadowed_segments lists, #5275, #5614
  * fix libpython load error when borg fat binary / dir-based
    binary is invoked via a symlink by upgrading pyinstaller to
    v4.2, #5688
  * config: accept non-int value (like 500M or 100G) for
    max_segment_size or storage_quota, #5639. please note: when
    setting a non-int value for this in a repo config, using the
    repo will require borg >= 1.1.16.
  New features:
  * bundled msgpack: drop support for old buffer protocol to
    support Python 3.10
  * verbose files cache logging via --debug-topic=files_cache,
    #5659. Use this if you suspect that borg does not detect
    unmodified files as expected.
  * create/extract: add --noxattrs and --noacls option, #3955.
    when given with borg create, borg will not get xattrs / ACLs
    from input files (and thus, it will not archive xattrs / ACLs).
    when given with borg extract, borg will not read xattrs / ACLs
    from archive and will not set xattrs / ACLs on extracted files.
  * diff: add --json-lines option, #3765
  Other changes:
  * Tab completion support for additional archives for 'borg
    delete'
  * repository: deduplicate code of put and delete, no functional
    change
  Docs updates

Wed Dec 16 14:52:17 UTC 2020 - Paolo Stivanin <info@paolostivanin.com>

- Update to 1.1.14:
  Compatibility notes:
  * changes return codes due to a bug fix: In case you have scripts \
    expecting rc == 2 for a signal exit, you need to update them
    to check for >= 128 (as documented since long).
  Fixes:
  * check --repair: fix potential data loss when interrupting it, #5325
  * exit with 128 + signal number (as documented) when borg is killed by a signal, #5161
  * fix hardlinked CACHEDIR.TAG processing, #4911
  * create --read-special: .part files also should be regular files, #5217
  Other changes:
  * upgrade bundled xxhash to 0.7.4
  * prettier error message when archive gets too big
  * check/recreate are not "experimental" any more
    (but still potentially dangerous)
  * use "allow/deny list" instead of "white/black list" wording
  * update docs

      close to the top of this document.
    * upgrade bundled xxhash to 0.7.3, #4891 0.7.2 is the minimum requirement

Wed Mar 11 17:52:25 UTC 2020 - Paolo Stivanin <info@paolostivanin.com>

- fix building with python3 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct 31 11:20:34 UTC 2019 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Require python3-setuptools since it's needed when running borg
  to find the entry point (boo#1134650)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 23 09:40:02 UTC 2019 - Hans-Peter Jansen <hpj@urpla.net>

- Update to version 1.1.10 (2019-05-16)
  + Compatibility notes:
    * When upgrading from borg 1.0.x to 1.1.x, please note:
    * read all the compatibility notes for 1.1.0*, starting from
      1.1.0b1.
    * borg upgrade: you do not need to and you also should not run
      it.
    * borg might ask some security-related questions once after
      upgrading. You can answer them either manually or via
      environment variable. One known case is if you use
      unencrypted repositories, then it will ask about a unknown
      unencrypted repository one time.
    * your first backup with 1.1.x might be significantly slower
      (it might completely read, chunk, hash a lot files) - this is
      due to the --files-cache mode change (and happens every time
      you change mode). You can avoid the one-time slowdown by
      using the pre-1.1.0rc4-compatible mode (but that is less safe
      for detecting changed files than the default). See the
      --files-cache docs for details.
  + Fixes:
    * extract: hang on partial extraction with ssh: repo, when
      hardlink master is not matched/extracted and borg hangs on
      related slave hardlink, #4350
    * lrucache: regularly remove old FDs, #4427
    * avoid stale filehandle issues, #3265
    * freebsd: make xattr platform code api compatible with linux,
      #3952
    * use whitelist approach for borg serve, #4097
    * borg command shall terminate with rc 2 for ImportErrors,
      #4424
    * create: only run stat_simple_attrs() once, this increases
      backup with lots of unchanged files performance by ~ 5%.
    * prune: fix incorrect borg prune --stats output with --dry-
      run, #4373
    * key export: emit user-friendly error if repo key is exported
      to a directory, #4348
  + New features:
    * bundle latest supported msgpack-python release (0.5.6),
      remove msgpack-python from setup.py install_requires - by
      default we use the bundled code now. optionally, we still
      support using an external msgpack (see hints in setup.py),
      but this requires solid requirements management within
      distributions and is not recommended. borgbackup will break
      if you upgrade msgpack to an unsupported version.
    * display msgpack version as part of sysinfo (e.g. in
      tracebacks)
    * timestamp for borg delete --info added, #4359
    * enable placeholder usage in --comment and --glob-archives,
      #4559, #4495
  + Other:
    * serve: do not check python/libc for borg serve, #4483
    * shell completions: borg diff second archive
    * release scripts: signing binaries with Qubes OS support
    * testing:
    * vagrant: upgrade openbsd box to 6.4
    * travis-ci: lock test env to py 3.4 compatible versions, #4343
    * get rid of confusing coverage warning, #2069
    * rename test_mount_hardlinks to test_fuse_mount_hardlinks, so
      both can be excluded by "not test_fuse".
    * pure-py msgpack warning shall not make a lot of tests fail,
      #4558
    * docs:
    * add "SSH Configuration" section to "borg serve", #3988, #636,
      #4485
    * README: new URL for funding options
    * add a sample logging.conf in docs/misc, #4380
    * elaborate on append-only mode docs, #3504
    * installation: added Alpine Linux to distribution list, #4415
    * usage.html: only modify window.location when redirecting,
      #4133
    * add msgpack license to docs/3rd_party/msgpack
    * vagrant / binary builds:
    * use python 3.5.7 for builds
    * use osxfuse 3.8.3
- remove msgpack patch fix-msgpack-requirement.patch and borg_msgpack
  build conditional, since msgpack is bundled now (yeah!)

    + add prefer_system_lib* = True settings to setup.py - by default the
      build will prefer a shared library over the bundled code, if library
      and headers can be found and meet the minimum requirements.

- Update to borgbackup 1.1.3
- Fixes:
  * Security Fix for CVE-2017-15914: Incorrect implementation of access
    controls allows remote users to override repository restrictions in Borg
    servers. A user able to access a remote Borg SSH server is able to
    circumvent access controls post-authentication.
    Affected releases: 1.1.0, 1.1.1, 1.1.2. Releases 1.0.x are NOT affected.
  * crc32: deal with unaligned buffer, add tests - this broke borg on older ARM
    CPUs that can not deal with unaligned 32bit memory accesses and raise a bus
    error in such cases. the fix might also improve performance on some CPUs as
    all 32bit memory accesses by the crc32 code are properly aligned now.
  * mount: fixed support of --consider-part-files and do not show .borg_part_N
    files by default in the mounted FUSE filesystem.
  * fixed cache/repo timestamp inconsistency message, highlight that
    information is obtained from security dir (deleting the cache will not
    bypass this error in case the user knows this is a legitimate repo).
  * borgfs: don't show sub-command in borgfs help
  * create: show an error when --dry-run and --stats are used together
- New features:
  * mount: added exclusion group options and paths.
    Reused some code to support similar options/paths as borg extract offers -
    making good use of these to only mount a smaller subset of dirs/files can
    speed up mounting a lot and also will consume way less memory.
      borg mount [options] repo_or_archive mountpoint path [paths...]
    paths: you can just give some "root paths" (like for borg extract) to only
    partially populate the FUSE filesystem.
    new options: --exclude[-from], --pattern[s-from], --strip-components
 * create/extract: support st_birthtime on platforms supporting it
 * add "borg config" command for querying/setting/deleting config values
- Other changes:
 * clean up and simplify packaging (only package committed files,
   do not install .c/.h/.pyx files)
 * docs:
   * point out tuning options for borg create
   * add instructions for using ntfsclone, zerofree
   * move image backup-related FAQ entries to a new page
   * clarify key aliases for borg list --format
   * mention break-lock in checkpointing FAQ entry
   * document sshfs rename workaround
   * add FAQ about removing files from existing archives
   * add FAQ about different prune policies
   * usage and man page for borgfs
   * clarify create --stats duration vs. wall time
   * clarify encrypted key format for borg key export
   * update release checklist about security fixes
   * document good and problematic option placements, fix examples
   * add note on using --nobsdflags to avoid speed penalty related to bsdflags
   * move most of support section to www.borgbackup.org

  * create --stats: do not count data volume twice when checkpointing
  * recreate: move chunks_healthy when excluding hardlink master
  * recreate: get rid of chunks_healthy when rechunking (does not match)
  * check: get rid of already existing not matching chunks_healthy metadata
  * list: fix stdout broken pipe handling
  * list/diff: remove tag-file options (not used)
- New features:
  * bash, zsh and fish shell auto-completions, see scripts/shell_completions/
  * added BORG_CONFIG_DIR env var
- Other changes:
  * docs:
    * clarify using a blank passphrase in keyfile mode
    * mention "!" (exclude-norecurse) type in "patterns" help
    * document to first heal before running borg recreate to re-chunk stuff, because that will have to get rid of chunks_healthy metadata.
    * more than 23 is not supported for CHUNK_MAX_EXP
    * borg does not respect nodump flag by default any more
    * clarify same-filesystem requirement for borg upgrade

  autocompletion scripts for each shell.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 23 08:38:20 UTC 2017 - alarrosa@suse.com

- Update to borgbackup 1.1.1
- Compatibility notes:
  * When upgrading from borg 1.0.x to 1.1.x, please note:
    * read all the compatibility notes for 1.1.0*, starting from 1.1.0b1.
    * borg might ask some security-related questions once after upgrading.
      You can answer them either manually or via environment variable.
      One known case is if you use unencrypted repositories, then it will ask
      about a unknown unencrypted repository one time.
    * your first backup with 1.1.x might be significantly slower (it might
      completely read, chunk, hash a lot files) - this is due to the
      --files-cache mode change (and happens every time you change mode). You
      can avoid the one-time slowdown by using the pre-1.1.0rc4-compatible mode
      (but that is less safe for detecting changed files than the default).
      See the --files-cache docs for details.
  * The deprecated --no-files-cache is not a global/common option any more, but
    only available for borg create (it is not needed for anything else).
    Use --files-cache=disabled instead of --no-files-cache.
  * The nodump flag ("do not backup this file") is not honoured any more by
    default because this functionality (esp. if it happened by error or
    unexpected) was rather confusing and unexplainable at first to users.
    If you want that "do not backup NODUMP-flagged files" behaviour, use:
    borg create --exclude-nodump ...
- Fixes:
  * borg recreate: correctly compute part file sizes. fixes cosmetic, but
    annoying issue as borg check complains about size inconsistencies of part
    files in affected archives. you can solve that by running borg recreate
    on these archives.
  * bsdflags support: do not open BLK/CHR/LNK files, avoid crashes and slowness
  * recreate: don't crash on attic archives w/o time_end
  * don't crash on repository filesystems w/o hardlink support
  * don't crash in first part of truncate_and_unlink
  * fix server-side IndexError crash with clients < 1.0.7
  * don't show traceback if only a global option is given, show help
  * cache: use SaveFile for more safety
  * init: fix wrong encryption choices in command line parser, fix missing
    "authenticated-blake2"
  * move --no-files-cache from common to borg create options
  * fix detection of non-local path (failed on ..filename)
  * logging with fileConfig: set json attr on "borg" logger
  * fix crash with relative BORG_KEY_FILE
  * show excluded dir with "x" for tagged dirs / caches
- New features:
  * create: --nobsdflags and --exclude-nodump options
  * extract: --nobsdflags option
- Other changes:
  * remove annoying hardlinked symlinks warning
  * vagrant: use self-made FreeBSD 10.3 box
  * docs:
    * readme: -e option is required in borg 1.1
    * add example showing --show-version --show-rc
    * use --format rather than --list-format (deprecated) in example
    * update docs about hardlinked symlinks limitation

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Oct  8 12:02:03 UTC 2017 - alarrosa@suse.com

- Update to borgbackup 1.1.0
- Changelog:
  * Major new features in the 1.1 release series are:
    * borg recreate: remove files from existing archives and re-chunk or
      re-compress them. This finally allows deduplication between legacy
      Attic / Borg 0.xx archives and Borg 1.x archives. This is an
      experimental feature.
    * borg diff: show differences between two archives.
    * borg mount: show all recorded versions of files with the "versions view".
    * borg list: more formatting options, including generation of hashes and
      per-file chunk statistics.
    * borg create: automatic compression mode (-C auto,zlib/lz4/...), faster
      handling of many files, experimental support for inclusion patterns
      (--patterns, --patterns-from), files cache mode control (mtime/ctime)
    * borg export-tar: streaming export of GNU tar compatible archives.
    * Archive comments
    * BLAKE2b256-based encryption modes, and "authenticated" modes that provide
      data integrity without encryption. These provide better performance than
      the existing SHA-256-based modes on most hardware, except where the x86
      SHA extensions are available (e.g. AMD Ryzen).
    * Repository indices and the Borg cache now use checksums to detect bitrot
      and other corruption.
    * A documented JSON API has been added to the most vital commands
      (borg list, borg info and borg create).
    * Structured JSON logging is available for all commands.
    * --prefix has been supplemented with --glob-archives (-a), --sort-by,
      --last and --first options. These can be used for borg list, borg info,
      borg mount, borg check, borg delete and borg prune.
  * Quality of life improvements:
    * options that imply output (--show-rc, --show-version, --list, --stats,
      --progress) don't need -v/--info to have that output displayed any more.
    * borg check is silent by default (finally!).
    * borg can now checkpoint within (big) files, not only between files.
    * borg delete can delete multiple archives by giving their names.
    * Automatic removal of stale locks, which should make "borg break-lock"
      essentially superfluous. This is enabled by default, see
      BORG_HOSTNAME_IS_UNIQUE.
    * Answers to prompts like "Accessing previously unknown repository" are
      now saved immediately.
    * Cache synchronization and "borg info" are now faster.
    * Reduced space usage of chunks.archive.d in the cache by 30-40 %.
      Existing caches are migrated during a cache sync.
    * The cache used for remote cache syncs and mounting remote repositories
      does not grow indefinitely any more, but adapts to the available space.
      Good riddance, TMP=/var/tmp!
    * BORG_PASSCOMMAND makes using key rings and hardware keys much easier.
  * Documentation improvements
  * Compatibility notes for upgrading from Borg 1.0 to Borg 1.1:
    * No explicit "borg upgrade" is required.
    * Borg 1.1 uses some new data structures which are backwards-compatible
      with Borg 1.0.4 and newer.
    * Borg 1.0 can't make use of Borg 1.1's "compact cache" and will
      silently ignore it.
    * The default compression has been changed from "none" to "lz4".
    * Repositories in the "repokey" and "repokey-blake2" modes with an empty
      passphrase are now treated as unencrypted repositories for security
      checks (e.g. BORG_UNKNOWN_UNENCRYPTED_REPO_ACCESS_IS_OK).
    * borg init:
      + -e/--encryption is now a mandatory option with no default value.
        Previously the default value was "repokey".
      + the short form of --append-only (-a) has been removed.
      + running "borg init" via a "borg serve --append-only" server will not
        create an append-only repository any more.
        Use "borg init --append-only" to initialize an append-only repository.
    * borg create: the --exclude-if-present option now supports tagging a
      folder with any file system object type (file, folder, etc.), instead of
      accepting only files as tags.
    * borg upgrade: the short form of --inplace (-i) has been removed.
    * borg delete: the short form of --cache-only (-c) has been removed.
    * "borg migrate-to-repokey" has been renamed to
      "borg key migrate-to-repokey" with no deprecation notice, since it is
      rarely and only manually used.

- update to version 1.0.9 (2016-12-20)
  - Security fixes:
    - A flaw in the cryptographic authentication scheme in Borg allowed
      an attacker to spoof the manifest. See :ref:`tam_vuln` above for
      the steps you should take.
      Fixes CVE-2016-10099
    - borg check: When rebuilding the manifest (which should only be
      needed very rarely) duplicate archive names would be handled on a
      "first come first serve" basis, allowing an attacker to apparently
      replace archives.
      Fixes CVE-2016-10100

      unchanged files in next backup), #1860.
    - borg check:
      - fix incorrectly reporting attic 0.13 and earlier archives as corrupt
      - handle repo w/o objects gracefully and also bail out early if repo

      or lost connections or systemd sending SIGHUP.
    - progress display: adapt formatting to narrow screens, do not crash,
      #1628
    - borg create --read-special - fix crash on broken symlink, #1584. also

- update to version 1.0.6 (2016-07-12)
  Bug fixes:
  * Linux: handle multiple LD_PRELOAD entries correctly, #1314, #1111
  * Fix crash with unclear message if the libc is not found, #1314, #1111
  Other changes:
  * tests:
    * Fixed O_NOATIME tests for Solaris and GNU Hurd, #1315
    * Fixed sparse file tests for (file) systems not supporting it, #1310
  * docs:
    * Fixed syntax highlighting, #1313
    * misc docs: added data processing overview picture

- update to version 1.0.6rc1 (2016-07-10)
  New features:
  * borg check –repair: heal damaged files if missing chunks re-appear (e.g. if the
    previously missing chunk was added again in a later backup archive), #148. (*)
    Also improved logging.
  Bug fixes:
  * sync_dir: silence fsync() failing with EINVAL, #1287 Some network filesystems
    (like smbfs) don’t support this and we use this in repository code.
  * borg mount (FUSE):
    fix directories being shadowed when contained paths were also specified, #1295
    raise I/O Error (EIO) on damaged files (unless -o allow_damaged_files is used),
    #1302. (*)
  * borg extract: warn if a damaged file is extracted, #1299. (*)
    Added some missing return code checks (ChunkIndex._add, hashindex_resize).
  * borg check: fix/optimize initial hash table size, avoids resize of the table.
  Other changes:
  * tests:
    add more FUSE tests, #1284
    deduplicate fuse (u)mount code
    fix borg binary test issues, #862
  * docs:
    changelog: added release dates to older borg releases
    fix some sphinx (docs generator) warnings, #881

  Notes:
  (*) Some features depend on information (chunks_healthy list) added to item metadata
      when a file with missing chunks was “repaired” using all-zero replacement chunks.
      The chunks_healthy list is generated since borg 1.0.4, thus borg can’t recognize
      such “repaired” (but content-damaged) files if the repair was done with an older
      borg version.

- update to version 1.0.5 (2016-07-07)
  Bug fixes:
  * borg mount: fix FUSE crash in xattr code on Linux introduced in 1.0.4, #1282
  Other changes:
  * backport some FAQ entries from master branch
  * add release helper scripts
  * Vagrantfile:
    centos6: no FUSE, don’t build binary
    add xz for redhat-like dists

- update to version 1.0.4 (2016-07-07)
  New features:
  * borg serve –append-only, #1168 This was included because it was a simple change
    (append-only functionality was already present via repository config file) and makes
    better security now practically usable.
  * BORG_REMOTE_PATH environment variable, #1258 This was included because it was a simple
    change (–remote-path cli option was already present) and makes borg much easier to use
    if you need it.
  * Repository: cleanup incomplete transaction on “no space left” condition. In many cases,
    this can avoid a 100% full repo filesystem (which is very problematic as borg always
    needs free space - even to delete archives).
  Bug fixes:
  * Fix wrong handling and reporting of OSErrors in borg create, #1138. This was a serious
    issue: in the context of “borg create”, errors like repository I/O errors (e.g. disk
    I/O errors, ssh repo connection errors) were handled badly and did not lead to a crash
    (which would be good for this case, because the repo transaction would be incomplete and
    trigger a transaction rollback to clean up). Now, error handling for source files is
    cleanly separated from every other error handling, so only problematic input files are
    logged and skipped.
  * Implement fail-safe error handling for borg extract. Note that this isn’t nearly as
    critical as the borg create error handling bug, since nothing is written to the repo.
    So this was “merely” misleading error reporting.
  * Add missing error handler in directory attr restore loop.
  * repo: make sure write data hits disk before the commit tag (#1236) and also sync the
    containing directory.
  * FUSE: getxattr fail must use errno.ENOATTR, #1126 (fixes Mac OS X Finder malfunction:
    “zero bytes” file length, access denied)
  * borg check –repair: do not lose information about the good/original chunks. If we do not
    lose the original chunk IDs list when “repairing” a file (replacing missing chunks with
    all-zero chunks), we have a chance to “heal” the file back into its original state later,
    in case the chunks re-appear (e.g. in a fresh backup). Healing is not implemented yet,
    see #148.
  * fixes for –read-special mode:
    ignore known files cache, #1241
    fake regular file mode, #1214
    improve symlinks handling, #1215
  * remove passphrase from subprocess environment, #1105
  * Ignore empty index file (will trigger index rebuild), #1195
  * add missing placeholder support for –prefix, #1027
  * improve exception handling for placeholder replacement
  * catch and format exceptions in arg parsing
  * helpers: fix “undefined name ‘e’” in exception handler
  * better error handling for missing repo manifest, #1043
  * borg delete:
    make it possible to delete a repo without manifest
    borg delete –forced allows to delete corrupted archives, #1139
  * borg check:
    make borg check work for empty repo
    fix resync and msgpacked item qualifier, #1135
    rebuild_manifest: fix crash if ‘name’ or ‘time’ key were missing.
    better validation of item metadata dicts, #1130
    better validation of archive metadata dicts
  * close the repo on exit - even if rollback did not work, #1197. This is rather cosmetic,
    it avoids repo closing in the destructor.
  * tests:
    fix sparse file test, #1170
    flake8: ignore new F405, #1185
    catch “invalid argument” on cygwin, #257
    fix sparseness assertion in test prep, #1264
  Other changes:
  * make borg build/work on OpenSSL 1.0 and 1.1, #1187
  * docs / help:
    fix / clarify prune help, #1143
    fix “patterns” help formatting
    add missing docs / help about placeholders
    resources: rename atticmatic to borgmatic
    document sshd settings, #545
    more details about checkpoints, add split trick, #1171
    support docs: add freenode web chat link, #1175
    add prune visualization / example, #723
    add note that Fnmatch is default, #1247
    make clear that lzma levels > 6 are a waste of cpu cycles
    add a “do not edit” note to auto-generated files, #1250
    update cygwin installation docs
  * repository interoperability with borg master (1.1dev) branch:
    borg check: read item metadata keys from manifest, #1147
    read v2 hints files, #1235
    fix hints file “unknown version” error handling bug
  * tests: add tests for format_line
  * llfuse: update version requirement for freebsd
  * Vagrantfile:
    use openbsd 5.9, #716
    do not install llfuse on netbsd (broken)
    update OSXfuse to version 3.3.3
    use Python 3.5.2 to build the binaries
  * glibc compatibility checker: scripts/glibc_check.py
  * add .eggs to .gitignore

Tue Jun 14 07:51:21 UTC 2016 - hpj@urpla.net

- Update to version 1.0.3:

  Bug fixes:

  - prune: avoid that checkpoints are kept and completed archives are deleted
    in a prune run), #997
  - prune: fix commandline argument validation - some valid command lines were
    considered invalid (annoying, but harmless), #942
  - fix capabilities extraction on Linux (set xattrs last, after chown()), #1069
  - repository: fix commit tags being seen in data
  - when probing key files, do binary reads. avoids crash when non-borg binary
    files are located in borg's key files directory.
  - handle SIGTERM and make a clean exit - avoids orphan lock files.
  - repository cache: don't cache large objects (avoid using lots of temp. disk
    space), #1063

  Other changes:

  - Vagrantfile: OS X: update osxfuse / install lzma package, #933
  - setup.py: add check for platform_darwin.c
  - setup.py: on freebsd, use a llfuse release that builds ok
  - docs / help:
    - update readthedocs URLs, #991
    - add missing docs for "borg break-lock", #992
    - borg create help: add some words to about the archive name
    - borg create help: document format tags, #894

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 11 21:02:30 UTC 2016 - hpj@urpla.net

- Update to version 1.0.2:

  Bug fixes:

  - fix malfunction and potential corruption on (nowadays rather rare)
    big-endian architectures or bi-endian archs in (rare) BE mode. #886, #889
    cache resync / index merge was malfunctioning due to this, potentially
    leading to data loss. borg info had cosmetic issues (displayed wrong values).
    note: all (widespread) little-endian archs (like x86/x64) or bi-endian
    archs in (widespread) LE mode (like ARMEL, MIPSEL, ...) were NOT affected.
  - add overflow and range checks for 1st (special) uint32 of the hashindex
    values, switch from int32 to uint32.
  - fix so that refcount will never overflow, but just stick to max. value after
    a overflow would have occured.
  - borg delete: fix --cache-only for broken caches, #874
    Makes --cache-only idempotent: it won't fail if the cache is already deleted.
  - fixed borg create --one-file-system erroneously traversing into other
    filesystems (if starting fs device number was 0), #873
  - workround a bug in Linux fadvise FADV_DONTNEED, #907

  Other changes:

  - better test coverage for hashindex, incl. overflow testing, checking correct
    computations so endianness issues would be discovered.
  - reproducible doc for ProgressIndicator*, make the build reproducible.
  - use latest llfuse for vagrant machines
  - docs:
    - use /path/to/repo in examples, fixes #901
    - fix confusing usage of "repo" as archive name (use "arch")

Sun Apr 10 20:02:04 UTC 2016 - hpj@urpla.net

- Update to version 1.0.1:
  New features:

  Usually there are no new features in a bugfix release, but these were added
  due to their high impact on security/safety/speed or because they are fixes
  also:

  - append-only mode for repositories, #809, #36 (see docs)
  - borg create: add --ignore-inode option to make borg detect unmodified files
    even if your filesystem does not have stable inode numbers (like sshfs and
    possibly CIFS).
  - add options --warning, --error, --critical for missing log levels, #826.
    it's not recommended to suppress warnings or errors, but the user may decide
    this on his own.
    note: --warning is not given to borg serve so a <= 1.0.0 borg will still
    work as server (it is not needed as it is the default).
    do not use --error or --critical when using a <= 1.0.0 borg server.

  Bug fixes:

  - fix silently skipping EIO, #748
  - add context manager for Repository (avoid orphan repository locks), #285
  - do not sleep for >60s while waiting for lock, #773
  - unpack file stats before passing to FUSE
  - fix build on illumos
  - don't try to backup doors or event ports (Solaris and derivates)
  - remove useless/misleading libc version display, #738
  - test suite: reset exit code of persistent archiver, #844
  - RemoteRepository: clean up pipe if remote open() fails
  - Remote: don't print tracebacks for Error exceptions handled downstream, #792
  - if BORG_PASSPHRASE is present but wrong, don't prompt for password, but fail
    instead, #791
  - ArchiveChecker: move "orphaned objects check skipped" to INFO log level, #826
  - fix capitalization, add ellipses, change log level to debug for 2 messages,
    #798

  Other changes:

  - update llfuse requirement, llfuse 1.0 works
  - update OS / dist packages on build machines, #717
  - prefer showing --info over -v in usage help, #859
  - docs:

    - fix cygwin requirements (gcc-g++)
    - document how to debug / file filesystem issues, #664
    - fix reproducible build of api docs
    - RTD theme: CSS !important overwrite, #727
    - Document logo font. Recreate logo png. Remove GIMP logo file.

- rename package to borgbackup
- create/install html docs/man page
- remove dependency on python3-pytest-benchmark
