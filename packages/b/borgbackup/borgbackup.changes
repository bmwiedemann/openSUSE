- Update to 1.1.11
  Fixes:
    * fixed potential index corruption / data loss issue due to bug in
      hashindex_set, #4829 Please read and follow the more detailled notes
      close to the top of this document.
    * upgrade bundled xxhash to 0.7.3, #4891 0.7.2 is the minimum requirement
      for correct operations on ARMv6 in non-fixup mode, where unaligned memory
      accesses cause bus errors. 0.7.3 adds some speedups and libxxhash 0.7.3
      even has a pkg-config file now.
    * upgrade bundled lz4 to 1.9.2
    * upgrade bundled zstd to 1.4.4
    * fix crash when upgrading erroneous hints file, #4922

      hardlink.
    * support linux platforms without sync_file_range (e.g. Android 7 with
      Termux), #4905
  Other:

Wed Mar 11 17:52:25 UTC 2020 - Paolo Stivanin <info@paolostivanin.com>

- fix building with python3 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct 31 11:20:34 UTC 2019 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Require python3-setuptools since it's needed when running borg
  to find the entry point (boo#1134650)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 23 09:40:02 UTC 2019 - Hans-Peter Jansen <hpj@urpla.net>

- Update to version 1.1.10 (2019-05-16)
  + Compatibility notes:
    * When upgrading from borg 1.0.x to 1.1.x, please note:
    * read all the compatibility notes for 1.1.0*, starting from
      1.1.0b1.
    * borg upgrade: you do not need to and you also should not run
      it.
    * borg might ask some security-related questions once after
      upgrading. You can answer them either manually or via
      environment variable. One known case is if you use
      unencrypted repositories, then it will ask about a unknown
      unencrypted repository one time.
    * your first backup with 1.1.x might be significantly slower
      (it might completely read, chunk, hash a lot files) - this is
      due to the --files-cache mode change (and happens every time
      you change mode). You can avoid the one-time slowdown by
      using the pre-1.1.0rc4-compatible mode (but that is less safe
      for detecting changed files than the default). See the
      --files-cache docs for details.
  + Fixes:
    * extract: hang on partial extraction with ssh: repo, when
      hardlink master is not matched/extracted and borg hangs on
      related slave hardlink, #4350
    * lrucache: regularly remove old FDs, #4427
    * avoid stale filehandle issues, #3265
    * freebsd: make xattr platform code api compatible with linux,
      #3952
    * use whitelist approach for borg serve, #4097
    * borg command shall terminate with rc 2 for ImportErrors,
      #4424
    * create: only run stat_simple_attrs() once, this increases
      backup with lots of unchanged files performance by ~ 5%.
    * prune: fix incorrect borg prune --stats output with --dry-
      run, #4373
    * key export: emit user-friendly error if repo key is exported
      to a directory, #4348
  + New features:
    * bundle latest supported msgpack-python release (0.5.6),
      remove msgpack-python from setup.py install_requires - by
      default we use the bundled code now. optionally, we still
      support using an external msgpack (see hints in setup.py),
      but this requires solid requirements management within
      distributions and is not recommended. borgbackup will break
      if you upgrade msgpack to an unsupported version.
    * display msgpack version as part of sysinfo (e.g. in
      tracebacks)
    * timestamp for borg delete --info added, #4359
    * enable placeholder usage in --comment and --glob-archives,
      #4559, #4495
  + Other:
    * serve: do not check python/libc for borg serve, #4483
    * shell completions: borg diff second archive
    * release scripts: signing binaries with Qubes OS support
    * testing:
    * vagrant: upgrade openbsd box to 6.4
    * travis-ci: lock test env to py 3.4 compatible versions, #4343
    * get rid of confusing coverage warning, #2069
    * rename test_mount_hardlinks to test_fuse_mount_hardlinks, so
      both can be excluded by "not test_fuse".
    * pure-py msgpack warning shall not make a lot of tests fail,
      #4558
    * docs:
    * add "SSH Configuration" section to "borg serve", #3988, #636,
      #4485
    * README: new URL for funding options
    * add a sample logging.conf in docs/misc, #4380
    * elaborate on append-only mode docs, #3504
    * installation: added Alpine Linux to distribution list, #4415
    * usage.html: only modify window.location when redirecting,
      #4133
    * add msgpack license to docs/3rd_party/msgpack
    * vagrant / binary builds:
    * use python 3.5.7 for builds
    * use osxfuse 3.8.3
- remove msgpack patch fix-msgpack-requirement.patch and borg_msgpack
  build conditional, since msgpack is bundled now (yeah!)

  * Fix a potential data corruption issue with 'borg check --repair'
    happening in borg >= 1.1 and < 1.1.4
  * zstd compression is new in borg 1.1.4, older borg can't handle it.
  * new minimum requirements for the compression libraries:
    + added requirement: libzstd >= 1.3.0
    + updated requirement: liblz4 >= 1.7.0 / r129
- Fixes:
  * check: data corruption fix: fix for borg check --repair malfunction. See
   the more detailed notes at
   https://github.com/borgbackup/borg/blob/1.1.4/docs/changes.rst
  * delete: also delete security dir when deleting a repo
  * prune: fix building the "borg prune" man page
  * init: use given --storage-quota for local repo
  * init: properly quote repo path in output
  * fix startup delay with dns-only own fqdn resolving
- New features:
  * added zstd compression.
  * added placeholder {reverse-fqdn} for fqdn in reverse notation
  * added BORG_BASE_DIR environment variable
- Other changes:
  * list help topics when invalid topic is requested
  * fix lz4 deprecation warning, requires lz4 >= 1.7.0 (r129)
  * add parens for C preprocessor macro argument usages (did not cause
    malfunction)

      consistency: we also have BORG_LIBB2_PREFIX and BORG_LIBZSTD_PREFIX now.
    + add prefer_system_lib* = True settings to setup.py - by default the
      build will prefer a shared library over the bundled code, if library
      and headers can be found and meet the minimum requirements.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec 11 09:11:21 UTC 2017 - alarrosa@suse.com

- Update to borgbackup 1.1.3
- Fixes:
  * Security Fix for CVE-2017-15914: Incorrect implementation of access
    controls allows remote users to override repository restrictions in Borg
    servers. A user able to access a remote Borg SSH server is able to
    circumvent access controls post-authentication.
    Affected releases: 1.1.0, 1.1.1, 1.1.2. Releases 1.0.x are NOT affected.
  * crc32: deal with unaligned buffer, add tests - this broke borg on older ARM
    CPUs that can not deal with unaligned 32bit memory accesses and raise a bus
    error in such cases. the fix might also improve performance on some CPUs as
    all 32bit memory accesses by the crc32 code are properly aligned now.
  * mount: fixed support of --consider-part-files and do not show .borg_part_N
    files by default in the mounted FUSE filesystem.
  * fixed cache/repo timestamp inconsistency message, highlight that
    information is obtained from security dir (deleting the cache will not
    bypass this error in case the user knows this is a legitimate repo).
  * borgfs: don't show sub-command in borgfs help
  * create: show an error when --dry-run and --stats are used together
- New features:
  * mount: added exclusion group options and paths.
    Reused some code to support similar options/paths as borg extract offers -
    making good use of these to only mount a smaller subset of dirs/files can
    speed up mounting a lot and also will consume way less memory.
      borg mount [options] repo_or_archive mountpoint path [paths...]
    paths: you can just give some "root paths" (like for borg extract) to only
    partially populate the FUSE filesystem.
    new options: --exclude[-from], --pattern[s-from], --strip-components
 * create/extract: support st_birthtime on platforms supporting it
 * add "borg config" command for querying/setting/deleting config values
- Other changes:
 * clean up and simplify packaging (only package committed files,
   do not install .c/.h/.pyx files)
 * docs:
   * point out tuning options for borg create
   * add instructions for using ntfsclone, zerofree
   * move image backup-related FAQ entries to a new page
   * clarify key aliases for borg list --format
   * mention break-lock in checkpointing FAQ entry
   * document sshfs rename workaround
   * add FAQ about removing files from existing archives
   * add FAQ about different prune policies
   * usage and man page for borgfs
   * clarify create --stats duration vs. wall time
   * clarify encrypted key format for borg key export
   * update release checklist about security fixes
   * document good and problematic option placements, fix examples
   * add note on using --nobsdflags to avoid speed penalty related to bsdflags
   * move most of support section to www.borgbackup.org

Wed Nov  8 18:44:37 UTC 2017 - alarrosa@suse.com

- Update to borgbackup 1.1.2
- Fixes:
  * fix KeyError crash when talking to borg server < 1.0.7
  * extract: set bsdflags last (include immutable flag)
  * create: don't do stat() call on excluded-norecurse directory, fix exception handling for stat() call
  * create --stats: do not count data volume twice when checkpointing
  * recreate: move chunks_healthy when excluding hardlink master
  * recreate: get rid of chunks_healthy when rechunking (does not match)
  * check: get rid of already existing not matching chunks_healthy metadata
  * list: fix stdout broken pipe handling
  * list/diff: remove tag-file options (not used)
- New features:
  * bash, zsh and fish shell auto-completions, see scripts/shell_completions/
  * added BORG_CONFIG_DIR env var
- Other changes:
  * docs:
    * clarify using a blank passphrase in keyfile mode

- Update to borgbackup 1.1.1
- Compatibility notes:
  * When upgrading from borg 1.0.x to 1.1.x, please note:
    * read all the compatibility notes for 1.1.0*, starting from 1.1.0b1.
    * borg might ask some security-related questions once after upgrading.
      You can answer them either manually or via environment variable.
      One known case is if you use unencrypted repositories, then it will ask
      about a unknown unencrypted repository one time.
    * your first backup with 1.1.x might be significantly slower (it might
      completely read, chunk, hash a lot files) - this is due to the
      --files-cache mode change (and happens every time you change mode). You
      can avoid the one-time slowdown by using the pre-1.1.0rc4-compatible mode
      (but that is less safe for detecting changed files than the default).
      See the --files-cache docs for details.
  * The deprecated --no-files-cache is not a global/common option any more, but
    only available for borg create (it is not needed for anything else).
    Use --files-cache=disabled instead of --no-files-cache.
  * The nodump flag ("do not backup this file") is not honoured any more by
    default because this functionality (esp. if it happened by error or
    unexpected) was rather confusing and unexplainable at first to users.
    If you want that "do not backup NODUMP-flagged files" behaviour, use:
    borg create --exclude-nodump ...
- Fixes:
  * borg recreate: correctly compute part file sizes. fixes cosmetic, but
    annoying issue as borg check complains about size inconsistencies of part
    files in affected archives. you can solve that by running borg recreate
    on these archives.
  * bsdflags support: do not open BLK/CHR/LNK files, avoid crashes and slowness
  * recreate: don't crash on attic archives w/o time_end
  * don't crash on repository filesystems w/o hardlink support
  * don't crash in first part of truncate_and_unlink
  * fix server-side IndexError crash with clients < 1.0.7
  * don't show traceback if only a global option is given, show help
  * cache: use SaveFile for more safety
  * init: fix wrong encryption choices in command line parser, fix missing
    "authenticated-blake2"
  * move --no-files-cache from common to borg create options
  * fix detection of non-local path (failed on ..filename)
  * logging with fileConfig: set json attr on "borg" logger
  * fix crash with relative BORG_KEY_FILE
  * show excluded dir with "x" for tagged dirs / caches
- New features:
  * create: --nobsdflags and --exclude-nodump options
  * extract: --nobsdflags option
- Other changes:
  * remove annoying hardlinked symlinks warning
  * vagrant: use self-made FreeBSD 10.3 box
  * docs:
    * readme: -e option is required in borg 1.1
    * add example showing --show-version --show-rc
    * use --format rather than --list-format (deprecated) in example
    * update docs about hardlinked symlinks limitation

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Oct  8 12:02:03 UTC 2017 - alarrosa@suse.com

- Update to borgbackup 1.1.0
- Changelog:
  * Major new features in the 1.1 release series are:
    * borg recreate: remove files from existing archives and re-chunk or
      re-compress them. This finally allows deduplication between legacy
      Attic / Borg 0.xx archives and Borg 1.x archives. This is an
      experimental feature.
    * borg diff: show differences between two archives.
    * borg mount: show all recorded versions of files with the "versions view".
    * borg list: more formatting options, including generation of hashes and
      per-file chunk statistics.
    * borg create: automatic compression mode (-C auto,zlib/lz4/...), faster
      handling of many files, experimental support for inclusion patterns
      (--patterns, --patterns-from), files cache mode control (mtime/ctime)
    * borg export-tar: streaming export of GNU tar compatible archives.
    * Archive comments
    * BLAKE2b256-based encryption modes, and "authenticated" modes that provide
      data integrity without encryption. These provide better performance than
      the existing SHA-256-based modes on most hardware, except where the x86
      SHA extensions are available (e.g. AMD Ryzen).
    * Repository indices and the Borg cache now use checksums to detect bitrot
      and other corruption.
    * A documented JSON API has been added to the most vital commands
      (borg list, borg info and borg create).
    * Structured JSON logging is available for all commands.
    * --prefix has been supplemented with --glob-archives (-a), --sort-by,
      --last and --first options. These can be used for borg list, borg info,
      borg mount, borg check, borg delete and borg prune.
  * Quality of life improvements:
    * options that imply output (--show-rc, --show-version, --list, --stats,
      --progress) don't need -v/--info to have that output displayed any more.
    * borg check is silent by default (finally!).
    * borg can now checkpoint within (big) files, not only between files.
    * borg delete can delete multiple archives by giving their names.
    * Automatic removal of stale locks, which should make "borg break-lock"
      essentially superfluous. This is enabled by default, see
      BORG_HOSTNAME_IS_UNIQUE.
    * Answers to prompts like "Accessing previously unknown repository" are
      now saved immediately.
    * Cache synchronization and "borg info" are now faster.
    * Reduced space usage of chunks.archive.d in the cache by 30-40 %.
      Existing caches are migrated during a cache sync.
    * The cache used for remote cache syncs and mounting remote repositories
      does not grow indefinitely any more, but adapts to the available space.
      Good riddance, TMP=/var/tmp!
    * BORG_PASSCOMMAND makes using key rings and hardware keys much easier.
  * Documentation improvements
  * Compatibility notes for upgrading from Borg 1.0 to Borg 1.1:
    * No explicit "borg upgrade" is required.
    * Borg 1.1 uses some new data structures which are backwards-compatible
      with Borg 1.0.4 and newer.
    * Borg 1.0 can't make use of Borg 1.1's "compact cache" and will
      silently ignore it.
    * The default compression has been changed from "none" to "lz4".
    * Repositories in the "repokey" and "repokey-blake2" modes with an empty
      passphrase are now treated as unencrypted repositories for security
      checks (e.g. BORG_UNKNOWN_UNENCRYPTED_REPO_ACCESS_IS_OK).
    * borg init:
      + -e/--encryption is now a mandatory option with no default value.
        Previously the default value was "repokey".
      + the short form of --append-only (-a) has been removed.
      + running "borg init" via a "borg serve --append-only" server will not
        create an append-only repository any more.
        Use "borg init --append-only" to initialize an append-only repository.
    * borg create: the --exclude-if-present option now supports tagging a
      folder with any file system object type (file, folder, etc.), instead of
      accepting only files as tags.
    * borg upgrade: the short form of --inplace (-i) has been removed.
    * borg delete: the short form of --cache-only (-c) has been removed.
    * "borg migrate-to-repokey" has been renamed to
      "borg key migrate-to-repokey" with no deprecation notice, since it is
      rarely and only manually used.

      the steps you should take.
      Fixes CVE-2016-10099
    - borg check: When rebuilding the manifest (which should only be

    - borg check:
      - fix incorrectly reporting attic 0.13 and earlier archives as corrupt
      - handle repo w/o objects gracefully and also bail out early if repo

      leftover lock files for quickly repeated signals (e.g. Ctrl-C Ctrl-C)
      or lost connections or systemd sending SIGHUP.
    - progress display: adapt formatting to narrow screens, do not crash,
      #1628
    - borg create --read-special - fix crash on broken symlink, #1584. also

Sat Jul 16 09:33:09 UTC 2016 - hpj@urpla.net

- update to version 1.0.6 (2016-07-12)
  Bug fixes:
  * Linux: handle multiple LD_PRELOAD entries correctly, #1314, #1111
  * Fix crash with unclear message if the libc is not found, #1314, #1111
  Other changes:
  * tests:
    * Fixed O_NOATIME tests for Solaris and GNU Hurd, #1315
    * Fixed sparse file tests for (file) systems not supporting it, #1310
  * docs:
    * Fixed syntax highlighting, #1313
    * misc docs: added data processing overview picture

- update to version 1.0.6rc1 (2016-07-10)
  New features:
  * borg check –repair: heal damaged files if missing chunks re-appear (e.g. if the
    previously missing chunk was added again in a later backup archive), #148. (*)
    Also improved logging.
  Bug fixes:
  * sync_dir: silence fsync() failing with EINVAL, #1287 Some network filesystems
    (like smbfs) don’t support this and we use this in repository code.
  * borg mount (FUSE):
    fix directories being shadowed when contained paths were also specified, #1295
    raise I/O Error (EIO) on damaged files (unless -o allow_damaged_files is used),
    #1302. (*)
  * borg extract: warn if a damaged file is extracted, #1299. (*)
    Added some missing return code checks (ChunkIndex._add, hashindex_resize).
  * borg check: fix/optimize initial hash table size, avoids resize of the table.
  Other changes:
  * tests:
    add more FUSE tests, #1284
    deduplicate fuse (u)mount code
    fix borg binary test issues, #862
  * docs:
    changelog: added release dates to older borg releases
    fix some sphinx (docs generator) warnings, #881

  Notes:
  (*) Some features depend on information (chunks_healthy list) added to item metadata
      when a file with missing chunks was “repaired” using all-zero replacement chunks.
      The chunks_healthy list is generated since borg 1.0.4, thus borg can’t recognize
      such “repaired” (but content-damaged) files if the repair was done with an older
      borg version.

- update to version 1.0.5 (2016-07-07)
  Bug fixes:
  * borg mount: fix FUSE crash in xattr code on Linux introduced in 1.0.4, #1282
  Other changes:
  * backport some FAQ entries from master branch
  * add release helper scripts
  * Vagrantfile:
    centos6: no FUSE, don’t build binary
    add xz for redhat-like dists

- update to version 1.0.4 (2016-07-07)
  New features:
  * borg serve –append-only, #1168 This was included because it was a simple change
    (append-only functionality was already present via repository config file) and makes
    better security now practically usable.
  * BORG_REMOTE_PATH environment variable, #1258 This was included because it was a simple
    change (–remote-path cli option was already present) and makes borg much easier to use
    if you need it.
  * Repository: cleanup incomplete transaction on “no space left” condition. In many cases,
    this can avoid a 100% full repo filesystem (which is very problematic as borg always
    needs free space - even to delete archives).
  Bug fixes:
  * Fix wrong handling and reporting of OSErrors in borg create, #1138. This was a serious
    issue: in the context of “borg create”, errors like repository I/O errors (e.g. disk
    I/O errors, ssh repo connection errors) were handled badly and did not lead to a crash
    (which would be good for this case, because the repo transaction would be incomplete and
    trigger a transaction rollback to clean up). Now, error handling for source files is
    cleanly separated from every other error handling, so only problematic input files are
    logged and skipped.
  * Implement fail-safe error handling for borg extract. Note that this isn’t nearly as
    critical as the borg create error handling bug, since nothing is written to the repo.
    So this was “merely” misleading error reporting.
  * Add missing error handler in directory attr restore loop.
  * repo: make sure write data hits disk before the commit tag (#1236) and also sync the
    containing directory.
  * FUSE: getxattr fail must use errno.ENOATTR, #1126 (fixes Mac OS X Finder malfunction:
    “zero bytes” file length, access denied)
  * borg check –repair: do not lose information about the good/original chunks. If we do not
    lose the original chunk IDs list when “repairing” a file (replacing missing chunks with
    all-zero chunks), we have a chance to “heal” the file back into its original state later,
    in case the chunks re-appear (e.g. in a fresh backup). Healing is not implemented yet,
    see #148.
  * fixes for –read-special mode:
    ignore known files cache, #1241
    fake regular file mode, #1214
    improve symlinks handling, #1215
  * remove passphrase from subprocess environment, #1105
  * Ignore empty index file (will trigger index rebuild), #1195
  * add missing placeholder support for –prefix, #1027
  * improve exception handling for placeholder replacement
  * catch and format exceptions in arg parsing
  * helpers: fix “undefined name ‘e’” in exception handler
  * better error handling for missing repo manifest, #1043
  * borg delete:
    make it possible to delete a repo without manifest
    borg delete –forced allows to delete corrupted archives, #1139
  * borg check:
    make borg check work for empty repo
    fix resync and msgpacked item qualifier, #1135
    rebuild_manifest: fix crash if ‘name’ or ‘time’ key were missing.
    better validation of item metadata dicts, #1130
    better validation of archive metadata dicts
  * close the repo on exit - even if rollback did not work, #1197. This is rather cosmetic,
    it avoids repo closing in the destructor.
  * tests:
    fix sparse file test, #1170
    flake8: ignore new F405, #1185
    catch “invalid argument” on cygwin, #257
    fix sparseness assertion in test prep, #1264
  Other changes:
  * make borg build/work on OpenSSL 1.0 and 1.1, #1187
  * docs / help:
    fix / clarify prune help, #1143
    fix “patterns” help formatting
    add missing docs / help about placeholders
    resources: rename atticmatic to borgmatic
    document sshd settings, #545
    more details about checkpoints, add split trick, #1171
    support docs: add freenode web chat link, #1175
    add prune visualization / example, #723
    add note that Fnmatch is default, #1247
    make clear that lzma levels > 6 are a waste of cpu cycles
    add a “do not edit” note to auto-generated files, #1250
    update cygwin installation docs
  * repository interoperability with borg master (1.1dev) branch:
    borg check: read item metadata keys from manifest, #1147
    read v2 hints files, #1235
    fix hints file “unknown version” error handling bug
  * tests: add tests for format_line
  * llfuse: update version requirement for freebsd
  * Vagrantfile:
    use openbsd 5.9, #716
    do not install llfuse on netbsd (broken)
    update OSXfuse to version 3.3.3
    use Python 3.5.2 to build the binaries
  * glibc compatibility checker: scripts/glibc_check.py
  * add .eggs to .gitignore

    considered invalid (annoying, but harmless), #942
  - fix capabilities extraction on Linux (set xattrs last, after chown()), #1069
  - repository: fix commit tags being seen in data
  - when probing key files, do binary reads. avoids crash when non-borg binary
    files are located in borg's key files directory.
  - handle SIGTERM and make a clean exit - avoids orphan lock files.
  - repository cache: don't cache large objects (avoid using lots of temp. disk
    space), #1063

  Other changes:

  - Vagrantfile: OS X: update osxfuse / install lzma package, #933
  - setup.py: add check for platform_darwin.c
  - setup.py: on freebsd, use a llfuse release that builds ok
  - docs / help:
    - update readthedocs URLs, #991
    - add missing docs for "borg break-lock", #992
    - borg create help: add some words to about the archive name
    - borg create help: document format tags, #894

- Update to version 1.0.2:

  Bug fixes:

  - fix malfunction and potential corruption on (nowadays rather rare)
    big-endian architectures or bi-endian archs in (rare) BE mode. #886, #889
    cache resync / index merge was malfunctioning due to this, potentially
    leading to data loss. borg info had cosmetic issues (displayed wrong values).
    note: all (widespread) little-endian archs (like x86/x64) or bi-endian
    archs in (widespread) LE mode (like ARMEL, MIPSEL, ...) were NOT affected.
  - add overflow and range checks for 1st (special) uint32 of the hashindex
    values, switch from int32 to uint32.
  - fix so that refcount will never overflow, but just stick to max. value after
    a overflow would have occured.
  - borg delete: fix --cache-only for broken caches, #874
    Makes --cache-only idempotent: it won't fail if the cache is already deleted.
  - fixed borg create --one-file-system erroneously traversing into other
    filesystems (if starting fs device number was 0), #873
  - workround a bug in Linux fadvise FADV_DONTNEED, #907

  Other changes:

  - better test coverage for hashindex, incl. overflow testing, checking correct
    computations so endianness issues would be discovered.
  - reproducible doc for ProgressIndicator*, make the build reproducible.
  - use latest llfuse for vagrant machines
  - docs:
    - use /path/to/repo in examples, fixes #901
    - fix confusing usage of "repo" as archive name (use "arch")

- Update to version 1.0.1:
  New features:

  Usually there are no new features in a bugfix release, but these were added
  due to their high impact on security/safety/speed or because they are fixes
  also:

  - append-only mode for repositories, #809, #36 (see docs)
  - borg create: add --ignore-inode option to make borg detect unmodified files
    even if your filesystem does not have stable inode numbers (like sshfs and
    possibly CIFS).
  - add options --warning, --error, --critical for missing log levels, #826.
    it's not recommended to suppress warnings or errors, but the user may decide
    this on his own.
    note: --warning is not given to borg serve so a <= 1.0.0 borg will still
    work as server (it is not needed as it is the default).
    do not use --error or --critical when using a <= 1.0.0 borg server.

  Bug fixes:

  - fix silently skipping EIO, #748
  - add context manager for Repository (avoid orphan repository locks), #285
  - do not sleep for >60s while waiting for lock, #773
  - unpack file stats before passing to FUSE
  - fix build on illumos
  - don't try to backup doors or event ports (Solaris and derivates)
  - remove useless/misleading libc version display, #738
  - test suite: reset exit code of persistent archiver, #844
  - RemoteRepository: clean up pipe if remote open() fails
  - Remote: don't print tracebacks for Error exceptions handled downstream, #792
  - if BORG_PASSPHRASE is present but wrong, don't prompt for password, but fail
    instead, #791
  - ArchiveChecker: move "orphaned objects check skipped" to INFO log level, #826
  - fix capitalization, add ellipses, change log level to debug for 2 messages,
    #798

  Other changes:

  - update llfuse requirement, llfuse 1.0 works
  - update OS / dist packages on build machines, #717
  - prefer showing --info over -v in usage help, #859
  - docs:

    - fix cygwin requirements (gcc-g++)
    - document how to debug / file filesystem issues, #664
    - fix reproducible build of api docs
    - RTD theme: CSS !important overwrite, #727
    - Document logo font. Recreate logo png. Remove GIMP logo file.

- rename package to borgbackup
- create/install html docs/man page
- remove dependency on python3-pytest-benchmark
