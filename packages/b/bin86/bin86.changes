- update to 0.16.17 (thanks to rschiele) 
  - Sorry forgot to flip this back: perror and strerror are back to using
    the /lib/liberror.txt file for all 8086 Elks modes. Only i386 has the
    file linked. Elksemu now traps accesses to this file and substitutes
    a fake.
  - Added vararg macros to new preprocessor.
  - Builtin CPP removed for __BCC__ compile, bcc-cc1 fit in 16bit but
    crashes. Thirty two bit works fine, gcc or bcc. (almost any 32bit.)
  - Added __BCC_VERSION__ macro, defined by bcc.c contains hex version no.
  - Bugfix for offsets generated by #asm when using -O option to bcc-cc1.
    Extra compile option ASM_USES_CALLEE_REGS.
  - Extra checking and bugfix for mixing char values with long shifts.
  - WARNING to distributions: I've altered the install scripts and paths
    you will want to check them.  Altered paths for bcc.c and normal
    installs, defaults should now be good for distributions where bcc is a
    cross compiler. If you set the PREFIX to / it'll install to suggested
    Native paths. As86_encap moved to LIBDIR.
  - I've altered 'perror' and 'strerror' to be normal when compiled for
    everything except libc_f.a. Only with that library will it look for the
    liberror.txt file and it now looks in "/lib/liberror.txt" only.
    This means there's no need to install it anywhere except ELKS itself.
  - Change -Mg option to use uclibc as glibc2 seems to have stopped working.
  - ar.c switch to using strerror.
  - Move elksemu, it's used like a shared library but is best treated like 
    an emulator so it's now installed in DISTBIN. Also on Linux-386 it's
    compiled using the system compiler.
  - Use the POSIX -R argument to cp rather than the normal standard -r because
    some new systems have decided to stop supporting their '-r' option.
  - Oops, the constant error strings in the assembler were char pointers not 
    char arrays, small waste of space.
  - Allow for Linux-2.6 32bit dev_t.
  - More changes so it compiles better on 'other' machines. 
    Removed some GNU-Make'isms in the top header file.
  - It seems that CYGWin's problem with _P is inherited from BSD. It also
    seems most of my problems come from BSD recently, haven't they realised
    that they down own the 'Unix Standard' anymore and haven't since SYSV
    got popular.
  - Some changes for cygwin, it isn't quite as nasty as compiling for minix
    but it doesn't miss by much!
  - Compiling for the 'tcc' complier, nice and easy.
  - Hitting bcc.c again, bcc-cpp now the default.
  - Some bugfixes for DEC Alpha -- 64 bit longs!
    Constant folding still done with 64bit longs though.
  - The fopen function (and friends) is now a real function not a macro.
  - Ctype.h updated to ansi.
  - Libraries appear to compile properly with -O and -ansi now.
  - Copt's hash string table adjusted; should now have fewer pathological cases.
  - Order of copt's rule processing reversed; it now works from the top of a
    rule file to the bottom. Also comment lines may be include in the match
    lines. !BCC_EOS added to bcc-cc1 for 'end of statment'.
  - bcc-cc1's asm("") now works in declare mode too.
  - New independed cpp added, has both K&R and Ansi modes.
    Changes made to the embedded cpp too to try and fix some bad bits.
  - Conditional assembler added around push and pop of 'si' and 'di' if the
    optimiser (and as86's optimiser) are to be run.
  - Signed keyword added to bcc-cc1 for 'signed char' also works with other
    int types but is usually just a noiseword.
  - As86 macro syntax altered, you now don't have to include any brackets.
  - Gcc warnings in ar86 cleaned up.
  - Mk_dist now makes incremental patch files too.
  - Update magic file.
  - Various updates to the bios libc, the vt52 and ansi emulations are
    now seperated (and can be both included if needed) and don't have
    to be linked. Conio functions work properly in bios and msdos.
  - Added -v (version)
  - as86 and ld86 now delete their binary outputs if there were errors.
  - Added more 'set' commands generated by '#asm' lines. The new ones begin
    with '.' rather than '_' an are based off the 'bp' register rather than
    the 'sp' register.
  - Various unused, test and old document files removed.
  - as86 modified to use normal malloc routines - no longer has limited 
    input file size.
  - as6809 repaired, appears to work.
  - as86 error display adjusted, some errors demoted to warnings.
  - Complete re-write of bcc.c driver program. Should now be easier to
    modify, does have more versatility so that things that were formerly
    compile time options are all run time.
  - #asm and #endasm now interact with statment processing inside functions.
    If statments and case labels no longer need special layout however #asm
    must be placed between statments now.
  - The __heap_top virtual constant added, allows the -H option to be used
    with the -d option in the linker.
  - Conio routines added, merged with bios_getc/bios_putc routines which
    now no longer exist under those names.
  - monitor.out now copes with very old zimages, like the memtest86 program,
    and has 'Retry' prompt for disk errors.
  - msdos.s and tarboot.s loading of non-a.out executables adjusted for 
    dos BIN like files.
  - Standalone library startup adjusted to allow execution of a '-d' 
    executable from DOS, if __argr.x.cflag is set this is running under
    DOS.
  - Compile for DOS again, disable cpm86 headers under DOS.
  - Minor bugfix for as86 binary output re sizeof(int)/K&R problem.
