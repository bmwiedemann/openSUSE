Fri Jan 31 20:43:35 UTC 2025 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 0.16.0:
  + Added:
    - Added more "go to reference" implementations in the language
      server
    - Added semantic token support for flag members in the language
      server
    - Added property documentation to the hover tooltip for notify
      signals
    - The language server now shows relevant sections of the
      reference documentation when hovering over keywords and
      symbols
    - Added not-swapped flag to signal handlers, which may be
      needed for signal handlers that specify an object
    - Added expression literals, which allow you to specify a
      Gtk.Expression property (as opposed to the existing
      expression support, which is for property bindings)
  + Changed:
    - The formatter adds trailing commas to lists
    - The formatter removes trailing whitespace from comments
    - Autocompleting a commonly translated property automatically
      adds the _("") syntax
    - Marking a single-quoted string as translatable now generates
      a warning, since gettext does not recognize it when using the
      configuration recommended in the blueprint documentation
  + Fixed:
    - Added support for libgirepository-2.0 so that blueprint
      doesn't crash due to import conflicts on newer versions of
      PyGObject
    - Fixed a bug when decompiling/porting files with enum values
    - Fixed several issues where tests would fail with versions of
      GTK that added new deprecations
    - Addressed a problem with the language server protocol in some
      editors
    - Fixed an issue where the compiler would crash instead of
      reporting compiler errors
    - Fixed a crash in the language server that occurred when a
      detailed signal (e.g. notify::*) was not complete
    - The language server now properly implements the shutdown
      command, fixing support for some editors and improving
      robustness when restarting
    - Marking a string in an array as translatable now generates an
      error, since it doesn't work
  + Documentation:
    - Added mention of null in the Literal Values section
    - Add apps to Built with Blueprint section
    - Corrected and updated many parts of the documentation

 * Added an option to not print the diff when formatting with the CLI.
 * Added support for building Gtk.ColumnViewRow, Gtk.ColumnViewCell,
 * and Gtk.ListHeader widgets with Gtk.BuilderListItemFactory.
 * Added support for the after keyword for signals. This was previously
 * documented but not implemented.

 * Added hover documentation for properties in lookup expressions.

 * syntax, and expressions. It also supports extension syntax for
 * Adw.Breakpoint, Gtk.BuilderListItemFactory, Gtk.ComboBoxText,
 * Gtk.SizeGroup, and Gtk.StringList.
 * Added a decompile subcommand to the CLI, which decompiles an XML .ui
 * file to blueprint.
 * Accessibility relations that allow multiple values are supported
 * using list syntax.
 * The decompiler sorts imports alphabetically.
 * Translatable strings use translatable="yes" instead of translatable="true"
 * for compatibility with xgettext.
 * The first line of the documentation is shown in the completion list
 * when using the language server.
 * Object autocomplete uses a snippet to add the braces and position the
 * cursor inside them.
 * The carets in the CLI diagnostic output now span the whole error
 * message up to the end of the first line, rather than just the first
 * character.
 * The decompiler emits double quotes, which are compatible with gettext.
 * Fixed deprecation warnings in the language server.
 * The decompiler no longer duplicates translator comments on properties.
 * Subtemplates no longer output a redundant @generated comment.
 * When extension syntax from a library that is not available is used,
 * the compiler emits an error instead of crashing.
 * The language server reports semantic token positions correctly.
 * The decompiler no longer emits the deprecated bind-property syntax.
 * Fixed the tests when used as a Meson subproject.
 * Signal autocomplete generates correct syntax.
 * The decompiler supports templates that do not specify a parent class.
 * Adw.Breakpoint setters that set a property on the template no longer cause a crash.
 * Fixed type checking with templates that do not have a parent class.
 * Fixed online documentation links for interfaces.
 * The wording of edit suggestions is fixed for insertions and deletions.
 * When an input file uses tabs instead of spaces, the diagnostic output
 * on the CLI aligns the caret correctly.
 * The decompiler emits correct syntax when a property binding refers to
 * the template object.
 * Fixed typos in "Built with Blueprint" section.
- build documentation
- remove tests, as they fail on obs, but work otherwise fine when build locally

    `"800"` is no longer an accepted value for an integer type).
  + Boxed types are now type checked.
  + Added: There is now syntax for `GType` literals: the `typeof()`

    property which is now specifiable like this:
