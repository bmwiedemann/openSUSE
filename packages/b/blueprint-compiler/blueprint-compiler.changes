- Update to version 0.6.0:
  + Quoted and numeric literals are no longer interchangeable (e.g.
    `"800"` is no longer an accepted value for an integer type).
  + Boxed types are now type checked.
  + Added: There is now syntax for `GType` literals: the `typeof()`
    pseudo-function. For example, list stores have an `item-type`
    property which is now specifiable like this:
    `item-type: typeof(.MyDataModel)`.
  + The language server now logs to stderr.
  + Fix the build on Windows, where backslashes in paths were not
    escaped. (William Roy)
  + Remove the syntax for specifying menu objects inline,
    since it does not work.
  + Fix a crash in the language server that was triggered in files
    with incomplete `using Gtk 4.0;` statements.
  + Fixed compilation on big-endian systems.
  + Fix an issue in the interactive port tool that would lead to
    missed files. (Frank Dana)
  + Fix an issue for documentation contributors where changing the
    documentation files would not trigger a rebuild.
  + Document the missing support for Gtk.Label `<attributes>`,
    which is intentional, and recommend alternatives. (Sonny Piers)
  + Add a prominent warning that Blueprint is still experimental
