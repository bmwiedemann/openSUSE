  <title>Crack legacy zip encryption with Biham and Kocher's known plaintext attack</title>
  <description>bkcrack is a command-line tool which implements a known plaintext attack
against legacy encrypted ZIP archives. The vulnerability was shown by Eli Biham
and Paul C. Kocher in the research paper &quot;A known plaintext attack on the PKZIP
stream cipher.&quot; The main features are:

* Recover internal state from ciphertext and plaintext.
* Remove or change a ZIP archive's password using the internal state.
* Recover the original password from the internal state.</description>
