Sun Aug  8 19:12:41 UTC 2021 - Jaime Marquínez Ferrándiz <jaime.marquinez.ferrandiz@fastmail.net>

- Update to 3.0.1:
  * Improved tuning of scrolling speed.
  * Improved handling of fonts to fix many bugs, including a switch to Qt's
    native font chooser widget in settings dialog, because of many serious bugs
    in our legacy implementation.
  * Improved sample text in settings dialog.
  * Improved behavior of the mag view to be more similar to pre-3.0 behavior.
  * Increased maximum column count from 4 to 10.
  * Removed the orphaned and broken tests for BibleTime.
  * Updated translations, including a new user interface translations to
    Japanese and Ukrainian, a new Handbook translation to Russian, and a new
    Howto translation to Ukrainian.
  * Fixed DisplayView.qml getting incorrectly installed under /usr/bin/ on some
    platforms.
  * Fixed some compatibility issues with different Qt versions.
  * Fixed a crash when editing personal commentary.
  * Fixed highlighting of selected text.
  * Fixed dragging of links.
  * Fixed modules rearranging themselves.
  * Fixed logic related to clicking on verse numbers.
  * Fixed custom font of first column being incorrectly applied to all columns.
  * Fixed preview in settings dialog displaying text in red.
  * Fixed lexicons not being displayed.
  * Fixed drag and drop in mag view and search dialog.
  * Fixed no text being displayed for some ThML modules.
  * Fixed undefined behavior and crashes from opening menus to select works by
    working around a broken QMenu interface (QTBUG-77273).
  * Fixes to handling of languages, including a caching discrepancy which
    caused some settings not being properly applied before restarting
    BibleTime.
  * Fixed saving of chapters not working properly.
  * Fixed handling of nested tags for OSIS works.
  * Fixes to handling of PageUp/PageDown keys when scrolling out of bounds.
    Note that when BibleTime is compiled against Qt 5.9, one might still
    experience a trivial glitch where only part of the module is displayed.
    Pressing PageUp/PageDown again may help to work around this.
