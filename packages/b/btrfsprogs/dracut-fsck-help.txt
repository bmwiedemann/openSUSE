Recovery of btrfs file systems is not automated. We suggest you use
'btrfs check --readonly' first to see the if there's any damage and
what's the scope. Logging the output is a recommended for later analysis.

The option '--repair' must be used with care, be noted that it is
able to fix certain classes of errors but not all of them.
