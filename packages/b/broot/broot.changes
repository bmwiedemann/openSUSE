Tue Apr  1 11:30:34 UTC 2025 - Martin Sirringhaus <martin.sirringhaus@suse.com>

- v1.45.1
  * Fix compilation failing without `--locked`

- v1.45.0
  *  Fix total search impossible to redo after refresh
  * With `refresh_after: false`, a verb configuration can request that the tree isn't refreshed after its execution

- v1.44.7
  * fix bad regex match position
  * update resvg dependency to 0.44
  * on `--server`, remove the existing socket if it already exists

- v1.44.6
  * fix .ignore files ignored when not in a git repository
  * update git2 dependency to 0.20

- v1.44.5
  * no real change (just reverting a crate name to ease some packaging)

- v1.44.4
  * fix panic in preview on syntax coloring (when a sublime syntax isn't compatible with the regex engine)

- v1.44.3
  * removed default bindings on left and right keys. You may add them back by adding this to your verbs.hjson:
    { key: "left", internal: "back" }
    { key: "right", internal: "open_stay" }
  * rustc minimal version changed from 1.76 to 1.79, which allows better performing image rendering
  * remove dependency to onig, to allow compatibility with gcc 15

- v1.44.2
  * temp files created for kitty now erased on quitting or when too many of them have been written
  * no longer panics when launched with BROOT_LOG=debug but the broot.log file can't be created
  * fix user and group names displayed as "????" when coming from openldap

- v1.44.1
  * fix wrong position of IMEs (input method editors) popup - See #948
  * improve querying the terminal for capabilities (prevent some escape chars from leaking)

- v1.44.0
  * `:focus_staging_area_no_open` internal, focus the staging area if it's already open, does nothing in other case
  * fix some composite patterns with several operators and no parenthesis

- v1.43.0
  * 'Size' and 'Deletion date' columns in trash screen. This screen now supports the `:toggle_date`, `:toggle_size`, `:sort_by_date`, and `:sort_by_size` internals.
  * new `:show` internal make the provided path visible and selected, adding lines to the tree if necessary, does nothing if the provided path is not a descendant of the current tree root (this part may change depending on feedback)

- v1.42.0
  * support of `.ignore` files with the same syntax than `.gitignore`. They have priority over `.gitignore` so that a personal `.ignore` file can override a shared `.gitignore` - See https://dystroy.org/broot/tree_view/#hidden-ignored-files
  * `:toggle_ignore` internal, identical to `:toggle_git_ignore`, but with a clearer name so should be preferred
  * the `panels` verb filter now works in most contexts (it was previously only checked on key events)
  * many dependencies updated

- v1.41.1
  * allow compilation with rustc 1.76

- v1.41.0
  * Major Feature: :search_again
    - ctrl-s now triggers `:search_again` which either
    - brings back the last used search pattern, when no filtering pattern is active
    - does a "total search" if a filtering pattern is active and the search wasn't complete
  * Major Feature: internals changing panel widths
    - `set_panel_width`, taking as parameter the index of the panel and the desired width
    - `move_panel_divider`, taking as parameter the index of the divider and the desired change
    - `ctrl-<` is bound by default to `:move_panel_divider 0 -1`
    - `ctrl->` is bound by default to `:move_panel_divider 0 1`
    - See http://dystroy.org/broot/panels/#resize-panels
  * Minor Changes:
    - when git file infos are shown, and git ignored files aren't hidden, those files are flagged with a 'I'
    - Remove .bak extension from content search exclusion list
    - Update nerdfont and vscode icons
    - `{initial-root}` verb argument

- v1.40.0
  * Major Feature: preview transformers
    You can now define preview transformers to be applied before preview.
    They allow for example previewing PDF or Office files, or beautifying JSON files.
    Edit the `preview_transformers` array in your conf.hjson file.
    See https://dystroy.org/broot/conf_file/#preview
  * fix search on root
  * fix some verb cycling problems

- v1.39.2
  * fix UNC paths being displayed on Windows (regression at 1.39.1)

- v1.39.1
  * fix high-resolution (kitty protocole) image broken in release mode
  * canonicalize paths when focusing them (mostly useful when following links)
  * a few minor internal optimizations
