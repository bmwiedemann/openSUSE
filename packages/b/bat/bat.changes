Mon May  4 14:55:12 UTC 2020 - Martin Rey <mrey@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.15.0
  * Features
    - This release adds a new --diff/-d option that can be used to
      only show lines surrounding Git changes, i.e. added, removed
      or modified lines. The amount of additional context can be
      controlled with --diff-context=N. See #23 and #940
  * Bugfixes
    - Error message printed in the middle of the output for another
      file, see #946
      Performance improvements when using custom caches (via bat
      cache --build): the bat startup time should now be twice as
      fast.
  * Themes
    - Updated version of the Solarized dark/light themes, see #941
  * bat as a library
    - There are a few changes in the "low level" API (the Config
      struct has changed andthe error handler needs a new &mut dyn
      Write argument). The high-level API is not affected.

- Changes from version 0.14.0
  * Features
    - Added a new --file-name <name>… option to overwrite the
      displayed filename(s) in the header. This is useful when
      piping input into bat. See #654 and #892.
    - Added a new --generate-config-file option to create an
      initial configuration file at the right place. See #870.
  * Bugfixes
    - Performance problems with C# source code have been fixed, see
      #677
    - Performance problems with Makefiles have been fixed, see #750
    - Fix bug when highlighting Ruby files with unindented heredocs
      , see #914
    - A highlighting problem with Rust source code has been fixed,
      see #924
    - --highlight-line did not work correctly in combination with
      --tabs=0 and --wrap=never, see #937
  * Other
    - When saving/reading user-provided syntaxes or themes, bat
      will now maintain a metadata.yaml file which includes
      information about the bat version which was used to create
      the cached files. When loading cached files, we now print an
      error if they have been created with an incompatible version.
      See #882
    - Updated liquid dependency to 0.20, see #880
  * bat as a library
    - A completely new "high level" API has been added that is much
      more convenient to use. See the examples folder for the
      updated code. It is recommended to only use the new
      "high level" API, if possible. Note that this should still
      be considered a "beta" release of bat-as-a-library.
      For more details and some screenshots of the example
      programs, see #936.
    - Stripped out a lot of binary-only dependencies, see #895 and
      #899
    - Allow using the library with older syntect, see #896 and #898
  * New syntaxes
    - Rego, see #872
    - Stylo, see #917
