%description
This is a helper utility to work with patches made available via a
public-inbox archive like lore.kernel.org. It is written to make it
easier to participate in a patch-based workflows, like those used in
the Linux kernel development.

The name "b4" was chosen for ease of typing and because B-4 was the
precursor to Lore and Data in the Star Trek universe.
