# For SLE12 by default CUPS 1.7.5 is provided and alternatively CUPS 1.5.4 is provided in the "legacy" module.
# For SLE12 build it with traditional CUPS 1.5.4 to ensure it works on SLE12 both with CUPS 1.7.5 and CUPS 1.5.4
# because libcups and libcupsimage in CUPS 1.7.5 are backward compatible with CUPS 1.5.4 so that applications
# that have been built with CUPS 1.5.4 also work under CUPS 1.7.5 but the libraries in CUPS 1.7.5 provide
# some additional functions so that applications that have been built with CUPS 1.7.5 and use those
# additional functions would not work under CUPS 1.7.5.
# Only in the Printing project for SLE12 use cups154-ddk (a sub package of the cups154-SLE12 source package):

%description
Boomaga (BOOklet MAnager) is a virtual printer for viewing a document
before printing it out using the physical printer.
Select the "Boomaga" printer in any program and the Boomaga window
opens in several seconds (CUPS takes some time to respond).
If you print out one more document, it gets added to the previous one,
and you can also print them out as one.
Regardless of whether your printer supports duplex printing or not, you
would be able to easily print on both sides of the sheet.
