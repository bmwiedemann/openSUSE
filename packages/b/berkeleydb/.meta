  <title>Berkeley DB Java Edition</title>
  <description>Berkeley DB Java Edition is a high performance, transactional storage
engine written entirely in Java. Like the highly successful Berkeley DB
product, Berkeley DB Java Edition executes in the address space of the
application, without the overhead of client/server communication. It
stores data in the application's native format, so no runtime data
translation is required. Berkeley DB Java Edition supports full ACID
transactions and recovery. It provides an easy-to-use, programmatic
interface, allowing developers to store and retrieve information
quickly, simply and reliably.</description>
