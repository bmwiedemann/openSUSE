%description
Blogbench is a portable filesystem benchmark that tries to reproduce the load
of a real-world busy file server. It stresses the filesystem with multiple
threads performing random reads, writes, and rewrites in order to get a
realistic idea of the scalability and the concurrency a system can handle.
