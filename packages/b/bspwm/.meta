  <description>A tiling window manager based on binary space partitioning.
* It only responds to X events, and the messages it receives on a dedicated socket.
* bspc is a program that writes messages on bspwm's socket.
* bspwm doesn't handle any keyboard or pointer inputs: a third party program (e.g. sxhkd) is needed in order to translate keyboard and pointer events to bspc invocations.</description>
