Mon Nov 30 21:45:58 UTC 2020 - Avindra Goolcharan <avindra@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 0.9.10:
  + Additions
  - New node descriptor: first_ancestor.
  - New node modifiers: horizontal, vertical.
  + Changes
  - The node descriptors next and prev might now return any node.
    The previous behavior can be emulated by appending .!hidden.window.
  - The node descriptors pointed, biggest and smallest now return
    leaves (in particular pointed will now return the id of a
    pointed receptacle). The previous behavior can be emulated by
    appending .window.
  - The query command now handles all the possible descriptor-free
    constraints (for example, query -N -d .active now works as
    expected).
  - The rules can now match against the window's names (WM_NAME).
  - The configuration script now receives an argument to indicate
    whether is was executed after a restart or not.
  - The intermediate consequences passed to the external rules
    command are now in resolved form to avoid unwanted
    code execution.
- Package config to /etc/.skel
- Ran spec-cleaner

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun 10 11:45:45 UTC 2020 - Florian Besser <fbesser@gmail.com>

- Update to version 0.9.9:
  * Fix a memory allocation bug in the implementation of wm --restart.
  * Honor single_monocle when the hidden flag is toggled.
- includes 0.9.8:
  * Fix a potential infinite loop.
  * Fix two bugs having to do with single_monocle.
  * Honor removal_adjustment for the spiral automatic insertion scheme.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun 10 11:40:56 UTC 2020 - Florian Besser <fbesser@gmail.com>

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 22 13:38:58 UTC 2019 - Xaver Hellauer <xaver@hellauer.bayern>

- Fix suggestions for bspwm-fish-completion

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb 27 04:42:35 UTC 2019 - Luke Jones <jones_ld@protonmail.com>

- Update 0.9.7:
  * Bug fix for "single_monocle does not work for the first node on
  a desktop"
- From 0.9.5 to 0.9.6
- Additions
  * New wm command: --restart. It was already possible to restart
    bspwm without loosing the current state through
    --{dump,load}-state, but this command will also keep the
    existing subscribers intact.
  * New settings: automatic_scheme, removal_adjustment.
    The automatic insertion mode now provides three ways of
    inserting a new node: spiral, longest_side (the default)
    and alternate. Those schemes are described in the README.
  * New settings: ignore_ewmh_struts, presel_feedback,
    {top,right,bottom,left}_monocle_padding.
  * New node descriptor: smallest.
  * New desktop modifier: active.
- Changes
  * The focused and active modifiers now mean the same
    thing across every object.
  * Fullscreen windows are no longer sent to the above layer.
    Within the same layer, fullscreen windows are now above floating
    windows. If you want a floating window to be above a fullscreen
    window, you'll need to rely on layers.
  * Pseudo-tiled windows now shrink automatically.
- Removals
  * The paddingless_monocle setting was removed (and subsumed).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr 11 21:37:19 UTC 2018 - avindra@opensuse.org

- Update to 0.9.5
  * Fix resize by mouse behavioral change
  * Disable 4 default options (IGNORE_EWMH_FOCUS,
    REMOVE_DISABLED_MONITORS, REMOVE_UNPLUGGED_MONITORS,
    MERGE_OVERLAPPING_MONITORS)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar 29 02:52:28 UTC 2018 - avindra@opensuse.org

- Update to 0.9.4
- Changes
  * The following events: node_{manage,unmanage} are now
    node_{add,remove}.
- Additions
  * New monitor/desktop/node descriptors: any, newest.
  * New node flag: marked.
  * New monitor descriptor: pointed.
  * New wm command: --reorder-monitors.
  * Receptacles are now described in the manual.
  * New --follow option added to node -{m,d,n,s} and desktop
    -{m,s}.
  * The subscribe command now has the following options: --fifo,
    --count.
  * New settings: ignore_ewmh_fullscreen, mapping_events_count.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 27 15:02:43 UTC 2018 - avindra@opensuse.org

- split completion scripts into sub-packages
- fix lint errors
- cleanup with spec-cleaner
- compile with %optflags
- delete _service file
- remove manual desktop database config

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Sep 24 16:47:38 UTC 2017 - aavindraa@gmail.com

- Created _service file
- Update to 0.9.3
- Changes
    * *click_to_focus* is now a button name. Specifying a boolean is
      deprecated but will still work (`true` is equivalent to `button1`).

- Additions
    * `node -r` now accepts a relative fraction argument.
    * An option was added to `query -{M,D,N}` in order to output names
      instead of IDs: `--names`.
    * New rule consequence: `rectangle=WxH+X+Y`.
    * New settings: `swallow_first_click` and `directional_focus_tightness`.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb 10 03:32:17 UTC 2017 - luke.nukem.jones@gmail.com

- Update to 0.9.2
- Changes
    * Monitors, desktops and nodes have unique IDs, `bspc query -{N,D,M}`
      returns IDs and events reference objects by ID instead of name.
    * `bspc` fails verbosely and only returns a single non-zero exit code.
    * The `DIR` descriptor is based on [right-window](https://github.com/ntrrgc/right-window).
    * The `CYCLE_DIR` descriptor isn't limited to the current
      desktop/monitor anymore. (You can emulate the previous behavior
      by appending a `.local` modifier to the selector.)
    * `bspc query -{N,D,M}` accepts an optional reference argument
      used by certain descriptors/modifiers.
    * Monitors are ordered visually by default.
    * The following settings: `border_width`, `window_gap` and
      `*_padding` behave as expected.
    * External rules also receives the monitor, desktop and node
      selectors computed from the built-in rules stage as subsequent arguments.
    * The `focus_follows_pointer` setting is implemented via enter
      notify events.

- Additions
    * Nodes can be hidden/shown via the new `hidden` flag.
    * Node receptacles can be inserted with `node -i`. An example
      is given in `git show e8aa679`.
    * Non-tiled nodes can be moved/resized via `node -{v,z}`.
    * The reference of a selector can be set via the `{NODE,DESKTOP
      ,MONITOR}_SEL#` prefix, example: `bspc node 0x0080000c#south -c`
      will close the node at the south of `0x0080000c`.
    * Node descriptors: `<node_id>`, `pointed`.
    * Node modifiers: `hidden`, `descendant_of`, `ancestor_of`, `window`,
      `active`. Example: `bspc query -N 0x00400006 -n .descendant_of` returns
      the descendants of `0x00400006`.
    * Desktop descriptor: `<desktop_id>`.
    * Monitor descriptor: `<monitor_id>`.
    * Settings: `pointer_motion_interval`, `pointer_modifier`,
      `pointer_action{1,2,3}`, `click_to_focus`, `honor_size_hints`.
    * Event: `pointer_action`.
    * ICCCM/EWMH atoms: `WM_STATE`, `_NET_WM_STRUT_PARTIAL`.
    * `bspc` shell completions for `fish`.

- Removals
    * The `pointer` domain. Pointer actions are handled internally.
    You need to remove any binding that uses this domain from your
    `sxhkdrc`.
    * Settings: `history_aware_focus`, `focus_by_distance`. Both
      settings are merged into the new `DIR` implementation.
    * `monitor -r|--remove-desktops`: use `desktop -r|--remove` instead.
    * `wm -r|--remove-monitor`: use `monitor -r|--remove` instead.
