  <title>The BOINC client core</title>
  <description>The Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) is an open-
source software platform which supports distributed computing, primarily in
the form of &quot;volunteer&quot; computing and &quot;desktop Grid&quot; computing.  It is well
suited for problems which are often described as &quot;trivially parallel&quot;.  BOINC
is the underlying software used by projects such as SETI@home, Einstein@Home,
ClimatePrediciton.net, the World Community Grid, and many other distributed
computing projects.

This package installs the BOINC client software, which will allow your
computer to participate in one or more BOINC projects, using your spare
computer time to search for cures for diseases, model protein folding, study
global warming, discover sources of gravitational waves, and many other types
of scientific and mathematical research.</description>
