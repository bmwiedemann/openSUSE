    Basic installation

Installs BOINC Client as a daemon (autostarts the BOINC client at boot
time) and puts a BOINC Manager icon on the applications menu. The steps
are:

   1. Open a terminal, enter |su|, give the root password when prompted.
   2. Enter |zypper install boinc-client boinc-manager|
      (be patient while the BOINC package downloads and installs).
   3. Optional: after the installation is finished, enter
      |/usr/bin/systemctl enable boinc-client.service|
      to have Linux auto-start the boinc-client daemon at boot time.
      (See Stop or start BOINC daemon after boot
       page for helpful
      commands for managing the daemon) 


    What the installer does

   1. Creates a systemd configuration file for boinc-client.service.
   2. Places the BOINC binaries (boinc-client, boinccmd, boinc-gui
      and boincmgr) in /usr/bin/.
   3. Creates /var/lib/boinc/ for BOINC data files and the slots and
      projects directories.
   4. Names the daemon boinc-client.
   5. Creates a user named boinc. For security, boinc owns the BOINC
      data directory (/var/lib/boinc/) and all the data files and
      sub-directories it creates in the data directory. 


    Verify the installation

   1. If you elected to have Linux start the daemon at boot time (see
      step 3 in section Basic installation), logout and reboot Linux now
      and login under your normal user account.
   2. If you elected to not have Linux start the daemon at boot time,
      start the daemon manually with |/usr/bin/systemctl start boinc-client.service |
   3. Open a terminal and enter |ps aux | grep boinc| to print a partial
      list of running processes. You should see |boinc-client --dir ...|
      in that list, if not then something went wrong in the steps above. 


    Set up your accounts

To use the GUI to set up your accounts and monitor progress:

    * Start "boincmgr" on the command line or select Applications ->
      System Tools -> Boinc Manager from the GNOME menu.
    * Select Advanced -> Select computer... from the Boinc Manager menu.
    * Put "localhost" in for "Host name" and the contents of
      /var/lib/boinc/gui_rpc_auth.cfg for "Password" and hit "OK". 

If you do only the basic installation as described above, BOINC manager
will not be able to automatically connect to the client. To connect the
client you will be required to give the GUI RPC password every time you
start BOINC manager. That is not a bug, it is a security feature to
prevent other users from using the manager to manipulate the client,
change your projects, etc.

If you don't want to put the password every time you run the BOINC
manager, you can:

   1. disable the password at all [*not recommended*]
      To make the GUI passwordless, do "echo >
      /var/lib/boinc/gui_rpc_auth.cfg" (which replaces the contents of
      the file with a newline) and then restart boinc-client (with e.g.
      "/sbin/service boinc-client restart").
   2. *with boinc-client-6.4.7-1.r17542svn and newer* it is enough if
      you just add your user account into the "boinc" group, e.g. by
      typing |/usr/sbin/usermod -G boinc -a username|
   3. *with older versions* the procedure is a bit more complicated:
      Boinc (the user named boinc) owns /var/lib/boinc/ and all the
      files and directories in it so you will not be able to edit those
      files easily from your regular user account. The steps below add
      your username to the boinc group and adjust some permissions so
      that BOINC manager will automatically connect to BOINC client
      whenever you start the manager from your regular Linux user
      account. Also you will be able to edit files in the BOINC
      directory without becoming root. As you type in each command
      below, substitute your Linux username wherever you see |username|.
      Enter the following commands in a terminal, as root:
         1. |/usr/sbin/usermod -A boinc username|
         2. |chmod g+rw /var/lib/boinc|
         3. |chmod g+rw /var/lib/boinc/*.*|
         4. |ln -s /var/lib/boinc/gui_rpc_auth.cfg
            /home/username/gui_rpc_auth.cfg|
         5. |chown boinc:boinc /home/username/gui_rpc_auth.cfg| 


    Uninstallation

As root, in a terminal, enter

 yum remove boinc-client boinc-manager


    Known problems

boinc-client sometimes has problems connecting to the network, if the
network connection comes up after the client has already started. This
is a known BOINC bug, which is filed as #707.

In the meantime, you can fix this by restarting boinc-client. On the
command line as root, do "/usr/bin/systemctl restart boinc-client.service".
Alternatively, from the GNOME menu, you can choose System ->
Administration -> Services and then stop and start the boinc-client
service.
