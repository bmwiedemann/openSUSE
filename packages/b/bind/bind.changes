- Upgrade to release 9.20.5
  Security Fixes:
  * DNS-over-HTTPS flooding fixes.
    Fix DNS-over-HTTPS implementation issues that arise under heavy
    query load. Optimize resource usage for named instances that
    accept queries over DNS-over-HTTPS.
    Previously, named processed all incoming HTTP/2 data at once,
    which could overwhelm the server, especially when dealing with
    clients that sent requests but did not wait for responses. That
    has been fixed. Now, named handles HTTP/2 data in smaller
    chunks and throttles reading until the remote side reads the
    response data. It also throttles clients that send too many
    requests at once.
    In addition, named now evaluates excessive streams opened by
    clients that include no DNS data, which is considered
    “flooding.” It logs these clients and drops connections from
    them.
    In some cases, named could leave DNS-over-HTTPS connections in
    the CLOSE_WAIT state indefinitely. That has also been fixed.
    (CVE-2024-12705)
    [bsc#1236597]
  * Limit additional section processing for large RDATA sets.
    When answering queries, don’t add data to the additional
    section if the answer has more than 13 names in the RDATA. This
    limits the number of lookups into the database(s) during a
    single client query, reducing the query-processing load.
    (CVE-2024-11187)
    [bsc#1236596]

  New Features:
  * Add Extended DNS Error Code 22 - No Reachable Authority.
    When the resolver is trying to query an authoritative server
    and eventually times out, a SERVFAIL answer is given to the
    client. Add the Extended DNS Error Code 22 - No Reachable
    Authority to the response.
  * Add a new option to configure the maximum number of outgoing
    queries per client request.
    The configuration option max-query-count sets how many outgoing
    queries per client request are allowed. The existing
    max-recursion-queries value is the number of permissible
    queries for a single name and is reset on every CNAME
    redirection. This new option is a global limit on the client
    request. The default is 200.
    The default for max-recursion-queries is changed from 32 to 50.
    This allows named to send a few more queries while looking up a
    single name.
  * Use the Server Name Indication (SNI) extension for all outgoing
    TLS connections.
    This improves compatibility with other DNS server software.

  Feature Changes:
  * Performance optimization for NSEC3 lookups introduced in BIND
    9.20.2 was reverted to avoid risks associated with a complex
    code change.
  * The configuration clauses parental-agents and primaries are
    renamed to remote-servers.
    The top blocks primaries and parental-agents are no longer
    preferred and should be renamed to remote-servers. The zone
    statements parental-agents and primaries are still used, and
    may refer to any remote-servers top block.
  * Add none parameter to query-source and query-source-v6 to
    disable IPv4 or IPv6 upstream queries but allow listening to
    queries from clients on IPv4 or IPv6.

  Bug Fixes:
  * Fix nsupdate hang when processing a large update.
    To mitigate DNS flood attacks over a single TCP connection,
    throttle the connection when the other side does not read the
    data. Throttling should only occur on server-side sockets, but
    erroneously also happened for nsupdate, which acts as a client.
    When nsupdate started throttling the connection, it never
    attempted to read again. This has been fixed.
  * Fix possible assertion failure when reloading server while
    processing update policy rules.
  * Preserve cache across reconfig when using attach-cache.
    When the attach-cache option is used in the options block with
    an arbitrary name, it causes all views to use the same cache.
    Previously, this configuration caused the cache to be deleted
    and a new cache to be created every time the server was
    reconfigured. This has been fixed.
  * Resolve the spurious drops in performance due to glue cache.
    For performance reasons, the returned glue records are cached
    on the first use. The current implementation could randomly
    cause a performance drop and increased memory use. This has
    been fixed.
  * Fix dnssec-signzone signing non-DNSKEY RRsets with revoked
    keys.
    dnssec-signzone was using revoked keys for signing RRsets other
    than DNSKEY. This has been corrected.
  * Fix improper handling of unknown directives in resolv.conf.
    The line after an unknown directive in resolv.conf could
    accidentally be skipped, potentially affecting dig, host,
    nslookup, nsupdate, or delv. This has been fixed.
  * Fix response policy zones and catalog zones with an $INCLUDE
    statement defined.
    Response policy zones (RPZ) and catalog zones were not working
    correctly if they had an $INCLUDE statement defined. This has
    been fixed

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec 12 12:38:04 UTC 2024 - Jorik Cronenberg <jorik.cronenberg@suse.com>

- Add new dlz-modules source
- Update to release 9.20.4
  New Features:
  * Update built-in bind.keys file with the new 2025 IANA root key.
  * Add an initial-ds entry to bind.keys for the new root key, ID
    38696, which is scheduled for publication in January 2025.

  Removed Features:
  * Move contributed DLZ modules into a separate repository. DLZ
    modules should not be used except in testing.
  * The DLZ modules were not maintained, the DLZ interface itself
    is going to be scheduled for removal, and the DLZ interface is
    blocking. Any module that blocks the query to the database
    blocks the whole server.
  * The DLZ modules now live in
    https://gitlab.isc.org/isc-projects/dlz-modules repository.

  Feature Changes:
  * dnssec-ksr now supports KSK rollovers.
  * The tool now allows for KSK generation, as well as planned KSK
    rollovers. When signing a bundle from a Key Signing Request
    (KSR), only the key that is active in that time frame is used
    for signing. Also, the CDS and CDNSKEY records are now added
    and removed at the correct time.
  * Print RFC 7314: EXPIRE option in transfer summary.
  * Emit more helpful log messages for exceeding
    max-records-per-type.
  * The new log message is emitted when adding or updating an RRset
    fails due to exceeding the max-records-per-type limit. The log
    includes the owner name and type, corresponding zone name, and
    the limit value. It will be emitted on loading a zone file,
    inbound zone transfer (both AXFR and IXFR), handling a DDNS
    update, or updating a cache DB. It’s especially helpful in the
    case of zone transfer, since the secondary side doesn’t have
    direct access to the offending zone data.
  * It could also be used for max-types-per-name, but this change
    doesn’t implement it yet as it’s much less likely to happen in
    practice.
  * Harden key management when key files have become unavailable.
  * Prior to doing key management, BIND 9 will check if the key
    files on disk match the expected keys. If key files for
    previously observed keys have become unavailable, this will
    prevent the internal key manager from running.

  Bug Fixes:
  * Use TLS for notifies if configured to do so.
  * Notifies configured to use TLS will now be sent over TLS,
    instead of plain text UDP or TCP. Also, failing to load the TLS
    configuration for notify now results in an error.
  * {&dns} is as valid as {?dns} in a SVCB’s dohpath.
  * dig failed to parse a valid SVCB record with a dohpath URI
    template containing a {&dns}, like
    dohpath=/some/path?key=value{&dns}”.
  * Fix NSEC3 closest encloser lookup for names with empty
    non-terminals.
  * A previous performance optimization for finding the NSEC3
    closest encloser when generating authoritative responses could
    cause servers to return incorrect NSEC3 records in some cases.
    This has been fixed.
  * recursive-clients statement with value 0 triggered an assertion
    failure.
  * BIND 9.20.0 broke recursive-clients 0;. This has now been
    fixed.
  * Parsing of hostnames in rndc.conf was broken.
  * When DSCP support was removed, parsing of hostnames in
    rndc.conf was accidentally broken, resulting in an assertion
    failure. This has been fixed.
  * dig options of the form [+-]option=<value> failed to display
    the value on the printed command line. This has been fixed.
  * Provide more visibility into TLS configuration errors by
    logging SSL_CTX_use_certificate_chain_file() and
    SSL_CTX_use_PrivateKey_file() errors individually.
  * Fix a race condition when canceling ADB find which could cause
    an assertion failure.
  * SERVFAIL cache memory cleaning is now more aggressive; it no
    longer consumes a lot of memory if the server encounters many
    SERVFAILs at once.
  * Fix trying the next primary XoT server when the previous one
    was marked as unreachable.
  * In some cases named failed to try the next primary server in
    the primaries list when the previous one was marked as
    unreachable. This has been fixed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 21 08:42:47 UTC 2024 - Jorik Cronenberg <jorik.cronenberg@suse.com>

- Update to release 9.20.3
  New Features:
  * Log query response status to the query log.
  * Log a query response summary using the new responses category.
    Logging can be controlled via the responselog option and via
    rndc responselog.
  * Added WALLET type.
  * Add the new record type WALLET (262). This provides a mapping
    from a domain name to a cryptographic currency wallet. Multiple
    mappings can exist if multiple records exist.

  Feature Changes:
  * Set logging category for notify/xfer-in-related messages.
  * Some notify and xfer-in-related log messages were logged at the
    “general” category level instead of their own category. This
    has been fixed.
  * Allow IXFR-to-AXFR fallback on DNS_R_TOOMANYRECORDS.
  * This change allows fallback from an IXFR failure to AXFR when
    the reason is DNS_R_TOOMANYRECORDS.

  Bug Fixes:
  * Fix a statistics channel counter bug when “forward only” zones
    are used.
  * When resolving a zone with a “forward only” policy, and finding
    out that all the forwarders were marked as “bad”, the
    “ServerQuota” counter of the statistics channel was incorrectly
    increased. This has been fixed.
  * Fix a bug in the static-stub implementation.
  * Static-stub addresses and addresses from other sources were
    being mixed together, resulting in static-stub queries going to
    addresses not specified in the configuration, or alternatively,
    static-stub addresses being used instead of the correct server
    addresses.
  * Don’t allow statistics-channels if libxml2 and libjson-c are
    not configured.
  * When BIND 9 is not configured with the libxml2 and libjson-c
    libraries, the use of the statistics-channels option is a fatal
    error.
  * Separate DNSSEC validation from long-running tasks.
  * Split CPU-intensive and long-running tasks into separate
    threadpools in a way that the long-running tasks - like RPZ,
    catalog zone processing, or zone file operations - don’t block
    CPU-intensive operations like DNSSEC validations.
  * Fix an assertion failure when processing access control lists.
  * The named process could terminate unexpectedly when processing
    ACLs. This has been fixed.
  * Fix a bug in Offline KSK using a ZSK with an unlimited
    lifetime.
  * If the ZSK had an unlimited lifetime, the timing metadata
    Inactive and Delete could not be found and were treated as an
    error, preventing the zone from being signed. This has been
    fixed.
  * Limit the outgoing UDP send queue size.
  * If the operating system UDP queue got full and the outgoing UDP
    sending started to be delayed, BIND 9 could exhibit memory
    spikes as it tried to enqueue all the outgoing UDP messages. It
    now tries to deliver the outgoing UDP messages synchronously;
    if that fails, it drops the outgoing DNS message that would get
    queued up and then timeout on the client side.
  * Do not set SO_INCOMING_CPU.
  * Remove the SO_INCOMING_CPU setting as kernel scheduling
    performs better without constraints.
  * Fix the rndc dumpdb command’s error reporting.
  * The rndc dumpdb command was not reporting errors that occurred
    when named started up the database dump process. This has been
    fixed.
  * Fix long-running incoming transfers.
  * Incoming transfers that took longer than 30 seconds would stop
    reading from the TCP stream and the incoming transfer would be
    indefinitely stuck, causing BIND 9 to hang during shutdown.
  * This has been fixed, and the max-transfer-time-in and
    max-transfer-idle-in timeouts are now honored.
  * Fix an assertion failure when receiving DNS responses over TCP.
  * When matching the received Query ID in the TCP connection, an
    invalid Query ID could cause an assertion failure. This has
    been fixed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 19 08:57:57 UTC 2024 - Jorik Cronenberg <jorik.cronenberg@suse.com>

- Update to release 9.20.2
  New Features:
  * Support for Offline KSK implemented.
  * Add a new configuration option offline-ksk to enable Offline
    KSK key management. Signed Key Response (SKR) files created
    with dnssec-ksr (or other programs) can now be imported into
    named with the new rndc skr -import command. Rather than
    creating new DNSKEY, CDS, and CDNSKEY records and generating
    signatures covering these types, these records are loaded from
    the currently active bundle from the imported SKR.
  * The implementation is loosely based on
    draft-icann-dnssec-keymgmt-01.txt.
  * Print the full path of the working directory in startup log
    messages.
  * named now prints its initial working directory during startup,
    and the changed working directory when loading or reloading its
    configuration file, if it has a valid directory option defined.
  * Support a restricted key tag range when generating new keys.
  * When multiple signers are being used to sign a zone, it is
    useful to be able to specify a restricted range of key tags to
    be used by an operator to sign the zone. The range can be
    specified with tag-range in dnssec-policy’s keys (for named and
    dnssec-ksr) and with the new options dnssec-keyfromlabel -M and
    dnssec-keygen -M.

  Feature Changes:
  * Exempt prefetches from the fetches-per-zone and
    fetches-per-server quotas.
  * Fetches generated automatically as a result of prefetch are now
    exempt from the fetches-per-zone and fetches-per-server quotas.
    This should help in maintaining the cache from which query
    responses can be given.
  * Follow the number of CPUs set by taskset/cpuset.
  * Administrators may wish to constrain the set of cores that
    named runs on via the taskset, cpuset, or numactl programs (or
    equivalents on other OSes).
  * If the admin has used taskset, named now automatically uses the
    given number of CPUs rather than the system-wide count.

  Bug Fixes:
  * Delay the release of root privileges until after configuring
    controls.
  * Delay relinquishing root privileges until the control channel
    has been configured, for the benefit of systems that require
    root to use privileged port numbers. This mostly affects
    systems without fine- grained privilege systems (i.e., other
    than Linux).
  * Fix a rare assertion failure when shutting down incoming
    transfer.
  * A very rare assertion failure could be triggered when the
    incoming transfer was either forcefully shut down, or it
    finished during the printing of the details about the
    statistics channel. This has been fixed.
  * Fix algorithm rollover bug when there are two keys with the
    same keytag.
  * If there was an algorithm rollover and two keys of different
    algorithms shared the same keytags, there was the possibility
    that the check of whether the key matched a specific state
    could be performed against the wrong key. This has been fixed
    by not only checking for the matching key tag but also the key
    algorithm.
  * Fix an assertion failure in validate_dnskey_dsset_done().
  * Under rare circumstances, named could terminate unexpectedly
    when validating a DNSKEY resource record if the validation had
    been canceled in the meantime. This has been fixed.

  Known Issues:
  * Long-running tasks in offloaded threads (e.g. the loading of
    RPZ zones or processing zone transfers) may block the
    resolution of queries during these operations and cause the
    queries to time out. To work around the issue, the
    UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE environment variable can be set to a larger
    value before starting named. The recommended value is the
    number of RPZ zones (or number of transfers) plus the number of
    threads BIND should use, which is typically the number of CPUs.


-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug 23 09:26:22 UTC 2024 - Jorik Cronenberg <jorik.cronenberg@suse.com>

- Update to release 9.20.1
  New Features:
  * Implement rndc retransfer -force.
  * A new optional argument -force has been added to the command
    rndc retransfer. When it is specified, named aborts the ongoing
    zone transfer (if there is one) and starts a new transfer.
  * dig now reports a missing QUESTION section for messages with
    opcode QUERY.
  * Query responses should contain the QUESTION section, with some
    exceptions. dig was not reporting this.

  Feature Changes:
  * Tighten max-recursion-queries and add max-query-restarts
    configuration statement.
  * There were cases when the max-recursion-queries quota was
    ineffective. It was possible to craft zones that would cause a
    resolver to waste resources by sending excessive queries while
    attempting to resolve a name. This has been addressed by
    correcting errors in the implementation of
    max-recursion-queries and by reducing the default value from
    100 to 32.
  * In addition, a new max-query-restarts configuration statement
    has been added, which limits the number of times a recursive
    server will follow CNAME or DNAME records before terminating
    resolution. This was previously a hard-coded limit of 16 but is
    now configurable with a default value of 11.
  * ISC would like to thank Huayi Duan, Marco Bearzi, Jodok Vieli,
    and Cagin Tanir from NetSec group, ETH Zurich for discovering
    and notifying us about the issue.
  * Allow shorter resolver-query-timeout configuration.
  * The minimum allowed value of resolver-query-timeout was lowered
    from its previous value of 10 000 milliseconds (which is still
    the default) to 301 milliseconds. Note however that values of 1
    to 300 inclusive are interpreted as seconds before applying the
    limit. A value of zero is interpreted as the default.
  * Raise the log level of priming failures.
  * When a priming query is complete, it was previously logged at
    level DEBUG(1), regardless of success or failure. It is now
    logged to NOTICE in the case of failure.

  Bug Fixes:
  * Fix a crash caused by valid TSIG signatures with invalid time.
  * An assertion failure was triggered when the TSIG had a valid
    cryptographic signature but the time was invalid. This could
    happen when the times between the primary and secondary servers
    were not synchronised. The crash has now been fixed.
  * Return SERVFAIL for a too long CNAME chain.
  * When following long CNAME chains, named was returning NOERROR
    (along with a partial answer) instead of SERVFAIL, if the chain
    exceeded the maximum length. This has been fixed.
  * Reconfigure catz member zones during named reconfiguration.
  * During a reconfiguration, named wasn’t reconfiguring catalog
    zones’ member zones. This has been fixed.
  * Update key lifetime and metadata after dnssec-policy
    reconfiguration.
  * Adjust key state and timing metadata if dnssec-policy key
    lifetime configuration is updated, so that it also affects
    existing keys.
  * Fix a crash during zone modification.
  * Fix an assertion failure that could happen when an
    authoritative zone was modified while the server was generating
    an answer from that zone.
  * Fix assertion failure when executing named-checkconf -v to
    print its version.
  * Fix generation of 6to4-self name expansion from IPv4 address.
  * The period between the most significant nibble of the encoded
    IPv4 address and the 2.0.0.2.IP6.ARPA suffix was missing,
    resulting in the wrong name being checked. This has been fixed.
  * dig +yaml was producing unexpected and/or invalid YAML. output.
  * SVBC ALPN text parsing failed to reject zero-length ALPN.
  * Fix false QNAME minimisation error being reported.
  * Remove the false positive success resolving log message when
    QNAME minimisation is in effect and the final result is an
    NXDOMAIN.
  * Fix --enable-tracing build on systems without dtrace.
  * A missing util/dtrace.sh file prevented builds on systems
    without the dtrace utility. This has been corrected.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul 24 09:03:08 UTC 2024 - Jorik Cronenberg <jorik.cronenberg@suse.com>

- Update to new major version 9.20.0
  For a complete list of all changes see:
  * https://bind9.readthedocs.io/en/v9.20.0/notes.html
  * The CHANGES file in the source RPM

  Some noteworthy changes:
  * Added new BuildRequires liburcu for lock free data structures.
  * A new DNSSEC tool dnssec-ksr has been added to create Key
    Signing Request (KSR) and Signed Key Response (SKR) files.
  * /etc/bind.keys and /var/lib/named/named.root.key have been
    removed as the correct defaults are pre-compiled and there is
    no need to configure bind.keys manually.
  * The functions that were in the libbind9 shared library have
    been moved to the libisc and libisccfg libraries. The now-empty
    libbind9 has been removed and is no longer installed.
  * The irs_resconf module has been moved to the libdns shared
    library. The now-empty libirs library has been removed and is
    no longer installed.

  Security Fixes:
  * A malicious DNS client that sent many queries over TCP but
    never read the responses could cause a server to respond slowly
    or not at all for other clients. This has been fixed.
    (CVE-2024-0760)
    [bsc#1228255]
  * It is possible to craft excessively large resource records
    sets, which have the effect of slowing down database
    processing. This has been addressed by adding a configurable
    limit to the number of records that can be stored per name and
    type in a cache or zone database. The default is 100, which can
    be tuned with the new max-records-per-type option.
  * It is possible to craft excessively large numbers of resource
    record types for a given owner name, which has the effect of
    slowing down database processing. This has been addressed by
    adding a configurable limit to the number of records that can
    be stored per name and type in a cache or zone database. The
    default is 100, which can be tuned with the new
    max-types-per-name option. (CVE-2024-1737)
    [bsc#1228256]
  * Validating DNS messages signed using the SIG(0) protocol (RFC
    2931) could cause excessive CPU load, leading to a
    denial-of-service condition. Support for SIG(0) message
    validation was removed from this version of named.
    (CVE-2024-1975)
    [bsc#1228257]
  * Due to a logic error, lookups that triggered serving stale data
    and required lookups in local authoritative zone data could
    have resulted in an assertion failure. This has been fixed.
  * Potential data races were found in our DoH implementation,
    related to HTTP/2 session object management and endpoints set
    object management after reconfiguration. These issues have been
    fixed.
  * When looking up the NS records of parent zones as part of
    looking up DS records, it was possible for named to trigger an
    assertion failure if serve-stale was enabled. This has been
    fixed. (CVE-2024-4076)

Fri May 17 16:05:37 UTC 2024 - Jorik Cronenberg <jorik.cronenberg@suse.com>

- Update to release 9.18.27
  New Features:
  * A new option signatures-jitter has been added to dnssec-policy
    to allow signature expirations to be spread out over a period
    of time.

  Feature Changes:
  * DNSSEC signatures that are not valid because the current time
    falls outside the signature inception and expiration dates are
    skipped instead of causing an immediate validation failure.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Apr 21 21:17:19 UTC 2024 - Jorik Cronenberg <jorik.cronenberg@suse.com>

- Update to release 9.18.26
  New Features:
  * The statistics channel now includes counters that indicate the
    number of currently connected TCP IPv4/IPv6 clients.
  * Added RESOLVER.ARPA to the built in empty zones.

  Bug Fixes:
  * Changes to listen-on statements were ignored on reconfiguration
    unless the port or interface address was changed, making it
    impossible to change a related listener transport type. That
    issue has been fixed.
  * A bug in the keymgr code unintentionally slowed down some
    DNSSEC key rollovers. This has been fixed.
  * Some ISO 8601 durations were accepted erroneously, leading to
    shorter durations than expected. This has been fixed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 20 13:39:16 UTC 2024 - Jorik Cronenberg <jorik.cronenberg@suse.com>

- Update to release 9.18.25
  Bug Fixes:
  * A regression in cache-cleaning code enabled memory use to grow
    significantly more quickly than before, until the configured
    max-cache-size limit was reached. This has been fixed.
  * Using rndc flush inadvertently caused cache cleaning to become
    less effective. This could ultimately lead to the configured
    max-cache-size limit being exceeded and has now been fixed.
  * The logic for cleaning up expired cached DNS records was
    tweaked to be more aggressive. This change helps with enforcing
    max-cache-ttl and max-ncache-ttl in a timely manner. [GL #4591]
  * It was possible to trigger a use-after-free assertion when the
    overmem cache cleaning was initiated. This has been fixed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb 13 15:15:21 UTC 2024 - Jorik Cronenberg <jorik.cronenberg@suse.com>

- Update to release 9.18.24
  Security Fixes:
  * Validating DNS messages containing a lot of DNSSEC signatures
    could cause excessive CPU load, leading to a denial-of-service
    condition. This has been fixed. (CVE-2023-50387)
    [bsc#1219823]
  * Preparing an NSEC3 closest encloser proof could cause excessiv
    CPU load, leading to a denial-of-service condition. This has
    been fixed. (CVE-2023-50868)
    [bsc#1219826]
  * Parsing DNS messages with many different names could cause
    excessive CPU load. This has been fixed. (CVE-2023-4408)
    [bsc#1219851]
  * Specific queries could cause named to crash with an assertion
    failure when nxdomain-redirect was enabled. This has been
    fixed. (CVE-2023-5517)
    [bsc#1219852]
  * A bad interaction between DNS64 and serve-stale could cause
    named to crash with an assertion failure, when both of these
    features were enabled. This has been fixed. (CVE-2023-5679)
    [bsc#1219853]
  * Query patterns that continuously triggered cache database
    maintenance could cause an excessive amount of memory to be
    allocated, exceeding max-cache-size and potentially leading to
    all available memory on the host running named being exhausted
    This has been fixed. (CVE-2023-6516)
    [bsc#1219854]
  * Under certain circumstances, the DNS-over-TLS client code
    incorrectly attempted to process more than one DNS message at a
    time, which could cause named to crash with an assertion
    failure. This has been fixed.

  Bug Fixes:
  * The counters exported via the statistics channel were changed
    back to 64-bit signed values; they were being inadvertently
    truncated to unsigned 32-bit values since BIND 9.15.0.

- Update to release 9.18.21
  Removed Features:
  * Support for using AES as the DNS COOKIE algorithm
    (cookie-algorithm aes;) has been deprecated and will be removed
    in a future release. Please use the current default,
    SipHash-2-4, instead.
  * The resolver-nonbackoff-tries and resolver-retry-interval
    statements have been deprecated. Using them now causes a
    warning to be logged.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov 15 16:16:29 UTC 2023 - Jorik Cronenberg <jorik.cronenberg@suse.com>

- Update to release 9.18.20
  Feature Changes:
  * The IP addresses for B.ROOT-SERVERS.NET have been updated to
    170.247.170.2 and 2801:1b8:10::b.

  Bug Fixes:
  * If the unsigned version of an inline-signed zone contained
    DNSSEC records, it was incorrectly scheduled for resigning.
    This has been fixed.
  * Looking up stale data from the cache did not take local
    authoritative data into account. This has been fixed. 
  * An assertion failure was triggered when lock-file was used at
    the same time as the named -X command-line option. This has
    been fixed.
  * The lock-file file was being removed when it should not have
    been, making the statement ineffective when named was started
    three or more times. This has been fixed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep 19 13:28:53 UTC 2023 - Jorik Cronenberg <jorik.cronenberg@suse.com>

- Update to release 9.18.19
  Security Fixes:
  * Previously, sending a specially crafted message over the
    control channel could cause the packet-parsing code to run out
    of available stack memory, causing named to terminate
    unexpectedly. This has been fixed. (CVE-2023-3341)
    [bsc#1215472]
  * A flaw in the networking code handling DNS-over-TLS queries
    could cause named to terminate unexpectedly due to an assertion
    failure under significant DNS-over-TLS query load. This has
    been fixed. (CVE-2023-4236)
    [bsc#1215471]

  Removed Features:
  * The dnssec-must-be-secure option has been deprecated and will
    be removed in a future release.

  Feature Changes:
  * If the server command is specified, nsupdate now honors the
    nsupdate -v option for SOA queries by sending both the UPDATE
    request and the initial query over TCP.

  Bug Fixes:
  * The value of the If-Modified-Since header in the statistics
    channel was not being correctly validated for its length,
    potentially allowing an authorized user to trigger a buffer
    overflow. Ensuring the statistics channel is configured
    correctly to grant access exclusively to authorized users is
    essential (see the statistics-channels block definition and
    usage section).
  * The Content-Length header in the statistics channel was lacking
    proper bounds checking. A negative or excessively large value
    could potentially trigger an integer overflow and result in an
    assertion failure.
  * Several memory leaks caused by not clearing the OpenSSL error
    stack were fixed.
  * The introduction of krb5-subdomain-self-rhs and
    ms-subdomain-self-rhs UPDATE policies accidentally caused named
    to return SERVFAIL responses to deletion requests for
    non-existent PTR and SRV records. This has been fixed.
  * The stale-refresh-time feature was mistakenly disabled when the
    server cache was flushed by rndc flush. This has been fixed.
  * BIND’s memory consumption has been improved by implementing
    dedicated jemalloc memory arenas for sending buffers. This
    optimization ensures that memory usage is more efficient and
    better manages the return of memory pages to the operating
    system.
  * Previously, partial writes in the TLS DNS code were not
    accounted for correctly, which could have led to DNS message
    corruption. This has been fixed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug 16 13:44:22 UTC 2023 - Jorik Cronenberg <jorik.cronenberg@suse.com>

- Update to release 9.18.18
  Feature Changes:
  * When a primary server for a zone responds to an SOA query, but
    the subsequent TCP connection required to transfer the zone is
    refused, that server is marked as temporarily unreachable. This
    now also happens if the TCP connection attempt times out,
    preventing too many zones from queuing up on an unreachable
    server and allowing the refresh process to move on to the next
    configured primary more quickly.
  * The dialup and heartbeat-interval options have been deprecated
    and will be removed in a future BIND 9 release.

  Bug Fixes:
  * Processing already-queued queries received over TCP could cause
    an assertion failure, when the server was reconfigured at the
    same time or the cache was being flushed. This has been fixed.
  * Setting dnssec-policy to insecure prevented zones containing
    resource records with a TTL value larger than 86400 seconds (1
    day) from being loaded. This has been fixed by ignoring the TTL
    values in the zone and using a value of 604800 seconds (1 week)
    as the maximum zone TTL in key rollover timing calculations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul 19 10:34:30 UTC 2023 - Jorik Cronenberg <jorik.cronenberg@suse.com>

- Update to release 9.18.17
  Feature Changes:
  * If a response from an authoritative server has its RCODE set to
    FORMERR and contains an echoed EDNS COOKIE option that was
    present in the query, named now retries sending the query to
    the same server without an EDNS COOKIE option.
  * The relaxed QNAME minimization mode now uses NS records. This
    reduces the number of queries named makes when resolving, as it
    allows the non-existence of NS RRsets at non-referral nodes to
    be cached in addition to the normally cached referrals.

  Bug Fixes:
  * The ability to read HMAC-MD5 key files, which was accidentally
    lost in BIND 9.18.8, has been restored.
  * Several minor stability issues with the catalog zone
    implementation have been fixed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun 22 08:04:23 UTC 2023 - Jorik Cronenberg <jorik.cronenberg@suse.com>

- Update to release 9.18.16
  Security Fixes:
  * The overmem cleaning process has been improved, to prevent the
    cache from significantly exceeding the configured
    max-cache-size limit. (CVE-2023-2828)
  * A query that prioritizes stale data over lookup triggers a
    fetch to refresh the stale data in cache. If the fetch is
    aborted for exceeding the recursion quota, it was possible for
    named to enter an infinite callback loop and crash due to stack
    overflow. This has been fixed. (CVE-2023-2911)

  New Features:
  * The system test suite can now be executed with pytest (along
    with pytest-xdist for parallel execution).

  Removed Features:
  * TKEY mode 2 (Diffie-Hellman Exchanged Keying) is now
    deprecated, and will be removed in a future release. A warning
    will be logged when the tkey-dhkey option is used in
    named.conf.

  Bug Fixes:
  * BIND could get stuck on reconfiguration when a listen-on
    statement for HTTP is removed from the configuration. That has
    been fixed.
  * Previously, it was possible for a delegation from cache to be
    returned to the client after the stale-answer-client-timeout
    duration. This has been fixed.
  * BIND could allocate too big buffers when sending data via
    stream-based DNS transports, leading to increased memory usage.
    This has been fixed.
  * When the stale-answer-enable option was enabled and the
    stale-answer-client-timeout option was enabled and larger than
    0, named previously allocated two slots from the
    clients-per-query limit for each client and failed to gradually
    auto-tune its value, as configured. This has been fixed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 17 09:39:55 UTC 2023 - Jorik Cronenberg <jorik.cronenberg@suse.com>

- Update to release 9.18.15
  Bug Fixes:
  * The max-transfer-time-in and max-transfer-idle-in statements
    have not had any effect since the BIND 9 networking stack was
    refactored in version 9.16. The missing functionality has been
    re-implemented and incoming zone transfers now time out
    properly when not progressing.
  * The read timeout in rndc is now 60 seconds, matching the
    behavior in BIND 9.16 and earlier. It had previously been
    lowered to 30 seconds by mistake.
  * When the ISC_R_INVALIDPROTO (ENOPROTOOPT, EPROTONOSUPPORT)
    error code is returned by libuv, it is now treated as a network
    failure: the server for which that error code is returned gets
    marked as broken and is not contacted again during a given
    resolution process.
  * When removing delegations from an opt-out range,
    empty-non-terminal NSEC3 records generated by those delegations
    were not cleaned up. This has been fixed.
  * Log file rotation code did not clean up older versions of log
    files when the logging channel had an absolute path configured
    as a file destination. This has been fixed.

  Known Issues:
  * Sending NOTIFY messages silently fails when the source port
    specified in the notify-source statement is already in use.
    This can happen e.g. when multiple servers are configured as
    NOTIFY targets for a zone and some of them are unresponsive.
    This issue can be worked around by not specifying the source
    port for NOTIFY messages in the notify-source statement; note
    that source port configuration is already deprecated and will
    be removed altogether in a future release.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr 21 13:08:03 UTC 2023 - Jorik Cronenberg <jorik.cronenberg@suse.com>

- Update to release 9.18.14
  Removed Features:
  * Zone type delegation-only, and the delegation-only and
    root-delegation-only statements, have been deprecated. A
    warning is now logged when they are used.
  * These statements were created to address the SiteFinder
    controversy, in which certain top-level domains redirected
    misspelled queries to other sites instead of returning NXDOMAIN
    responses. Since top-level domains are now DNSSEC-signed, and
    DNSSEC validation is active by default, the statements are no
    longer needed.

  Bug Fixes:
  * Several bugs which could cause named to crash during catalog
    zone processing have been fixed.
  * Previously, downloading large zones over TLS (XoT) from a
    primary could hang the transfer on the secondary, especially
    when the connection was unstable. This has been fixed.
  * Performance of DNSSEC validation in zones with many DNSKEY
    records has been improved.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 15 16:13:44 UTC 2023 - Jorik Cronenberg <jorik.cronenberg@suse.com>

- Update to release 9.18.13
  New Features:
  * RPZ updates are now run on specialized “offload” threads to
    reduce the amount of time they block query processing on the
    main networking threads. This increases the responsiveness of
    named when RPZ updates are being applied after an RPZ zone has
    been successfully transferred.

  Feature Changes:
  * Catalog zone updates are now run on specialized “offload”
    threads to reduce the amount of time they block query
    processing on the main networking threads. This increases the
    responsiveness of named when catalog zone updates are being
    applied after a catalog zone has been successfully transferred.
  * libuv support for receiving multiple UDP messages in a single
    recvmmsg() system call has been tweaked several times between
    libuv versions 1.35.0 and 1.40.0; the current recommended libuv
    version is 1.40.0 or higher. New rules are now in effect for
    running with a different version of libuv than the one used at
    compilation time. These rules may trigger a fatal error at
    startup:
    - Building against or running with libuv versions 1.35.0 and
      1.36.0 is now a fatal error.
    - Running with libuv version higher than 1.34.2 is now a
      fatal error when named is built against libuv version
      1.34.2 or lower.
    - Running with libuv version higher than 1.39.0 is now a
      fatal error when named is built against libuv version
      1.37.0, 1.38.0, 1.38.1, or 1.39.0.
  * This prevents the use of libuv versions that may trigger an
    assertion failure when receiving multiple UDP messages in a
    single system call.

  Bug Fixes:
  * named could crash with an assertion failure when adding a new
    zone into the configuration file for a name which was already
    configured as a member zone for a catalog zone. This has been
    fixed.
  * When named starts up, it sends a query for the DNSSEC key for
    each configured trust anchor to determine whether the key has
    changed. In some unusual cases, the query might depend on a
    zone for which the server is itself authoritative, and would
    have failed if it were sent before the zone was fully loaded.
    This has now been fixed by delaying the key queries until all
    zones have finished loading.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb 16 14:36:14 UTC 2023 - Jorik Cronenberg <jorik.cronenberg@suse.com>

- Update to release 9.18.12
  Removed Features:
  * Specifying a port when configuring source addresses (i.e., as
    an argument to query-source, query-source-v6, transfer-source,
    transfer-source-v6, notify-source, notify-source-v6,
    parental-source, or parental-source-v6, or in the source or
    source-v6 arguments to primaries, parental-agents, also-notify,
    or catalog-zones) has been deprecated. In addition, the
    use-v4-udp-ports, use-v6-udp-ports, avoid-v4-udp-ports, and
    avoid-v6-udp-ports options have also been deprecated.
    Warnings are now logged when any of these options are
    encountered in named.conf. In a future release, they will be
    made nonfunctional.

  Bug Fixes:
  * A constant stream of zone additions and deletions via rndc
    reconfig could cause increased memory consumption due to
    delayed cleaning of view memory. This has been fixed. 
  * The speed of the message digest algorithms (MD5, SHA-1, SHA-2),
    and of NSEC3 hashing, has been improved.
  * Pointing parental-agents to a resolver did not work because the
    RD bit was not set on DS requests. This has been fixed. 
  * Building BIND 9 failed when the --enable-dnsrps switch for
    ./configure was used. This has been fixed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan 24 13:39:10 UTC 2023 - Jorik Cronenberg <jorik.cronenberg@suse.com>

- Update to release 9.18.11
  Security Fixes:
  * An UPDATE message flood could cause named to exhaust all
    available memory. This flaw was addressed by adding a new
    update-quota option that controls the maximum number of
    outstanding DNS UPDATE messages that named can hold in a queue
    at any given time (default: 100). (CVE-2022-3094)
  * named could crash with an assertion failure when an RRSIG query
    was received and stale-answer-client-timeout was set to a
    non-zero value. This has been fixed. (CVE-2022-3736)
  * named running as a resolver with the
    stale-answer-client-timeout option set to any value greater
    than 0 could crash with an assertion failure, when the
    recursive-clients soft quota was reached. This has been fixed.
    (CVE-2022-3924)

  New Features:
  * The new update-quota option can be used to control the number
    of simultaneous DNS UPDATE messages that can be processed to
    update an authoritative zone on a primary server, or forwarded
    to the primary server by a secondary server. The default is
    100. A new statistics counter has also been added to record
    events when this quota is exceeded, and the version numbers for
    the XML and JSON statistics schemas have been updated.

  Removed Features:
  * The Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) feature in BIND
    has been non-operational since the new Network Manager was
    introduced in BIND 9.16. It is now marked as obsolete, and
    vestigial code implementing it has been removed. Configuring
    DSCP values in named.conf now causes a warning to be logged.

  Feature Changes:
  * The catalog zone implementation has been optimized to work with
    hundreds of thousands of member zones.

  Bug Fixes:
  * A rare assertion failure was fixed in outgoing TCP DNS
    connection handling.
  * Large zone transfers over TLS (XoT) could fail. This has been
    fixed.
  * In addition to a previously fixed bug, another similar issue
    was discovered where quotas could be erroneously reached for
    servers, including any configured forwarders, resulting in
    SERVFAIL answers being sent to clients. This has been fixed.
  * In certain query resolution scenarios (e.g. when following
    CNAME records), named configured to answer from stale cache
    could return a SERVFAIL response despite a usable, non-stale
    answer being present in the cache. This has been fixed.
  * When an outgoing request timed out, named would retry up to
    three times with the same server instead of trying the next
    available name server. This has been fixed.
  * Recently used ADB names and ADB entries (IP addresses) could
    get cleaned when ADB was under memory pressure. To mitigate
    this, only actual ADB names and ADB entries are now counted
    (excluding internal memory structures used for “housekeeping”)
    and recently used (<= 10 seconds) ADB names and entries are
    excluded from the overmem memory cleaner.
  * The “Prohibited” Extended DNS Error was inadvertently set in
    some NOERROR responses. This has been fixed.
  * Previously, TLS session resumption could have led to handshake
    failures when client certificates were used for authentication
    (Mutual TLS). This has been fixed.

Thu Dec 22 12:36:53 UTC 2022 - Jorik Cronenberg <jorik.cronenberg@suse.com>

- Update to release 9.18.10
  Feature Changes:
  * To reduce unnecessary memory consumption in the cache, NXDOMAIN
    records are no longer retained past the normal negative cache
    TTL, even if stale-cache-enable is set to yes.
  * The auto-dnssec option has been deprecated and will be removed
    in a future BIND 9.19.x release. Please migrate to
    dnssec-policy.
  * The coresize, datasize, files, and stacksize options have been
    deprecated. The limits these options set should be enforced
    externally, either by manual configuration (e.g. using ulimit)
    or via the process supervisor (e.g. systemd).
  * Setting alternate local addresses for inbound zone transfers
    has been deprecated. The relevant options (alt-transfer-source,
    alt-transfer-source-v6, and use-alt-transfer-source) will be
    removed in a future BIND 9.19.x release.
  * The number of HTTP headers allowed in requests sent to named’s
    statistics channel has been increased from 10 to 100, to
    accommodate some browsers that send more than 10 headers by
    default.

  Bug Fixes:
  * named could crash due to an assertion failure when an HTTP
    connection to the statistics channel was closed prematurely
    (due to a connection error, shutdown, etc.).
  * When a catalog zone was removed from the configuration, in some
    cases a dangling pointer could cause the named process to
    crash.
  * When a zone was deleted from a server, a key management object
    related to that zone was inadvertently kept in memory and only
    released upon shutdown. This could lead to constantly
    increasing memory use on servers with a high rate of changes
    affecting the set of zones being served.
  * TLS configuration for primary servers was not applied for zones
    that were members of a catalog zone.
  * In certain cases, named waited for the resolution of
    outstanding recursive queries to finish before shutting down.
  * host and nslookup command-line options setting the custom
    TCP/UDP port to use were ignored for ANY queries (which are
    sent over TCP).
  * The zone <name>/<class>: final reference detached log message
    was moved from the INFO log level to the DEBUG(1) log level to
    prevent the named-checkzone tool from superfluously logging
    this message in non-debug mode.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov 21 15:03:35 UTC 2022 - Jorik Cronenberg <jorik.cronenberg@suse.com>

- Update to bind release 9.18.9
  Bug Fixes:
  * A crash was fixed that happened when a dnssec-policy zone that
    used NSEC3 was reconfigured to enable inline-signing.
  * In certain resolution scenarios, quotas could be erroneously
    reached for servers, including any configured forwarders,
    resulting in SERVFAIL answers being sent to clients.
  * rpz-ip rules in response-policy zones could be ineffective in
    some cases if a query had the CD (Checking Disabled) bit set to
    1.
  * Previously, if Internet connectivity issues were experienced
    during the initial startup of named, a BIND resolver with
    dnssec-validation set to auto could enter into a state where it
    would not recover without stopping named, manually deleting the
    managed-keys.bind and managed-keys.bind.jnl files, and starting
    named again.
  * The statistics counter representing the current number of
    clients awaiting recursive resolution results (RecursClients)
    could overflow in certain resolution scenarios.
  * Previously, the port in remote servers such as in primaries and
    parental-agents could be wrongly configured because of an
    inheritance bug.
  * Previously, BIND failed to start on Solaris-based systems with
    hundreds of CPUs.
  * When a DNS resource record’s TTL value was equal to the
    resolver’s configured prefetch “eligibility” value, the record
    was erroneously not treated as eligible for prefetching.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov  7 14:17:22 UTC 2022 - Jorik Cronenberg <jorik.cronenberg@suse.com>

- Update to bind release 9.18.8
  New Features:
  * Support for parsing and validating the dohpath service
    parameter in SVCB records was added.
  * named now logs the supported cryptographic algorithms during
    startup and in the output of named -V.
  * The recursion not available and query (cache) '...' denied log
    messages were extended to include the name of the ACL that
    caused a given query to be denied.

  Bug Fixes:
  * An assertion failure was fixed in named that was caused by
    aborting the statistics channel connection while sending
    statistics data to the client.
  * Changing just the TSIG key names for primaries in catalog
    zones’ member zones was not effective. This has been fixed.

  Known Issues:
  * Upgrading from BIND 9.16.32, 9.18.6, or any older version may
    require a manual configuration change. The following
    configurations are affected:
    - type primary zones configured with dnssec-policy but without
      either allow-update or update-policy,
    - type secondary zones configured with dnssec-policy.
    In these cases please add inline-signing yes; to the individual
    zone configuration(s). Without applying this change, named will
    fail to start. For more details, see
    https://kb.isc.org/docs/dnssec-policy-requires-dynamic-dns-or-inline-signing
  * BIND 9.18 does not support dynamic update forwarding (see
    allow-update-forwarding) in conjuction with zone transfers over
    TLS (XoT).

Wed Sep 21 11:49:07 UTC 2022 - Jorik Cronenberg <jorik.cronenberg@suse.com>

- Update to bind release 9.18.7
  Security Fixes:
  * Previously, there was no limit to the number of database lookups
    performed while processing large delegations, which could be
    abused to severely impact the performance of named running as a
    recursive resolver. This has been fixed. (CVE-2022-2795)
  * When an HTTP connection was reused to request statistics from the
    stats channel, the content length of successive responses could
    grow in size past the end of the allocated buffer.
    This has been fixed. (CVE-2022-2881)
  * Memory leaks in code handling Diffie-Hellman (DH) keys were fixed
    that could be externally triggered, when using TKEY records in DH
    mode with OpenSSL 3.0.0 and later versions. (CVE-2022-2906)
  * named running as a resolver with the stale-answer-client-timeout
    option set to 0 could crash with an assertion failure, when there
    was a stale CNAME in the cache for the incoming query.
    This has been fixed. (CVE-2022-3080)
  * Memory leaks were fixed that could be externally triggered in the
    DNSSEC verification code for the EdDSA algorithm. (CVE-2022-38178)

  Feature Changes:
  * Response Rate Limiting (RRL) code now treats all QNAMEs that are
    subject to wildcard processing within a given zone as the same
    name, to prevent circumventing the limits enforced by RRL.
  * Zones using dnssec-policy now require dynamic DNS or
    inline-signing to be configured explicitly.
  * When reconfiguring dnssec-policy from using NSEC with an NSEC-only
    DNSKEY algorithm (e.g. RSASHA1) to a policy that uses NSEC3,
    BIND 9 no longer fails to sign the zone; instead, it keeps using
    NSEC until the offending DNSKEY records have been removed from the
    zone, then switches to using NSEC3.
  * A backward-compatible approach was implemented for encoding
    internationalized domain names (IDN) in dig and converting the
    domain to IDNA2008 form; if that fails, BIND tries an IDNA2003
    conversion.

  Bug Fixes:
  * A serve-stale bug was fixed, where BIND would try to return stale
    data from cache for lookups that received duplicate queries or
    queries that would be dropped. This bug resulted in premature
    SERVFAIL responses, and has now been resolved.

  This obsoletes the following patch:

- Update to bind release 9.18.6
  Bug Fixes:
  * When running as a validating resolver forwarding all queries
    to another resolver, named could crash with an assertion failure.
    These crashes occurred when the configured forwarder sent
    a broken DS response and named failed its attempts to find
    a proper one instead. This has been fixed.
  * Non-dynamic zones that inherit dnssec-policy from the view
    or options blocks were not marked as inline-signed
    and therefore never scheduled to be re-signed. This has been fixed.
  * The old max-zone-ttl zone option was meant to be superseded
    by the max-zone-ttl option in dnssec-policy; however,
    the latter option was not fully effective. This has been corrected:
    zones no longer load if they contain TTLs greater than the limit
    configured in dnssec-policy. For zones with both the old
    max-zone-ttl option and dnssec-policy configured,
    the old option is ignored, and a warning is generated.
  * rndc dumpdb -expired was fixed to include expired RRsets,
    even if stale-cache-enable is set to no and the cache-cleaning
    time window has passed.

- When enabling query_logging by un-commenting an example in
  bind.conf, named attempts to create a file in /var/log which
  fails due to missing credentials. This also applies to the
  "dump-file" and the "statistics-file".
  This is solved by having systemd-tmpfiles create a subdirectory
  "/var/log/named" owned by named:named and changing the file
  paths accordingly:
  /var/log/named_querylog -> /var/log/named/querylog
  /var/log/named_dump.db -> /var/log/named/dump.db
  /var/log/named.stats -> /var/log/named/stats
  Also, in "named.service", the ReadWritePath was changed to
  include "/var/log/named" rather than just "var/log".

  Bugs fixed:
  * When resolving a name, don't give up immediately if an
    authoritative server returns FORMERR; try the other servers first.
  * When synth-from-dnssec generated a response using records from a
    higher zone, it could unexpectedly prove non-existance of
    records in a subordinate grafted-on namespace.  
  * Update HTTP listener settings on reconfiguration.
  * Fix a crash in dig NS search mode when one of the NS server
    queries fail.
  * Changed dnssec-signzone -H default to 0 additional NSEC3
    iterations.
  * When processing a catalog zone member zone make sure that there
    is no configured pre-existing forward-only forw]ard zone with
    that name.

- Upgrade to 9.18.4:
  Bugs fixed:
  * Only write key files if the dnssec-policy keymgr has
    changed the metadata.
  * When the fetches-per-server quota was adjusted
    because of an authoritative server timing out more
    or less frequently, it was incorrectly set to 1
    rather than the intended value.
  Notable functional changes:
  * Key timing options for `dnssec-keygen` and
    `dnssec-settime` now accept times as printed by
    `dnssec-settime -p`.
  * Key timing options for `dnssec-settime` and related
    utilities now accept "UNSET" times as printed by
    `dnssec-settime -p`.

    TLS stream socket object deletion.
  * RPZ NSIP and NSDNAME rule processing didn't handle stub and
    static-stub zones at or above the query name. This has now
    been addressed.
  * Fixed a deadlock that could occur if an rndc connection arrived
    during the shutdown of network interfaces.
  * Refactor the fctx_done() function to set fctx to NULL after
    detaching, so that reference counting errors will be easier to
    avoid.
  * udp_recv() in dispatch could trigger an INSIST when the
    callback's result indicated success but the response was
    canceled in the meantime.
  * Work around a jemalloc quirk which could trigger an
    out-of-memory condition in named over time.
  * If there was a pending negative cache DS entry, validations
    depending upon it could fail.
  * dig returned a 0 exit status on UDP connection failure.
  * Fix an assertion failure when using dig with +nssearch and
    +tcp options by starting the next query in the send_done()
    callback (like in the UDP mode) instead of doing that
    recursively in start_tcp(). Also ensure that queries
    interrupted while connecting are detached properly.
  * Don't remove CDS/CDNSKEY DELETE records on zone sign when
    using 'auto-dnssec maintain;'.

Mon Apr 25 06:56:58 UTC 2022 - Josef Möllers <josef.moellers@suse.com>

- Upgrade to 9.18.2:
  Most important bugs fixed:
  * The "starting maxtime timer" message related to outgoing
    zone transfers was incorrectly logged at the ERROR level
    instead of DEBUG(1).
  * Ensure that zone maintenance queries have a retry limit.
  * When using both the `+qr` and `+y` options `dig` could
    crash if the connection to the first server was not
    successful.
  * dig could hang in some cases involving multiple servers
    in a lookup, when a request fails and the next one
    refuses to start for some reason, for example if it was
    an IPv4 mapped IPv6 address.
  * dig +nssearch was hanging until manually interrupted.
  * When an UPDATE targets a zone that is not configured,
    the requested zone name is now logged in the "not
    authoritative" error message, so that it is easier to
    track down problematic update clients.
  * Quote the dns64 prefix in error messages that complain
    about problems with it, to avoid confusion with the
    following dns64 ACLs.
  * When encountering socket error while trying to initiate
    a TCP connection to a server, dig could hang
    indefinitely, when there were more servers to try.
  * When timing-out or having other types of socket errors
    during a query, dig wasn't trying to perform the lookup
    using other servers, in case they exist.
  * Resending a UDP request in the result of a timeout
    could cause an assertion failure when the resent
    query's result was SERVFAIL.
  * Replace single TCP write timer with per-TCP write
    timers.
  * Invalid dnssec-policy definitions were being accepted
    where the defined keys did not cover both KSK and ZSK
    roles for a given algorithm.  This is now checked for
    and the dnssec-policy is rejected if both roles are
    not present for all algorithms in use.
  * Fix query context management issues in the TCP part
    of dig.

  Noteworthy functional changes:
  * Add new "reuseport" option to enable/disable load
    balancing of sockets.
  * Set the minimum MTU on UDPv6 and TCPv6 sockets and
    limit TCP maximum segment size (TCP_MAXSEG) to (1220)
    for both TCPv4 and TCPv6 sockets.

- * When using forwarders, bogus NS records supplied by, or via, those
    forwarders may be cached and used by named if it needs to recurse
    for any reason, causing it to obtain and pass on potentially
    incorrect answers. [CVE-2021-25220]
  * TCP connection slots may be consumed for an indefinite time frame
    via a specifically crafted TCP stream sent from a client.
    This issue can only be triggered on BIND servers which have
    keep-response-order enabled, which is not the default configuration.
    The keep-response-order option is an ACL block, and as such, any
    hosts specified within it will be able to trigger this issue on
    affected versions. [CVE-2022-0396]
  * The RFC 8198 Aggressive Use of DNSSEC-Validated Cache feature
    (synth-from-dnssec) had been refactored and the default has been
    changed so that is now automatically enabled for dnssec-validating
    resolvers. Subsequently it was found that repeated patterns of
    specific queries to servers with this feature enabled could cause
    an INSIST failure in query.c:query_dname which causes named to
    terminate unexpectedly.
    The vulnerability affects BIND resolvers running 9.18.0 that have
    both dnssec-validation and synth-from-dnssec enabled. (Note that
    dnssec-validation auto; is the default setting unless configured
    otherwise in named.conf and that enabling dnssec-validation
    automatically enables synth-from-dnssec unless explicitly disabled)
    [CVE-2022-0635]
  * The refactoring of the recursive client code introduced a
    "backstop lifetime timer."
    While BIND is processing a request for a DS record that needs to be
    forwarded, it waits until this processing is complete or until the
    backstop lifetime timer has timed out. When the resume_dslookup() function
    is called as a result of such a timeout, the function does not test
    whether the fetch has previously been shut down. This introduces the
    possibility of triggering an assertion failure, which could cause the BIND
    process to terminate. [CVE-2022-0667]
  * Reset client TCP connection when data received cannot
    be parsed as a valid DNS request.

- Update to new MAJOR VERSION 9.18.0.
  This has many enhnancements, bug fixes and changes.
  The spec file also has mechanisms to run the integrated test suite.

  MAJOR CHANGES:
  * Support for securing DNS traffic using Transport Layer Security (TLS).
    TLS is used by both DNS-over-TLS (DoT) and DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH).
  * Support for zone transfers over TLS (XFR-over-TLS, XoT) for both
    incoming and outgoing zone transfers.
  * The dig tool is now able to send DoT queries (+tls option).
  * Support for OpenSSL 3.0 APIs was added. 

  A number of utilities have been removed: dnssec-checkds,
  dnssec-coverage, dnssec-keymgr, which have been deprecated in
  favor of dnssec-policy feature, as well as python support
  (package python3-bind). 
  A number of utilities have been moved from (/usr)/sbin to (/usr)/bin
  The DLZ modules have been put into seperate sub-packages

    has finished, and the worker receive buffer has been marked as
    "freed".
  * Allow replacing expired zone signatures with signatures created
    by the KSK.
  * An assertion could occur if a catalog zone event was scheduled
    while the task manager was being shut down.
  * Defer detaching from zone->raw in zone_shutdown() if the zone
    is in the process of being dumped to disk, to ensure that the
    unsigned serial number information is always written in the
    raw-format header of the signed version on an inline-signed
    zone.
  * named could leak memory when two dnssec-policy clauses had the
    same name. named failed to log this error.
  * Add a missing isc_condition_destroy() for nmsocket condition
    variable and add missing isc_mutex_destroy() for nmworker lock.

    `rndc reconfig`.
  * dns_sdlz_putrr failed to process some valid resource records.
  * dnssec-dsfromkey failed to omit revoked keys.
  Functional change:

    say "Accepting TCP connection failed" and change the log level
    for ISC_R_NOTCONNECTED, ISC_R_QUOTA and ISC_R_SOFTQUOTA results
    codes from ERROR to INFO.

- Upgrade to 9.16.23
  Security issues fixed:
  The "lame-ttl" option is now forcibly set to 0. This
  effectively disables the lame server cache, as it could
  previously be abused by an attacker to significantly
  degrade resolver performance. (CVE-2021-25219)

  Bugs fixed:
  In 9.16.21:
  * When a dynamic zone was made available in another view
    using the "in-view" statement, running "rndc freeze"
    always reported an "already frozen" error even though
    the zone was successfully frozen.
  * Stale data in the cache could cause named to send
    non-minimized queries despite QNAME minimization being
    enabled.
  * When a DNSSEC-signed zone which only has a single
    signing key available is migrated to use KASP, that key
    is now treated as a Combined Signing Key (CSK).
  * When a member zone was removed from a catalog zone,
    journal files for the former were not deleted.
  * named-checkconf failed to detect syntactically invalid
    values of the "key" and "tls" parameters used to define
    members of remote server lists.
  * Fixed a regression which caused the EDNS TCP Keepalive option to be
    ignored inadvertently in client requests. It has now
    been fixed and this option is handled properly again.
  * Fixed a regression which altered the internal memory structure of
    zone databases, but neglected to update the MAPAPI value
    for zone files in "map" format. This caused named to
    attempt to load incompatible map files, triggering an
    assertion failure on startup. The MAPAPI value has now
    been updated, so named rejects outdated files when
    encountering them.
  * The thread-local isc_tid_v variable was not properly
    initialized when running BIND 9 as a Windows Service,
    leading to a crash on startup.
  * "map" files exceeding 2GB in size failed to load due to
    a size comparison that incorrectly treated the file size
    as a signed integer.
  In 9.16.22:
  * Remove the "adjust interface" mechanism which was
    responsible for setting up listeners on interfaces when
    the "*-source(-v6)" address and port were the same as
    the "listen-on(-v6)" address and port. Such a
    configuration is no longer supported; under certain
    timing conditions, that mechanism could prevent named
    from listening on some TCP ports. This has been fixed.
  * Multiple library names were mistakenly passed to the
    krb5-config utility when ./configure was invoked with
    the --with-gssapi=[/path/to/]krb5-config option. This
    has been fixed by invoking krb5-config separately for
    each required library.
  * Fixed a regression which broke backward compatibility for the 
    "check-names master ..." and "check-names slave ..."
    options. This has been fixed.
  * Address a potential deadlock when checking zone content
    consistency.
  In 9.16.23:
  * Address Coverity warning in lib/dns/dnssec.c.
  * Fix a bug when comparing two RSA keys. There was a typo
    which caused the "p" prime factors to not being
    compared.
  * Fix an assertion failure caused by missing member zones
    during a reload of a catalog zone.
  This obsoletes bind-CVE-2021-25219.patch and
  bind-fix-build-with-older-sphinx.patch

  A compile time waring about fall through in a switch statement
  has been averted by marking the cases as FALLTHROUGH.

- Fixed CVE-2021-25219:
  The lame-ttl option controls how long named caches certain types
  of broken responses from authoritative servers (see the security
  advisory for details). This caching mechanism could be abused by
  an attacker to significantly degrade resolver performance. The
  vulnerability has been mitigated by changing the default value of
  lame-ttl to 0 and overriding any explicitly set value with 0,
  effectively disabling this mechanism altogether. ISC's testing has
  determined that doing that has a negligible impact on resolver
  performance while also preventing abuse.
  Administrators may observe more traffic towards servers issuing
  certain types of broken responses than in previous BIND 9 releases.

  * named failed to check the opcode of responses when performing
    zone refreshes, stub zone updates, and UPDATE forwarding.
  * Some changes to "zone-statistics" settings were not properly
    processed by "rndc reconfig".
  * The "check DS" code failed to release all resources upon
    named shutdown when a refresh was in progress.
  * Authentication of rndc messages could fail if a "controls"
    statement was configured with multiple key algorithms for
    the same listener.

Thu Jul 29 13:14:28 UTC 2021 - Paolo Stivanin <info@paolostivanin.com>

- Update to 9.16.19
  * A race condition could occur where two threads were
    competing for the same set of key file locks, leading to
    a deadlock. This has been fixed. [GL #2786]
  * create_keydata() created an invalid placeholder keydata
    record upon a refresh failure, which prevented the
    database of managed keys from subsequently being read
    back. This has been fixed. [GL #2686]
  * KASP support was extended with the "check DS" feature.
    Zones with "dnssec-policy" and "parental-agents"
    configured now check for DS presence and can perform
    automatic KSK rollovers. [GL #1126]
  * Rescheduling a setnsec3param() task when a zone failed
    to load on startup caused a hang on shutdown. This has
    been fixed. [GL #2791]
  * The configuration-checking code failed to account for
    the inheritance rules of the "dnssec-policy" option.
    This has been fixed. [GL #2780]
  * If nsupdate sends an SOA request and receives a REFUSED
    response, it now fails over to the next available
    server. [GL #2758]
  * For UDP messages larger than the path MTU, named now
    sends an empty response with the TC (TrunCated) bit set.
    In addition, setting the DF (Don't Fragment) flag on
    outgoing UDP sockets was re-enabled. [GL #2790]
  * Views with recursion disabled are now configured with a
    default cache size of 2 MB unless "max-cache-size" is
    explicitly set. This prevents cache RBT hash tables from
    being needlessly preallocated for such views. [GL #2777]
  * Change 5644 inadvertently introduced a deadlock: when
    locking the key file mutex for each zone structure in a
    different view, the "in-view" logic was not considered.
    This has been fixed. [GL #2783]
  * Increasing "max-cache-size" for a running named instance
    (using "rndc reconfig") did not cause the hash tables
    used by cache databases to be grown accordingly. This
    has been fixed. [GL #2770]
  * Signed, insecure delegation responses prepared by named
    either lacked the necessary NSEC records or contained
    duplicate NSEC records when both wildcard expansion and
    CNAME chaining were required to prepare the response.
    This has been fixed. [GL #2759]
  * A bug that caused the NSEC3 salt to be changed on every
    restart for zones using KASP has been fixed. [GL #2725]

- Since BIND 9.9, it has been easier to use tsig-keygen and
  ddns-confgen to generare TSIG keys. In 9.13, TSIG support was
  removed from dnssec-keygen, so now it is just for DNSKEY (and KEY
  for obscure cases). tsig-keygen is now used to generate DDNS keys.

    inheritance rules of the "key-directory" option.
  * When preparing DNS responses, named could replace the letters
    'W' (uppercase) and 'w' (lowercase) with '\000'.
    This has been fixed.

    be enabled instead of disabled. This has been fixed.
  * The calculation of the estimated IXFR transaction size in
    dns_journal_iter_init() was invalid.
  * Fix a race condition in reading and writing key files for zones
    using KASP and configured in multiple views.
  * Zones which are configured in multiple views with different
    values set for "dnssec-policy" and with identical values set
    for "key-directory" are now detected and treated as a
    configuration error.
  * Address a potential memory leak in dst_key_fromnamedfile().
  * Check that the first and last SOA record of an AXFR are
    consistent.
  * Improvements related to network manager/task manager
    integration

- Upgrade to bind 9.16.16
  * Feature Changes
    + DNSSEC responses containing NSEC3 records with iteration counts
      greater than 150 are now treated as insecure. [GL #2445]
    + The maximum supported number of NSEC3 iterations that can be
      configured for a zone has been reduced to 150. [GL #2642]
    + The default value of the max-ixfr-ratio option was changed to
      unlimited, for better backwards compatibility in the stable
      release series. [GL #2671]
    + Zones that want to transition from secure to insecure mode
      without becoming bogus in the process must now have their
      dnssec-policy changed first to insecure, rather than none. After
      the DNSSEC records have been removed from the zone, the
      dnssec-policy can be set to none or removed from the
      configuration. Setting the dnssec-policy to insecure causes CDS
      and CDNSKEY DELETE records to be published. [GL #2645]
    + The implementation of the ZONEMD RR type has been updated to
      match RFC 8976. [GL #2658]
    + The draft-vandijk-dnsop-nsec-ttl IETF draft was implemented:
      NSEC(3) TTL values are now set to the minimum of the SOA MINIMUM
      value or the SOA TTL. [GL #2347]
  * Bug Fixes
    + It was possible for corrupt journal files generated by an earlier
      version of named to cause problems after an upgrade. This has been
      fixed. [GL #2670]
    + TTL values in cache dumps were reported incorrectly when
      stale-cache-enable was set to yes. This has been fixed.
      [GL #389] [GL #2289]
    + A deadlock could occur when multiple rndc addzone, rndc delzone,
      and/or rndc modzone commands were invoked simultaneously for
      different zones. This has been fixed. [GL #2626]
    + named and named-checkconf did not report an error when multiple
      zones with the dnssec-policy option set were using the same zone
      file. This has been fixed. [GL #2603]
    + If dnssec-policy was active and a private key file was temporarily
      offline during a rekey event, named could incorrectly introduce
      replacement keys and break a signed zone. This has been fixed.
      [GL #2596]
    + When generating zone signing keys, KASP now also checks for key
      ID conflicts among newly created keys, rather than just between
      new and existing ones. [GL #2628]

  * named crashed when a DNAME record placed in the ANSWER
    section during DNAME chasing turned out to be the final
    answer to a client query. (CVE-2021-25215)

  * Insufficient IXFR checks could result in named serving a
    zone without an SOA record at the apex, leading to a
    RUNTIME_CHECK assertion failure when the zone was
    subsequently refreshed. This has been fixed by adding an
    owner name check for all SOA records which are included

- *** MAJOR CHANGES ***
  * The libraries shipped with bind are now named after the bind
    version (eg libisc-9.16.10.so), not some kind of artificial
    number (eg libisc.so.1608)!
  * For the time being (ie until the next upgrade),
    new BIND option "stale-answer-client-timeout"
    will be disabled (in /etc/named.conf): "stale-answer-enable no;"
  * All libraries are now in bind-utils as they are used by bind
    and bind-utils only and bind requires bind-utils.
    This affects libdns, libirs, libisc, libisccc, libisccfg,
    libns
  * Dropped the devel packages as the libraries are used
    internally only.

  * Update to 9.16.12
    Bugs fixed:
    - KASP incorrectly set signature validity to the value of
      the DNSKEY signature validity.
    - Fix off-by-one bug in ISC SPNEGO implementation.
      (CVE-2020-8625)
    - Dig now reports unknown dash options while pre-parsing
      the options. This prevents "-multi" instead of "+multi"
      from reporting memory usage before ending option parsing
      with "Invalid option: -lti".
    - Fixed a crash in "dnssec-keyfromlabel" when using ECDSA
      keys.
    - Emit useful error message when "rndc retransfer" is
      applied to a zone of inappropriate type.
    - Improve performance of the DNSSEC verification code by
      reducing the number of repeated calls to
      dns_dnssec_keyfromrdata().
    - named failed to start when its configuration included a
      zone with a non-builtin "allow-update" ACL attached.
    - Address potential double free in generatexml().
    - When migrating to KASP, BIND 9 considered keys with the
      "Inactive" and/or "Delete" timing metadata to be 
      possible active keys.
    - Fix the "three is a crowd" key rollover bug in KASP by
      correctly implementing Equation (2) of the "Flexible and
      Robust Key Rollover" paper.

  * dnssec-keygen can no longer generate HMAC keys.
    Use tsig-keygen instead.
    genDDNSkey script was modified to reflect this.

Tue Dec 29 19:28:46 UTC 2020 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 9.16.10:
  New Features:
  * NSEC3 support was added to KASP. A new option for dnssec-policy,
  nsec3param, can be used to set the desired NSEC3 parameters. NSEC3 salt
  collisions are automatically prevented during resalting. [GL #1620]

  * A new configuration option, stale-refresh-time, has been introduced. It allows
  a stale RRset to be served directly from cache for a period of time after a
  failed lookup, before a new attempt to refresh it is made. [GL #2066]

  Feature Changes:
  * The default value of max-recursion-queries was increased from 75 to 100.
  Since the queries sent towards root and TLD servers are now included in the
  count (as a result of the fix for CVE-2020-8616), max-recursion-queries has
  a higher chance of being exceeded by non-attack queries, which is the main
  reason for increasing its default value. [GL #2305]

  The default value of nocookie-udp-size was restored back to 4096 bytes. Since
  max-udp-size is the upper bound for nocookie-udp-size, this change relieves the
  operator from having to change nocookie-udp-size together with max-udp-size in
  order to increase the default EDNS buffer size limit. nocookie-udp-size can
  still be set to a value lower than max-udp-size, if desired. [GL #2250]

  Bug Fixes:
  Handling of missing DNS COOKIE responses over UDP was tightened by falling
  back to TCP. [GL #2275]

  The CNAME synthesized from a DNAME was incorrectly followed when the QTYPE was
  CNAME or ANY. [GL #2280]

  Building with native PKCS#11 support for AEP Keyper has been broken since BIND
  9.16.6. This has been fixed. [GL #2315]

  named could crash with an assertion failure if a TCP connection were closed
  while a request was still being processed. [GL #2227]

  named acting as a resolver could incorrectly treat signed zones with no DS
  record at the parent as bogus. Such zones should be treated as insecure. This
  has been fixed. [GL #2236]

  After a Negative Trust Anchor (NTA) is added, BIND performs periodic checks
  to see if it is still necessary. If BIND encountered a failure while creating a
  query to perform such a check, it attempted to dereference a NULL pointer,
  resulting in a crash. [GL #2244]

  A problem obtaining glue records could prevent a stub zone from functioning
  properly, if the authoritative server for the zone were configured for minimal
  responses. [GL #1736]

  UV_EOF is no longer treated as a TCP4RecvErr or a TCP6RecvErr. [GL #2208]

Wed Oct 28 12:50:56 UTC 2020 - Josef Möllers <josef.moellers@suse.com>

- Upgrade to version 9.16.8
  New Features:
  * Add a new rndc command, "rndc dnssec -rollover", which triggers a
    manual rollover for a specific key.
  * Add a new rndc command, "rndc dumpdb -expired", which dumps the
    cache database, including expired RRsets that are awaiting
    cleanup, to the dump-file for diagnostic purposes.
  Bug Fixes:
  * named reported an invalid memory size when running in an environment
    that did not properly report the number of available memory pages
    and/or the size of each memory page.
  * With multiple forwarders configured, named could fail the
    REQUIRE(msg->state == (-1)) assertion in lib/dns/message.c,
    causing it to crash. This has been fixed.
  * named erroneously performed continuous key rollovers for KASP
    policies that used algorithm Ed25519 or Ed448 due to a mismatch
    between created key size and expected key size.
  * Updating contents of an RPZ zone which contained names spelled
    using varying letter case could cause some processing rules in
    that RPZ zone to be erroneously ignored.
  Local changes:
  * Add /usr/lib64/named to the files and directories in
    bind-chrootenv.conf. This directory contains plugins loaded
    after the chroot().

  * Fix (non-)publication of CDS and CDNSKEY records.
  * 'dig +bufsize=0' failed to disable EDNS.
  * Address a TSAN report by ensuring each rate limiter
    object holds a reference to its task.
  * With query minimization enabled, named failed to
    resolve ip6.arpa. names that had extra labels to the
    left of the IPv6 part.
  * Silence the EPROTO syslog message on older systems.
  * Fix off-by-one error when calculating new hash table size.
  * Tighten LOC parsing to reject a period (".") and/or "m"
    as a value. Fix handling of negative altitudes which are
    not whole meters.
  * rbtversion->glue_table_size could be read without the
    appropriate lock being held.
  * Named erroneously accepted certain invalid resource
    records that were incorrectly processed after
    subsequently being written to disk and loaded back, as
    the wire format differed. Such records include: CERT,
    IPSECKEY, NSEC3, NSEC3PARAM, NXT, SIG, TLSA, WKS, and X25.
  * NTA code needed to have a weak reference on its
    associated view to prevent the latter from being deleted
    while NTA tests were being performed.
  * replace an INSIST() (which calls abort()) with a check and
    an error message.

  of /usr/sbin/dnssec-keygen as BIND now uses the random number
  functions provided by the crypto library (i.e., OpenSSL or a
  PKCS#11 provider) as a source of randomness rather than /dev/random.
  Therefore the -r command line option no longer has any effect on
  dnssec-keygen. Leaving the option in genDDNSkey as to not break
  compatibility. Patch provided by Stefan Eisenwiener.

- Upgrade to version 9.16.6
  Fixes five vilnerabilities:
  5481.   [security]      "update-policy" rules of type "subdomain" were
                          incorrectly treated as "zonesub" rules, which allowed
                          keys used in "subdomain" rules to update names outside
                          of the specified subdomains. The problem was fixed by
                          making sure "subdomain" rules are again processed as
                          described in the ARM. (CVE-2020-8624) [GL #2055]

  5480.   [security]      When BIND 9 was compiled with native PKCS#11 support, it
                          was possible to trigger an assertion failure in code

Tue Jul 21 14:06:51 UTC 2020 - Josef Möllers <josef.moellers@suse.com>

- Upgrade to version bind-9.16.5
  * The "primary" and "secondary" keywords, when used
    as parameters for "check-names", were not
    processed correctly and were being ignored.
  * 'rndc dnstap -roll <value>' did not limit the number of
    saved files to <value>.
  * Add 'rndc dnssec -status' command.
  * Addressed a couple of situations where named could crash
  For the full list, see the CHANGES file in the source RPM.

Tue Jun 30 08:32:21 UTC 2020 - Josef Möllers <josef.moellers@suse.com>

- Changed /var/lib/named to owner root:named and perms rwxrwxr-t
  so that named, being a/the only member of the "named" group
  has full r/w access yet cannot change directories owned by root
  in the case of a compromized named.

Thu Jun 18 06:35:35 UTC 2020 - Josef Möllers <josef.moellers@suse.com>

- Upgrade to version bind-9.16.4
  Fixing two security problems: 
  * It was possible to trigger an INSIST when determining
    whether a record would fit into a TCP message buffer.
    (CVE-2020-8618)
  * It was possible to trigger an INSIST in
    lib/dns/rbtdb.c:new_reference() with a particular zone
    content and query patterns. (CVE-2020-8619)
  Also the following functional changes:
  * Reject DS records at the zone apex when loading
    master files. Log but otherwise ignore attempts to
    add DS records at the zone apex via UPDATE.
  * The default value of "max-stale-ttl" has been changed
    from 1 week to 12 hours.
  * Zone timers are now exported via statistics channel.
    Thanks to Paul Frieden, Verizon Media.
  Added support for idn2 to spec file (Thanks to Holger Bruenjes
  <holgerbruenjes@gmx.net>).

- Upgrade to version bind-9.16.3
  Fixing two security problems:
  * Further limit the number of queries that can be triggered from
    a request.  Root and TLD servers are no longer exempt
    from max-recursion-queries.  Fetches for missing name server
    address records are limited to 4 for any domain. (CVE-2020-8616)
  * Replaying a TSIG BADTIME response as a request could trigger an
    assertion failure. (CVE-2020-8617)
  Also
  * Add engine support to OpenSSL EdDSA implementation.
  * Add engine support to OpenSSL ECDSA implementation.
  * Update PKCS#11 EdDSA implementation to PKCS#11 v3.0.
  * Warn about AXFR streams with inconsistent message IDs.
  * Make ISC rwlock implementation the default again.

    be used for sending traffic.
  * The system-provided POSIX Threads read-write lock implementation
    is now used by default instead of the native BIND 9 implementation.
  * Fixed re-signing issues with inline zones which resulted in records
    being re-signed late or not at all.

- Upgrade to version 9.16.0
  Major upgrade, see
  https://downloads.isc.org/isc/bind9/9.16.0/RELEASE-NOTES-bind-9.16.0.html
  and
  CHANGES file in the source tree.
  Major functional change:
  * What was set with --with-tuning=large option in older BIND9
    versions is now a default, and a --with-tuning=small option was
    added for small (e.g. OpenWRT) systems.
  * A new "dnssec-policy" option has been added to named.conf to
    implement a key and signing policy (KASP) for zones.
  * The command (and manpage) bind9-config have been dropped as the
    BIND 9 libraries are now purely internal.
  No patches became obsolete through the upgrade.

  TSIG keys for protection with no other ACL protection could be
  manipulated into (1) providing an AXFR of a zone to an
  unauthorized recipient and (2) accepting bogus Notify packets.

    be mishandled, resulting in an assertion failure
    (CVE-2015-8705, bsc#962190).
  * Authoritative servers that were marked as bogus (e.g.
    blackholed in configuration or with invalid addresses) were
    being queried anyway.

Wed Jul 29 19:24:40 UTC 2015 - lmuelle@suse.com

- Update to version 9.10.2-P3
  Security Fixes
  * A specially crafted query could trigger an assertion failure in message.c.
    This flaw was discovered by Jonathan Foote, and is disclosed in
    CVE-2015-5477. [RT #39795]
  * On servers configured to perform DNSSEC validation, an assertion failure
    could be triggered on answers from a specially configured server.
    This flaw was discovered by Breno Silveira Soares, and is disclosed
    in CVE-2015-4620. [RT #39795]
  Bug Fixes
  * Asynchronous zone loads were not handled correctly when the zone load was
    already in progress; this could trigger a crash in zt.c. [RT #37573]
  * Several bugs have been fixed in the RPZ implementation:
    + Policy zones that did not specifically require recursion could be treated
      as if they did; consequently, setting qname-wait-recurse no; was
      sometimes ineffective. This has been corrected. In most configurations,
      behavioral changes due to this fix will not be noticeable. [RT #39229]
    + The server could crash if policy zones were updated (e.g. via
      rndc reload or an incoming zone transfer) while RPZ processing
      was still ongoing for an active query. [RT #39415]
    + On servers with one or more policy zones configured as slaves, if a
      policy zone updated during regular operation (rather than at startup)
      using a full zone reload, such as via AXFR, a bug could allow the RPZ
      summary data to fall out of sync, potentially leading to an assertion
      failure in rpz.c when further incremental updates were made to the zone,
      such as via IXFR. [RT #39567]
    + The server could match a shorter prefix than what was
      available in CLIENT-IP policy triggers, and so, an unexpected
      action could be taken. This has been corrected. [RT #39481]
    + The server could crash if a reload of an RPZ zone was initiated while
      another reload of the same zone was already in progress. [RT #39649]

    further incremental updates were made to the zone, such as via IXFR.
    [RT #39567]

    while recursion was pending for RPZ processing of an active query.
    [RT #39415]

    already in progress; this could trigger a crash in zt.c. [RT #37573]
  - Fix an out-of-bounds read in RPZ code. If the read succeeded, it doesn't
    result in a bug during operation. If the read failed, named could segfault.

Tue Dec  9 21:45:10 UTC 2014 - lmuelle@suse.com

- Update to version 9.10.1-P1
  - A flaw in delegation handling could be exploited to put named into an
    infinite loop.  This has been addressed by placing limits on the number of
    levels of recursion named will allow (default 7), and the number of
    iterative queries that it will send (default 50) before terminating a
    recursive query (CVE-2014-8500); (bnc#908994).
    The recursion depth limit is configured via the "max-recursion-depth"
    option, and the query limit via the "max-recursion-queries" option.
    [RT #37580]
  - When geoip-directory was reconfigured during named run-time, the
    previously loaded GeoIP data could remain, potentially causing wrong ACLs
    to be used or wrong results to be served based on geolocation
    (CVE-2014-8680). [RT #37720]; (bnc#908995).
  - Lookups in GeoIP databases that were not loaded could cause an assertion
    failure (CVE-2014-8680). [RT #37679]; (bnc#908995).
  - The caching of GeoIP lookups did not always handle address families
    correctly, potentially resulting in an assertion failure (CVE-2014-8680).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Nov 29 19:35:53 UTC 2014 - lmuelle@suse.com

- Update to version 9.10.1
  - This release addresses the security flaws described in CVE-2014-3214 and
    CVE-2014-3859.
- Update to version 9.10.0
  - DNS Response-rate limiting (DNS RRL), which blunts the impact of
    reflection and amplification attacks, is always compiled in and no longer
    requires a compile-time option to enable it.
  - An experimental "Source Identity Token" (SIT) EDNS option is now available.
  - A new zone file format, "map", stores zone data in a
    format that can be mapped directly into memory, allowing
    significantly faster zone loading.
  - "delv" (domain entity lookup and validation) is a new tool with dig-like
    semantics for looking up DNS data and performing internal DNSSEC
    validation.
  - Improved EDNS(0) processing for better resolver performance
    and reliability over slow or lossy connections.
  - Substantial improvement in response-policy zone (RPZ) performance.  Up to
    32 response-policy zones can be configured with minimal performance loss.
  - To improve recursive resolver performance, cache records which are still
    being requested by clients can now be automatically refreshed from the
    authoritative server before they expire, reducing or eliminating the time
    window in which no answer is available in the cache.
  - New "rpz-client-ip" triggers and drop policies allowing
    response policies based on the IP address of the client.
  - ACLs can now be specified based on geographic location using the MaxMind
    GeoIP databases.  Use "configure --with-geoip" to enable.
  - Zone data can now be shared between views, allowing multiple views to serve
    the same zones authoritatively without storing multiple copies in memory.
  - New XML schema (version 3) for the statistics channel includes many new
    statistics and uses a flattened XML tree for faster parsing. The older
    schema is now deprecated.
  - A new stylesheet, based on the Google Charts API, displays XML statistics
    in charts and graphs on javascript-enabled browsers.
  - The statistics channel can now provide data in JSON format as well as XML.
  - New stats counters track TCP and UDP queries received
    per zone, and EDNS options received in total.
  - The internal and export versions of the BIND libraries (libisc, libdns,
    etc) have been unified so that external library clients can use the same
    libraries as BIND itself.
  - A new compile-time option, "configure --enable-native-pkcs11", allows BIND
    9 cryptography functions to use the PKCS#11 API natively, so that BIND can
    drive a cryptographic hardware service module (HSM) directly instead of
    using a modified OpenSSL as an intermediary.
  - The new "max-zone-ttl" option enforces maximum TTLs for zones. This can
    simplify the process of rolling DNSSEC keys by guaranteeing that cached
    signatures will have expired within the specified amount of time.
  - "dig +subnet" sends an EDNS CLIENT-SUBNET option when querying.
  - "dig +expire" sends an EDNS EXPIRE option when querying.
  - New "dnssec-coverage" tool to check DNSSEC key coverage for a zone and
    report if a lapse in signing coverage has been inadvertently scheduled.
  - Signing algorithm flexibility and other improvements
    for the "rndc" control channel.
  - "named-checkzone" and "named-compilezone" can now read
    journal files, allowing them to process dynamic zones.
  - Multiple DLZ databases can now be configured.  Individual zones can be
    configured to be served from a specific DLZ database.  DLZ databases now
    serve zones of type "master" and "redirect".
  - "rndc zonestatus" reports information about a specified zone.
  - "named" now listens on IPv6 as well as IPv4 interfaces by default.
  - "named" now preserves the capitalization of names
    when responding to queries.
  - new "dnssec-importkey" command allows the use of offline
    DNSSEC keys with automatic DNSKEY management.
  - New "named-rrchecker" tool to verify the syntactic
    correctness of individual resource records.
  - When re-signing a zone, the new "dnssec-signzone -Q" option drops
    signatures from keys that are still published but are no longer active.
  - "named-checkconf -px" will print the contents of configuration files with
    the shared secrets obscured, making it easier to share configuration (e.g.
    when submitting a bug report) without revealing private information.
  - "rndc scan" causes named to re-scan network interfaces for
    changes in local addresses.
  - On operating systems with support for routing sockets, network interfaces
    are re-scanned automatically whenever they change.
  - "tsig-keygen" is now available as an alternate command
    name to use for "ddns-confgen".
- Update to version 9.9.6
  New Features
  - Support for CAA record types, as described in RFC 6844 "DNS
    Certification Authority Authorization (CAA) Resource Record",
    was added. [RT#36625] [RT #36737]
  - Disallow "request-ixfr" from being specified in zone statements where it
    is not valid (it is only valid for slave and redirect zones) [RT #36608]
  - Support for CDS and CDNSKEY resource record types was added. For
    details see the proposed Informational Internet-Draft "Automating
    DNSSEC Delegation Trust Maintenance" at
    http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-dnsop-delegation-trust-maintainance-14.
    [RT #36333]
  - Added version printing options to various BIND utilities. [RT #26057]
    [RT #10686]
  - Added a "no-case-compress" ACL, which causes named to use case-insensitive
    compression (disabling change #3645) for specified clients. (This is useful
    when dealing with broken client implementations that use case-sensitive
    name comparisons, rejecting responses that fail to match the capitalization
    of the query that was sent.) [RT #35300]
  Feature Changes
  - Adds RPZ SOA to the additional section of responses to clearly
    indicate the use of RPZ in a manner that is intended to avoid
    causing issues for downstream resolvers and forwarders [RT #36507]
  - rndc now gives distinct error messages when an unqualified zone
    name matches multiple views vs. matching no views [RT #36691]
  - Improves the accuracy of dig's reported round trip times.  [RT #36611]
  - When an SPF record exists in a zone but no equivalent TXT record
    does, a warning will be issued.  The warning for the reverse
    condition is no longer issued. See the check-spf option in the
    documentation for details. [RT #36210]
  - "named" will now log explicitly when using rndc.key to configure
    command channel. [RT #35316]
  - The default setting for the -U option (setting the number of UDP
    listeners per interface) has been adjusted to improve performance.
    [RT #35417]
  - Aging of smoothed round-trip time measurements is now limited
    to no more than once per second, to improve accuracy in selecting
    the best name server. [RT #32909]
  - DNSSEC keys that have been marked active but have no publication
    date are no longer presumed to be publishable. [RT #35063]
  Bug Fixes
  - The Makefile in bin/python was changed to work around a bmake
    bug in FreeBSD 10 and NetBSD 6. [RT #36993] (**)
  - Corrected bugs in the handling of wildcard records by the DNSSEC
    validator: invalid wildcard expansions could be treated as valid
    if signed, and valid wildcard expansions in NSEC3 opt-out ranges
    had the AD bit set incorrectly in responses. [RT #37093] [RT #37072]
  - When resigning, dnssec-signzone was removing all signatures from
    delegation nodes. It now retains DS and (if applicable) NSEC
    signatures.  [RT #36946]
  - The AD flag was being set inappopriately on RPZ responses. [RT #36833]
  - Updates the URI record type to current draft standard,
    draft-faltstrom-uri-08, and allows the value field to be zero
    length [RT #36642] [RT #36737]
  - RRSIG sets that were not loaded in a single transaction at start
    up were not being correctly added to re-signing heaps.  [RT #36302]
  - Setting '-t aaaa' in .digrc had unintended side-effects. [RT #36452]
  - A race condition could cause a crash in isc_event_free during
    shutdown.  [RT #36720]
  - Addresses a race condition issue in dispatch. [RT #36731]
  - acl elements could be miscounted, causing a crash while loading
    a config [RT #36675]
  - Corrects a deadlock between view.c and adb.c. [RT #36341]
  - liblwres wasn't properly handling link-local addresses in
    nameserver clauses in resolv.conf. [RT #36039]
  - Buffers in isc_print_vsnprintf were not properly initialized
    leading to potential overflows when printing out quad values.
    [RT #36505]
  - Don't call qsort() with a null pointer, and disable the GCC 4.9
    "delete null pointer check" optimizer option. This fixes problems
    when using GNU GCC 4.9.0 where its compiler code optimizations
    may cause crashes in BIND. For more information, see the operational
    advisory at https://kb.isc.org/article/AA-01167/. [RT #35968]
  - Fixed a bug that could cause repeated resigning of records in
    dynamically signed zones. [RT #35273]
  - Fixed a bug that could cause an assertion failure after forwarding
    was disabled. [RT #35979]
  - Fixed a bug that caused SERVFAILs when using RPZ on a system
    configured as a forwarder. [RT #36060]
  - Worked around a limitation in Solaris's /dev/poll implementation
    that could cause named to fail to start when configured to use
    more sockets than the system could accomodate. [RT #35878]
- Remove merged rpz2+rl-9.9.5.patch and obsoleted rpz2+rl-9.9.5.patch
- Removed pid-path.diff patch as /run/{named,lwresd}/ are used by default.
- Update baselibs.conf (added libirs and library interface version updates).

  - [bug] Address double dns_zone_detach when switching to using automatic
    empty zones from regular zones. [RT #35177]
  - [port] Use built-in versions of strptime() and timegm() on all platforms
    to avoid portability issues. [RT #35183]
  - [bug] Address a portentry locking issue in dispatch.c. [RT #35128]
  - [bug] irs_resconf_load now returns ISC_R_FILENOTFOUND on a missing
    resolv.conf file and initializes the structure as if it had been
    configured with  nameserver ::1 nameserver 127.0.0.1  [RT #35194]
  - [contrib] queryperf: Fixed a possible integer overflow when printing
    results. [RT #35182]
  - [protocol] Accept integer timestamps in RRSIG records. [RT #35185]
  - [func] named-checkconf can now obscure shared secrets when printing by
    specifying '-x'. [RT #34465]
  - [bug] Improvements to statistics channel XSL stylesheet: the stylesheet can
    now be cached by the browser; section headers are omitted from the stats
    display when there is no data in those sections to be displayed; counters
    are now right-justified for easier readability. (Only available with
    configure --enable-newstats.) [RT #35117]
  - [cleanup] Replaced all uses of memcpy() with memmove(). [RT #35120]
  - [bug] Handle "." as a search list element when IDN support is enabled.
    [RT #35133]

    exist or is not a directory. [RT #35108]
  - [security] memcpy was incorrectly called with overlapping ranges resulting
    in malformed names being generated on some platforms.  This could cause
    INSIST failures when serving NSEC3 signed zones (CVE-2014-0591).
    [RT #35120]
  - [bug] Two calls to dns_db_getoriginnode were fatal if there was no data at
    the node. [RT #35080]
  - [bug] Iterative responses could be missed when the source port for an
    upstream query was the same as the listener port (53). [RT #34925]
  - [bug] Fixed a bug causing an insecure delegation from one static-stub zone
    to another to fail with a broken trust chain. [RT #35081]
  - [bug] loadnode could return a freed node on out of memory. [RT #35106]
  - [bug] Address null pointer dereference in zone_xfrdone. [RT #35042]

    published but no longer active. [RT #34990]
  - [bug] "rndc refresh" didn't work correctly with slave zones usingi
    inline-signing. [RT #35105]
  - [cleanup] Add a more detailed "not found" message to rndc commands which
    specify a zone name. [RT #35059]
  - [bug] Correct the behavior of rndc retransfer to allow inline-signing slave

Thu Dec  6 08:00:31 UTC 2012 - meissner@suse.com

- Updated to 9.9.2-P1 (bnc#792926)
  https://kb.isc.org/article/AA-00828
  * Security Fixes

    Prevents named from aborting with a require assertion failure on
    servers with DNS64 enabled.  These crashes might occur as a result of
    specific queries that are received.  (Note that this fix is a subset
    of a series of updates that will be included in full in BIND 9.8.5
    and 9.9.3 as change #3388, RT #30996).  [CVE-2012-5688] [RT #30792]

    A deliberately constructed combination of records could cause
    named to hang while populating the additional section of a
    response. [CVE-2012-5166] [RT #31090]

    Prevents a named assert (crash) when queried for a record whose
    RDATA exceeds 65535 bytes.  [CVE-2012-4244]  [RT #30416]

    Prevents a named assert (crash) when validating caused by using
    "Bad cache" data before it has been initialized. [CVE-2012-3817]
    [RT #30025]

    A condition has been corrected where improper handling of zero-length
    RDATA could cause undesirable behavior, including termination of
    the named process. [CVE-2012-1667]  [RT #29644]

    ISC_QUEUE handling for recursive clients was updated to address a race
    condition that could cause a memory leak. This rarely occurred with
    UDP clients, but could be a significant problem for a server handling
    a steady rate of TCP queries. [CVE-2012-3868]  [RT #29539 & #30233]

New Features

    Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm keys and signatures in
    DNSSEC are now supported per RFC 6605. [RT #21918]

    Introduces a new tool "dnssec-checkds" command that checks a zone to
    determine which DS records should be published in the parent zone,
    or which DLV records should be published in a DLV zone, and queries
    the DNS to ensure that it exists. (Note: This tool depends on python;
    it will not be built or installed on systems that do not have a
    python interpreter.)  [RT #28099]

    Introduces a new tool "dnssec-verify" that validates a signed zone,
    checking for the correctness of signatures and NSEC/NSEC3 chains.
    [RT #23673]

    Adds configuration option "max-rsa-exponent-size <value>;" that
    can be used to specify the maximum rsa exponent size that will be
    accepted when validating [RT #29228]

Feature Changes

    Improves OpenSSL error logging [RT #29932]
    nslookup now returns a nonzero exit code when it is unable to get
    an answer.  [RT #29492]

Bug Fixes

    Uses binary mode to open raw files on Windows.  [RT #30944]
    When using DNSSEC inline signing with "rndc signing -nsec3param", a
    salt value of "-" can now be used to indicate 'no salt'.  [RT #30099]
    Prevents race conditions (address use after free) that could be
    encountered when named is shutting down and releasing structures
    used to manage recursive clients.  [RT #30241]
    Static-stub zones now accept "forward" and "fowarders" options
    (often needed for subdomains of the zone referenced to override
    global forwarding options).  These options are already available
    with traditional stub zones and their omission from zones of type
    "static-stub" was an inadvertent oversight. [RT #30482]
    Limits the TTL of signed RRsets in cache when their RRSIGs are
    approaching expiry. This prevents the persistence in cache of
    invalid RRSIGs in order to assist recovery from a situation where
    zone re-signing doesn't occur in a timely manner.   With this change,
    named will attempt to obtain new RRSIGs from the authoritative server
    once the original ones have expired, and even if the TTL of the old
    records would in other circumstances cause them to be kept in cache
    for longer.  [RT #26429]
    Corrects the syntax of isc_atomic_xadd() and isc_atomic_cmpxchg()
    which are employed on Itanium systems to speed up lock management
    by making use of atomic operations.  Without the syntax correction
    it is possible that concurrent access to the same structures could
    accidentally occur with unpredictable results.  [RT #25181]
    Improves OpenSSL error logging [RT #29932]
    The configure script now supports and detects libxml2-2.8.x correctly
    [RT #30440]
    The host command should no longer assert on some architectures
    and builds while handling the time values used with the -w (wait
    forever) option.  [RT #18723]
    Invalid zero settings for max-retry-time, min-retry-time,
    max-refresh-time, min-refresh-time will now be detected during parsing
    of named.conf and an error emitted instead of triggering an assertion
    failure on startup.  [RT #27730]
    Removes spurious newlines from log messages in zone.c [RT #30675]
    When built with readline support (i.e. on a system with readline
    installed) nsupdate no longer terminates unexpectedly in interactive
    mode. [RT #29550]
    All named tasks that perform task-exclusive operations now share the
    same single task.  Prior to this change, there was the possibility of
    a race condition between rndc operations and other functions such as
    re-sizing the adb hash table.  If the race condition was encountered,
    named would in most cases terminate unexpectedly with an assert.
    [RT #29872]
    Ensures that servers are expired from the ADB cache when the timeout
    limit is reached so that their learned attributes can be refreshed.
    Prior to this change, servers that were frequently queried might
    never have their entries removed and reinitialized.  This is of
    particular importance to DNSSEC-validating recursive servers that
    might erroneously set "no-edns" for an authoritative server following
    a period of intermittent connectivity. [RT #29856]
    Adds additional resilience to a previous security change (3218) by
    preventing RRSIG data from being added to cache when a pseudo-record
    matching the covering type and proving non-existence exists at a
    higher trust level. The earlier change prevented this inconsistent
    data from being retrieved from cache in response to client queries  -
    with this additional change, the RRSIG records are no longer inserted
    into cache at all. [RT #26809]
    dnssec-settime will now issue a warning when the writing of a new
    private key file would cause a change in the permissions of the
    existing file. [RT #27724]
    Fixes the defect introduced by change #3314 that was causing failures
    when saving stub zones to disk (resulting in excessive CPU usage in
    some cases).  [RT #29952]
    Address race condition in units tests: asyncload_zone and
    asyncload_zt. [RT #26100]
    It is now possible to using multiple control keys again - this
    functionality was inadvertently broken by change #3924 (RT #28265)
    which addressed a memory leak. [RT #29694]
    Named now holds a zone table reference while performing an
    asynchronous load of a zone.  This removes a race condition that
    could cause named to crash when zones are added using rndc addzone
    or by manually editing named's configuration file followed by rndc
    reconfig/reload. [RT #28326]
    Setting resolver-query-timeout too low could cause named problems
    recovering after a loss of connectivity.  [RT #29623]
    Reduces the potential build-up of stale RRsets in cache on a busy
    recursive nameserver by re-using cached DS and RRSIG rrsets when
    possible [RT #29446]
    Corrects a failure to authenticate non-existence of resource records
    in some circumstances when RPZ has been configured.  Also:
        adds an optional "recursive-only yes|no" to the response-policy
        statement
        adds an optional "max-policy-ttl" to the response-policy statement
        to limit the false data that "recursive-only no" can introduce
        into resolvers' caches
        introduces a predefined encoding of PASSTHRU policy by adding
        "rpz-passthru" to be used as the target of CNAME policy records
        (the old encoding is still accepted.)
        adds a RPZ performance test to bin/tests/system/rpz when queryperf is available.  [RT #26172]
    Upper-case/lower-case handling of RRSIG signer-names is now handled
    consistently: RRSIG records are generated with the signer-name in
    lower case. They are accepted with any case, but if they fail to
    validate, we try again in lower case. [RT #27451]

  records
- Local copies of slave zones are now saved in raw format by
  default to improve startup performance
  BIND 9.9 changes the default storage format for slave zone
  files from text to raw.  Because named's behavior when a slave
  server cannot read or parse a zone file is to move the offending
  file out of the way and retransfer the zone, slave servers
  that are updated from a pre-9.9.0 version of BIND and which
  have existing copies of slave zone data may wind up with
  extraneous copies of zone data stored, as the existing
  text-format zone file copies will be moved aside to filenames
  of the format db-###### and journal files to the format
  jn-######  (where # represents a hexadecimal digit.)

- very first restart can create broken chroot
  (bnc#718441)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep  5 11:41:49 CEST 2011 - ug@suse.de

* fixed SSL in chroot environment (bnc#715881)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep  5 10:19:34 CEST 2011 - ug@suse.de

* Added a new include file with function typedefs for the DLZ
  "dlopen" driver. [RT #23629]
* Added a tool able to generate malformed packets to allow testing of
  how named handles them. [RT #24096]
* The root key is now provided in the file bind.keys allowing DNSSEC
  validation to be switched on at start up by adding
  "dnssec-validation auto;" to named.conf. If the root key provided
  has expired, named will log the expiration and validation will not
  work. More information and the most current copy of bind.keys can
  be found at http://www.isc.org/bind-keys. *Please note this feature
  was actually added in 9.8.0 but was not included in the 9.8.0
  release notes. [RT #21727]
* If named is configured with a response policy zone (RPZ) and a
  query of type RRSIG is received for a name configured for RRset
  replacement in that RPZ, it will trigger an INSIST and crash the
  server. RRSIG. [RT #24280]
* named, set up to be a caching resolver, is vulnerable to a user
  querying a domain with very large resource record sets (RRSets)
  when trying to negatively cache the response. Due to an off-by-one
  error, caching the response could cause named to crash. [RT #24650]
  [CVE-2011-1910]
* Using Response Policy Zone (RPZ) to query a wildcard CNAME label
  with QUERY type SIG/RRSIG, it can cause named to crash. Fix is
  query type independant. [RT #24715]
* Using Response Policy Zone (RPZ) with DNAME records and querying
  the subdomain of that label can cause named to crash. Now logs that
  DNAME is not supported. [RT #24766]
* Change #2912 populated the message section in replies to UPDATE
  requests, which some Windows clients wanted. This exposed a latent
  bug that allowed the response message to crash named. With this
  fix, change 2912 has been reduced to copy only the zone section to
  the reply. A more complete fix for the latent bug will be released
  later. [RT #24777]
* many bugfixes (see CHANGELOG)
* 9.8.1

Tue Jul  5 15:24:10 CEST 2011 - ug@suse.de

* Using Response Policy Zone (RPZ) with DNAME records and querying
  the subdomain of that label can cause named to crash. Now logs that
  DNAME is not supported. [RT #24766]
* If named is configured to be both authoritative and resursive and
  receives a recursive query for a CNAME in a zone that it is
  authoritative for, if that CNAME also points to a zone the server
  is authoritative for, the recursive part of name will not follow
  the CNAME change and the response will not be a complete CNAME
  chain. [RT #24455]
* Using Response Policy Zone (RPZ) to query a wildcard CNAME label
  with QUERY type SIG/RRSIG, it can cause named to crash. Fix is
  query type independant. [RT #24715] [CVE-2011-1907]
* Change #2912 (see CHANGES) exposed a latent bug in the DNS message
  processing code that could allow certain UPDATE requests to crash
  named. This was fixed by disambiguating internal database
  representation vs DNS wire format data. [RT #24777] [CVE-2011-2464]
* 9.8.0-P4

- Zones may be dynamically added and removed with the "rndc addzone"
  and "rndc delzone" commands. These dynamically added zones are
  written to a per-view configuration file. Do not rely on the
  configuration file name nor contents as this will change in a
  future release. This is an experimental feature at this time.
- Added new "filter-aaaa-on-v4" access control list to select which
  IPv4 clients have AAAA record filtering applied.
- A new command "rndc secroots" was added to dump a combined summary
  of the currently managed keys combined with statically configured
  trust anchors.
- Added support to load new keys into managed zones without signing
  immediately with "rndc loadkeys". Added support to link keys with
  "dnssec-keygen -S" and "dnssec-settime -S".
- Documentation improvements
- ORCHID prefixes were removed from the automatic empty zone list.
- Improved handling of GSSAPI security contexts. Specifically, better
  memory management of cached contexts, limited lifetime of a context
  to 1 hour, and added a "realm" command to nsupdate to allow
  selection of a non-default realm name.
- The contributed tool "ztk" was updated to version 1.0.
