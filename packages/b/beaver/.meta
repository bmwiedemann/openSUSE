  <title>Beaver is an Early AdVanced EditoR</title>
  <description>Beaver starts up fast and doesn't use a lot of memory.
Beaver's only dependency is GTK+2, so no need to install
other libraries eating your disk space. These things make
Beaver very suitable for old computers and use in small Linux distributions.</description>
