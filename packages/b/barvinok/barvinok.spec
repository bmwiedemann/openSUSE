%description devel
This is a library for computing homotopy continuation of a given root of one
dimensional sections of bivariate complex polynomials.

The output is a piecewise linear approximation of the path followed
by the root, with the property that there is a tubular neighborhood,
with square transversal section, that contains the actual path, and
there is a three times thicker tubular neighborhood guaranted to
contain no other root of the polynomial. This second property ensures
that the piecewise linear approximation computed from all roots of a
polynomial form a topologically correct deformation of the actual
braid, since the inner tubular neighborhoods cannot intersect.

This subpackage contains the include files and library links for
developing with PolyLib.
