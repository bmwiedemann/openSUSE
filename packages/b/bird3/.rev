    <comment>Main changes are under the hood, from the users perspective should be almost
the same as Bird 2. But for stable distributions (&lt;16.0) it makes sense to be
conservative and provide it as an alternative. For 16.0 and Tumbleweed it makes
sense to provide it as the main implementation.</comment>
