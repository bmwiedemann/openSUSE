- Update to version 0.16.5:
  * nogo is a new framework for running static analysis as part of
    Bazel builds. Developers can write their own analyzers which
    run alongside the compiler on each Go package. Analyzers may
    stop the build when they detect problems.
  * rules_go now uses the new cc_common module to collect C / C++
    flags. This ensures compatibility with future versions of
    Bazel, since the CROSSTOOL-related fields in CcToolchainInfo
    are being removed soon.
  * go_download_sdk now supports goos and goarch attributes. These
    may be useful for remote execution when the execution platform
    is different from the host platform.
  * Cgo now declares internal targets in each supported mode that
    influences the selection of source files and dependencies with
    build constraints.
  * Support for Go 1.11.4 and 1.10.7.
  * Several Bazel compatibility fixes and small bug fixes.
  * Exclude srcs and their runfiles from Go rule runfiles.
  * De-duplicate dependencies with the same import path.
