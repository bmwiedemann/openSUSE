  <title>Fast Anti-Spam Filtering by Bayesian Statistical Analysis</title>
  <description>Bogofilter is a Bayesian spam filter.  In normal operation, it takes an
e-mail message or text from standard input, does a statistical check
against lists of &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; words, and returns a status code
indicating whether the message is spam.  Bogofilter is designed with
fast algorithms (including the Berkeley DB system), coded directly in
C, and tuned for speed, so it can be used for production by sites that
process a lot of mail.</description>
