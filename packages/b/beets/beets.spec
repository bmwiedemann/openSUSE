%description
Beets is a media library management system for obsessive-compulsive music
geeks.

The purpose of beets is to get a music collection right once and for all.
It catalogs the collection, automatically improving its metadata as it goes.
It then provides a bouquet of tools for manipulating and accessing the music.

beets is designed as a library, has a number of plugins which
support these actions:

- Fetch or calculate all the metadata that could possibly be needed:
  album art, lyrics, genres, tempos, ReplayGain levels, or acoustic
  fingerprints.
- Get metadata from MusicBrainz, Discogs, and Beatport, or guess
  metadata using songs' filenames or their acoustic fingerprints.
- Transcode audio to any format.
- Check your library for duplicate tracks and albums or for albums that
  are missing tracks.
- Clean up crufty tags left behind by other tools.
- Embed and extract album art from files' metadata.
- Browse the music library graphically through a Web browser and play it in any
  browser that supports HTML5 Audio.
- Analyze music files' metadata from the command line.
- Listen to your library with a music player that speaks the MPD protocol
  and works with a variety of interfaces.

Writing additional plugins for beets is possible using Python.
