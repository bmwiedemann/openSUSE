NVIDIA OptiX rendering on openSUSE

Prerequisites

Given, you mastered SUSE-NVIDIA-GPU-rendering.txt already, follow this guide 
in order to have OptiX rendering available from Blender.

Note, that you need an account on https://developer.nvidia.com for the next step
to succeed.

Download the OptiX package for Linux from

https://developer.nvidia.com/designworks/optix/download

At the time of this writing, this was Version 7.4.0.
The further description refers to this version.

You need to unpack it in a specific location (as root). Since we need to specify
the path to OptiX at build time, /opt/nvidia/optix needs to point to your current
OptiX environment:

$ su
# mkdir -p /opt/nvidia
# cd /opt/nvidia
# sh ~user/Downloads/NVIDIA-OptiX-SDK-7.4.0-linux64-x86_64.sh
# # Answer all questions with yes.

# # Note: adjust path accordingly
# ln -s NVIDIA-OptiX-SDK-7.4.0-linux64-x86_64 optix

Now set up OptiX environment, e.g. in ~/.profile or in /etc/profile.local:

export OPTIX_ROOT_DIR=/opt/nvidia/optix
export OPTIX_INCLUDE_DIR=$OPTIX_ROOT_DIR/include

Given, all prerequisites are fulfilled, you should find the OptiX rendering device
in Edit -> Preferences -> System.
