  <title>bom - Deals with Unicode byte order marks</title>
  <description>bom is a simple UNIX command line utility for dealing with Unicode byte order marks (BOM's).

Unicode byte order marks are &quot;magic number&quot; byte sequences that sometimes appear at the beginning of a file to indicate the file's character encoding. They're sometimes helpful but usually they're just annoying.
