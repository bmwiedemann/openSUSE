- Update to version 0.6.1
  * Fine-grained kill signals - bottom defaulted to kill -15, but
    now, on Unix-based systems, you can directly choose which kill
    signal you want.

    instead revert to the older style with just two options.

  * Added Nord colour schemes. This can be enabled either in the
    config file or command line with color=nord or color=nord-light.

Sat Nov 28 16:27:52 UTC 2020 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 0.5.3
  * Fixes custom battery colour levels being inverted.
- Update to version 0.5.2
  * Fixes hide_avg_cpu being inverted in config files.
- Update to version 0.5.1
  * Patch for some bugs that were spotted in the 0.5.0 release.
- Update to version 0.5.0
  Features
  * Adaptive network graphs: the network widget's y-axis will now
    adjust based on your current usage.
  * Mouse support for tables and moving to widgets.
  * The ability to hide specific temperature and disk entries
    via config.
  * Added a tree mode, you can access this with the t key.
  * A simple indicator for when data updating is frozen.
  * Built-in colour themes.
  Changes
  * Updated help descriptions, added auto-complete generation.
  * Changed how we do battery theming. We now only set high,
    medium, and low colours and we deal with the ratios.
  Bug Fixes
  * Fixes a bug where you could move down in the process widget
    even if the process widget search was closed.
  * Add labels to Linux temperature values.
  * Implements sorting by count. It previously did absolutely
    nothing.
  * Fix being able to cause an index out-of-bounds by resizing to
    a smaller terminal just after the program got the terminal
    size, but right before the terminal started drawing.
  * Fixed not clearing screen before drawing, which caused issues
    for some environments.
  * Fix highlighted entries being stuck in another colour when the
    widget is not selected.
  * Expanding a widget no longer overrides the widget/dialog title
    colour.
  * Fixed process names occasionally showing up as truncated, due
    to only using /proc//stat as our data source.
  * Fixed missing thread termination steps as well as improper
    polling causing blocking in input thread.
  * Fixed the CPU basic widget showing incorrect data due to an
    incorrect offset when displaying the data.
  * Fixed an incorrect offset affecting the CPU colour when
    scrolling.
  * Fixed spacing problems in basic CPU mode.
  * Fixed an incorrect offset affecting the graph CPU colour
    mismatching the legend.
  * Removes an accidental extra comma in one of the headers in the
    disk widget.
  * Removes the automatically generated CPU colours method.

Sun Aug 30 13:10:51 UTC 2020 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 0.4.7
  * Just a single bug fix, where searching by command name was
    broken.
- Update to version 0.4.6
  * Minor update, with some bug fixes, changes, and new features.
    Most of the work done was refactoring and updating old, weird
    code.
  Features
  * Allow using P to toggle between the processes' base name and
    the processes' full name
  * Added sorting capabilities for any column. Using s will open
    up a menu allowing you to select which column you want to sort
    by.
  * Added I to invert the current process sort.
  * Added the ability to toggle between mem% and actual memory
    values by using % in the process widget:
  * Support searching processes by state (i.e. state=sleeping).
  * Added WASD as an alternative method to moving between widgets.
  * Made e also escape expanded widgets (so e expands, then
    pressing e again will shrink the widget, like if you had pressed
    ESC).
  Changes
  * Dropped MSRV (for now), mainly supporting stable and newer
    versions of Rust.
  Bug fixes
  * Fixed bug in basic mode where the battery widget was placed
    incorrectly.
  * Fixed a bug caused by hitting Enter when a process kill fails,
    breaking future process kills.
  * Fix bug caused by incorrectly reading the /proc/{pid}/stats file.
- Update to version 0.4.5
  * Minor update to match needing to update on crates.io.  No changes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul  6 06:40:34 UTC 2020 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 0.4.4
  Features
  * Added process states to the processes widget.
  Bug Fixes
  * Fixed a bug where bottom would incorrectly read the wrong
    values to calculate the read/write columns for processes
    in Linux.
  * Fixed a bug where OR operations in the process query wouldn't
    properly for some cases.
  * Improved process query overall
  Changes
  * Showing average CPU is now on by default. Disable it via flag.
  * Removed CPU filtering. I didn't like it and had planned on
    rolling out this change with an alternative, more usable CPU
    widget system. Note, if you liked it, let me know, it's easy
    to add back in as an option but for now, I ripped it out since
    it was causing more headaches.
  * show_disabled_data flag and option are also removed as they
    are now irrelevant.
  * Made the CPU entry you're scrolling over highlight even when
    you're not on the widget.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May 15 08:50:25 UTC 2020 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 0.4.3
  * Minor update to update a dependency to avoid an overflow.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May 12 19:21:43 UTC 2020 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 0.4.2
  Changes
  * Automatically hide time axis labels if the widget gets too
    small.
  * Automatically hide table gap if the widget gets too small.
  Bugs
  * The <Space> character can be used as an "AND" again (properly)
    in queries. For example:
  * Fixed an issue where if the drive I/O label didn't match any
    disk, the entire disk widget would display no results.
  * Display SWAP and MEM legends even if the total amount is 0 to
    avoid a weird blank spot in the legend.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat May  9 19:17:50 UTC 2020 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>
