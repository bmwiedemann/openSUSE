brise is deprecated since plum comes out.

the standard [plum](https://github.com/rime/plum) is developed in bash. openSUSE uses [rime-plum-go](https://github.com/marguerite/rime-plum-go).

brise in openSUSE is just a checkout of :all

    mkdir brise-0.38
    go build rime-plum-go/plum.go
    rime-plum-go/plum -d brise -b -r :all
