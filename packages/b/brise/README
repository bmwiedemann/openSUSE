brise is deprecated by plum.

the standard [plum](https://github.com/rime/plum) is developed in bash. openSUSE uses [rime-plum-go](https://github.com/marguerite/rime-plum-go). the golang version is 100% compatible with the bash version, and respects https_proxy environment variable for those behind firewall.

brise in openSUSE is just a checkout of :all

    mkdir brise
    export GO111MODULE=on
    go build rime-plum-go/plum.go
    rime-plum-go/plum -d brise -b -r :all
