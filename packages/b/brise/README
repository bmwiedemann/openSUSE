brise is deprecated by plum.

the standard [plum](https://github.com/rime/plum) is developed in bash. openSUSE uses [rime-plum-go](https://github.com/marguerite/rime-plum-go). the golang version is 100% compatible with the bash version, and respects https_proxy environment variable for those behind firewall.

brise in openSUSE is just a checkout of :all

    mkdir brise-20250315
    export GO111MODULE=on
    go build rime-plum-go
    rime_dir=brise rime_frontend=fcitx rime-plum-go/rime-plum-go :all
    tar -c brise-20250315 | zstd > brise-20250315.tar.zst
