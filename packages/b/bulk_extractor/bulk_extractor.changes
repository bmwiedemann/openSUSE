- update to v1.4.0
  * There is a long list of bug fixes and improvements, see ChangeLog and be-1.4.0-announcement.pdf in /usr/share folder
    * added support for lightgrep library which greatly improves keyword search speed
    * src/scan_accts.flex (dob): DOBs, Fedex#s, and SSNs are now recorded to a feature recorder called 'pii.txt'.
    * src/scan_net.cpp (scan_net): the -S variable carve_tcp is now implemented by the scan_net scanner to enable or disable TCP/IP memory structure carving. It is disabled by default.
    * src/scan_zip.cpp (scan_zip_component): now prints mtime in ISO8601 format
    * src/bulk_extractor.h: removed all global options; replaced with the be config system
    * src/bulk_extractor.cpp (main): -S now sets options; -s now sets sampling fraction.
    * src/bulk_extractor.cpp (usage): The -B option for specifying the blocksize for bulk data analysis has been removed. Instead specify it with -S block_size=NN.
- commented out be-1.3.1-cpuid.patch.  It is unclear how to rebase.
- rebase ppc-cpuid.patch, ppc build still broken possibly because of missing be-1.3.1-cpuid patch
- delete be-1.3.1-remove-date-time.patch
- add be-1.4.0-remove-date-time.patch  (it is in a different source file, so this is not just a rebase)
- add BuildRequires lightgrep shared library
  * This is not mandatory and could be conditioned out for architectures that don't have it
- add patch to prevent a new test program from being packaged
  * PATCH-FIX-OPENSUSE be-1.3.1-remove-debug-program [/usr/bin/plugin_test should not be installed]
- Add BuildRequires java-devel.  This allows the BEViewer to build and install
- BEViewer.jar is installing to /usr/bin.   Move it to /usr/share/bulk_extractor.
- use sed to update BEViewer to reference the jar in /usr/share/bulk_extractor, not /usr/bin
- Add BEViewer script and jar file to %files section
- Add the announcement email as a standalone PDF as documentation
- Add requires: sleuthkit so that identify_filenames.py works properly
