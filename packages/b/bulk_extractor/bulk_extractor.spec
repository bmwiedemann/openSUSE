%description
bulk_extractor is a C++ program that scans a disk image, a file, or a
directory of files and extracts useful information without parsing the
file system or file system structures. The results are stored in feature
files that can be easily inspected, parsed, or processed with automated
tools. bulk_extractor also created a histograms of features that it finds,
as features that are more common tend to be more important.
