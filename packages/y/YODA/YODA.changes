    binning in yodamerge and yodastack.
- Changes from version 2.1.0:
  * Add support for regex-based capture of AO path/name components
    with optional string substitution map.
- Changes from version 2.0.3:
  * Convert all scripts to use explicit python3 as interpreter,
    and remove defunct uses of 'from __future__ import' except in
    configure.ac where compatibility is needed to detect and
    reject Python2.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Mar 23 14:49:53 UTC 2025 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

  * Change Python build to use PY_LDFLAGS rather than
    LINKFORSHARED variable.
  * Patch BinEstimator to ensure the log version is used for log

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb 19 12:18:23 UTC 2024 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.9.10:
  * No release notes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec  6 08:09:10 UTC 2023 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.9.9:
  * Limit autotools requirement to 2.69
  * Ignore unknown sections in FLAT files (allows reading files
    generated by rivet-cmphistos)
  * Fix binary relocation in binreloc.c
  * Explicitly import base-class virtual operator= in AO classes
    to silence new GCC13 compiler warnings.

- Update to version 1.9.8:
  * Fix Cython matching of optional Booleans in ROOT conversion
    functions.
  * Introducing matplotlib based plotting: standalone Python
    scripts are generated that contain the logic to produce a
    plot. These script do not depend on YODA and should hence be
    sharable with people that have no YODA.  Python3 and
    matplotlib are required. The numerical data	associated with
    individual curves is outsourced to a {name}__data.py script to
    aide legibility.
  * Fix bug in yodamerge to handle files with inconsistent AOs
  * Add CXXFLAGS and LDFLAGS propagation to the Python-extension
  	build script.

	  native str for v2 and v3, removing extensive encode()/decode()
	  calls.
  * Add binreloc-based libPath() and dataPath() functions,
    including in Python.
- Drop YODA-correct-python-platlib.patch: fixed upstream.

  * Add Stat and Uncor to labels flagged as uncorrelated.
  * Update yaml-cpp version for C++17 compatibility.
  * Replace distutils with sysconfig and manual calls to the
    compiler.
- Add YODA-correct-python-platlib.patch: Use correct python
  platlib ($prefix/lib64) consistently across different python
  versions; although we do not build for multiple python versions,
  we would not want to adapt the file list everytime upstream
  python vacillates between lib (e.g. python 3.8/3.10) vs lib64
  (e.g. python 3.9) for platlib.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug 24 22:12:43 UTC 2022 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

  * Add per-AO double-precision writing if the
    WriterDoublePrecision annotation is set.
  * Ensure that default variation +- errors are both positive, for
    all Scatter types.  Original patch by Jon Butterworth.
  * Protect against NaNs arising from the YAML parser in
    error-breakdown calcs.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec  7 20:12:26 UTC 2021 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.9.4:
  * Fix Scatter.variations keys to be string instead of bytes in
    Python 3.
- Changes from version 1.9.3:

    correct types and error messages.
  * Fix broken reading gzipped files in Python (was a regression
    in 1.9.0)
  * Provide more options to specify the Cython command to be used.
  * Fix yAvgErr -> yErrAvg typo in Scatter2D.yErrAvgs.
  * yodascale: improved handling of .yoda.gz extensions, and
    adding --output.
  * Fix a bug with reading files while running with non-US
    locales.
  * Remove rogue s.variations() call, causing rivet-merge to crash
  * Change the Axis2D edge-uniqueness test to be based on the
    smallest bin width rather than the median.
  * Remove adoptPoint, make addPoint(Point) argument non-const
    since one should always want to update the parent of the
    point.
  * Add updateTotalUncertainty method which allows the user to
    automatically set the total error to the sum in quad of the
    error components for each point.
  * Add adoptPoint(s) methods to the Scatter*D classes, which
    allows to add a previously-instantiated point while modifying
    its parentage so that it points back to that Scatter.
  * Modify the Scatter*D copy constructor so that the parentage of
    the relevant points is correctly set, to avoid set faults
    after a Scatter*D is clone()'d.
  * Add some missing functionality which used to only be available
    to Scatter2D to also cover Scatter{1,3}D.
  * Add many additional tests to cover the ErrorBreakdown
    functionality in existing pytest scripts
  * Bin2D: use fuzzyEquals for bin edge comparisons. Required for
    correct rivet-merge behaviour with 2D histograms.

  * Add fillDim() methods to the Bin, Bin1D and Bin2D classes.
  * Rename the Point getParentAO etc. to getParent, using the new
    Scatter base, and improve the accessor methods.
  * Add Scatter base class to the Scatter classes, with rmPoints()
    implemented there.
  * Add Binned and Fillable base classes, the former introducing
    the fillDim() method and rmBin(), and use them as ABCs for the
    counter, histo and profile types.
  * Allow YODA's Python interface to read from StringIO and FileIO
    objects.
  * Add rmPoint() and rmPoints() methods on all Scatter types.
  * Change scaleDim() to scale() for points and scatters
  * Remove ROOT5 compatibility, and handle 6.22 change in PyROOT.
  * Fix out-of-source builds re. bash completions.

  * Add <limits> header include to AnalysisObject.h to support
    GCC11 (cf. http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-11/porting_to.html)
  * Restructure yodamerge to use pairwise merges, avoiding
    simultaneous loading of all the input files and greatly
    speeding up processing. Simultaneous simplification by
    replacement of yodamerge stacking functionality with
    yodastack.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

    `Histo2D::addBins()` C++ method instead of `Histo2D::addBin()`
    for better performance.
  * Make the low stats error for variances strictly require Neff >
    1, rather than a fuzzy comparison that can cause trouble
    downstream.
  * Make xyMids,Foci,Errs,Mins,Maxs etc. runtime configurable with
    'unique' and 'asgrid' optional params.
  * Convert geometric axis-property array functions on Histo2D and
    Profile2D to return the unique edges, mins, maxes, mids, etc.
    rather than the heavily repeated versions for all the bins.

  * Final conversion to use ast module not just in autotype but as
    first choice in AO.annotation.
  * Remove ALL uses of @property in the Python interfaces: all
    methods must have call-parentheses now.
  * Improve Python annotation parsing to preferentially use ast
    rather than yaml.

- Update to version 1.3.0:
  + Use numEntries() rather than effNumEntries() when checking
    consistency of inputs to efficiency() calculations -- the

- Update to version 1.1.0:
  + YODA 1.1.0 release.
  + Adding unit tests against ref data for yodamerge in make check.
  + Removing 'foreach' macro definition and using raw
    BOOST_FOREACH instead until C++11 is allowed.
  + Adding pytest-p1d and pytest-p2d tests, and FLAT
    writing/reading in pytests.
  + Tweaking WriterFLAT and adding ReaderFLAT functionality for 2D
    histos and profiles.
  + Some basic (FLAT) write-out capability for 2D histos
  + Improvements to the yodahist script, including support for 2D
    histograms and input files.
  + Adding bin edges constructors for all 1D and 2D histos in
    Python.
  + Improvements to Profile2D and Point2D interfaces in Python.
  + Add a single-file at a time yodacnv multi-format converter
    script (thanks to Andrii Verbytskyi for the suggestion).
  + Typo fixes in Profile2D YODA-format parsing: 2D histo tests
    now pass!
  + Adding Python tests for Histo2D and Profile2D.
  + Adding a YODA/Predicates.h header and using it in Axis2D bin
    edge construction.
  + Enabling Profile2D writing in various Writers, and a bit of IO
    code tidying.
  + Disable writing out of Histo2D and Profile2D outflows for now,
    while they are redesigned, and get 2D I/O working for the
    in-range part.
  + Mapping the divide and efficiency functions into the Python
    interface as class methods, including the __div__ special
    function.
  + Add the AnalysisObject::type() method back in Python (even
    though type(ao) is more Pythonic, this may be useful)
  + Add Profile2D YODA format writing, note need for Scatter
    format change, add sumXY storage to both 2D histo types.
  + Adding YODA reader functionality for Histo2D and Profile2D,
    but without outflows support yet.
  + Adding simple command line yodahist script for quick 1D
    histogramming from plain text files, with weight support. More
    development to come!
  + Mapping linspace, logspace and a few stat functions into
    Python.
  + Fixes, script installation, and detailed numerical comparisons
    in yodadiff.
  + Change AnalysisObject::annotations to return the list of
    annotation keys rather than the map, since the previous
    behaviour mapped very badly into Python.
  + Add special case handling for 2-arg use of x2y scripts where
    the second arg is -, for stdin. This will be treated as
    writing out to stdout, not converting two files one of which
    is stdin.
  + Adding a more portable version of getline to be used in the
    YODA file parsing to avoid falling over on DOS-produced input
    files.
  + Adding the namespace protection workaround for Boost described
    at http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_55_0/doc/html/foreach.html
  + Adding an assumed-equal-run-size, ratio-like merging heuristic
    for Scatter2Ds to yodamerge, and renaming the --normalize-all
    flag to --assume-normalized.
  + Adding and installing a pkg-config data file for YODA.
  + Rationalising (and fixing?) the yodamerge logic re. user &
    normalization scalings, and making way for a Scatter2D merging
    heuristic
- Packaging changes:
  + Package new binaries yodacnv, yodadiff, yodahist
  + Package new pkgconfig file (buildrequires pkg-config).
