%description
YODA is a small set of data analysis (specifically histogramming)
classes being developed by MCnet members as a lightweight common
system for MC event generator validation analyses.

A few key features of YODA are as follows:
* Storage of all information needed for statistically correct run
  combination and reweighting up to second-order correlations (e.g.
  variances, std devs, etc.) not just in the number of entries in a
  bin, but also the correlations of that with the x and y fill
  values.
* Separation of statistics and data handling from presentation. YODA
  is primarily a library for doing the data part correctly: while we
  love really high quality data presentation, that's a separate goal.
* A sensible class hierarchy for histogramming, recognising that a
  histogram contains details of fill history beyond the pure visual
  height of a bin, and that just counting weights, or binning
  arbitrary types on an axis are valuable operations.
* Flexible data format support, including a new text-based, compact,
  and human-readable YODA format.
* Proper and convenience treatment of "details" like irregular bin
  widths, gaps in contiguous binning, and overflows/underflows/etc.
  (incuding how they impact normalisation and calculation of histo-
  wide stat quantities)
* Carefully designed programming interfaces in C++ and Python. We
  are very welcoming of feedback and design evolution, too!
