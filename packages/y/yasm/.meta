  <title>A complete rewrite of the NASM assembler</title>
  <description>YASM is a complete rewrite of the NASM assembler. It is designed from
the ground up to allow for multiple syntaxes to be supported (e.g.,
NASM, TASM, GAS, etc.) in addition to multiple output object formats.
Another primary module of the overall design is an optimizer module.
Actually it supports ix86 and AMD64, next will be PowerPC</description>
