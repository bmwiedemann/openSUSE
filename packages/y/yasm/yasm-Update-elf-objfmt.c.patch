Subject: [PATCH] Update elf-objfmt.c

tl;dnr: add support for note.gnu.property note sections.

ceph has a few optimized crc32 routines hand written in assembly in yasm format. (Nobody appears to have the stomach for rewriting them in another format.)  Fedora requires that libraries be CET enabled. IOW all .o comprising a shared library need a note.gnu.properties NOTE section with some magic bits that tell the linker that the .o was compiled with the appropriate options.

I can add such a note section, but without this change yasm will not set the correct section flag and I have to resort to some dd magic to set the correct section type before linking all the .o files into the shlib.
