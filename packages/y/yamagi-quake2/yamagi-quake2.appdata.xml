    <p>
      Yamagi Quake II is an enhanced client for id Software's Quake II. The
      main focus is an unchanged single player experience; the gameplay and
      graphics are unaltered. It also features: anisotropic filtering and
      multi-sample anti-aliasing, widescreen aspect ratio and unlimited
      screen size, compatibility with most mods, optional support for
      retexturing packs and HUD scaling.
