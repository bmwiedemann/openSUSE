Sun May 26 15:03:51 UTC 2019 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 7.41
  * Some bugfixes to HTTP downloads introduced in 7.40.
  * Fix several crashes when loading savegames in coop.
  * Fix some out of memory aborts when loading maps with a lot
    surfaces.
  * Allow autodetection of the desktop resolution. Set 'r_mode' to
    '-2' to enable that.
  * Several fixes to the OpenGL 3.2 renderer. Some dynamic lights
    were missing, for example for most explosions. Stencil shadows
    were broken under some conditions. Intel Ivy Bridge didn't work.
    Under some conditions lights were too bright.
  * Add an optional fix for lighting problems in maps that misuse
    sky surfaces for interior lighting. Set 'gl_fixsurfsky' to '1'
    to enable it.
  * Another bunch of timing fixes. The game should now hold the
    framerate under all conditions.

- Update to version 7.40
  * Add support for HTTP downloads. Both the r1q2 and q2pro URL schemes
    are supported, if a file is unavailable over HTTP the download code
    falls back to UDP.
  * Savegames can be removed through the menu by pressing 'del' on the
    selected savegame.
  * Support external entity files.
  * Some fixes to OGG/Vorbis music playback. The music keeps playing after
    s_restart and ogg_shuffle is handled correctly by the menu.
  * Another round of timing fixes. Average frame times are now taken into
    account when taking an educated guess on the next frames render time.
    And the display refresh rate detection no longer cripple working GPU
    drivers in an efford to work around bugs in older version of AMDs.
  * A lot of fixes to the internal memory management. The game is now
    much more memory efficient, this allows playing of extremly big maps
    without crashes. This is largly based upon work done by Denis Pauk.
  * New and much more detailed documentation.
  * Enhancements to the software renderer. Retexturing packs are now
    supported, general cleanup and bugfixes.

Tue Oct  2 12:34:36 UTC 2018 - mardnh@gmx.de

- Update to version 7.30
  + Removed support for SDL 1.2.
  + Removed static dependencies to libogg, libvorbis and libz.
  + Fixed several bugs regarding render- and fullscreen switch.
  + A lot of fixes and improvements to the software renderer. It's now
    able to render the whole game without artifacts and much faster than
    before.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jul 14 18:19:50 UTC 2018 - mardnh@gmx.de

- Update to version 7.21
  + Fix some render glitches in the software renderer. (by Denis Pauk)
  + Render the weapon independent of the current field of view, otherwise
    the weapon distorts with very high FOV settings. The weapons FOV can
    be set through r_gunfov, it defaults to 90.
  + Rework the OGG/Vorbis backend. This fixes several annoying bugs, and
    adds support for alternative track <=> file mappings. Use this to
    implement support for the audio tracks supplied by the GOG.com version
    of Quake II.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Mar 11 08:54:22 UTC 2018 - mardnh@gmx.de

- Update to version 7.20
  + Add the soft renderer back. This feature is considered experimental.
    The porting of the old soft renderer code to SDL and it's cleanup
    were done by Denis Pauk.
  + Rename several cvars to be consistent across different renderers.
    The configuration file will be converted at the first start, when an
    old cvar name is used a message is printed.
  + Make the client unicode compatible. Yamagi Quake II can now be 
    installed into pathes with unicode characters in it. On Windows the
    user name of the current account may contain unicode characters.
    As a side effect the game can run on ReFS volumes. While '+set
    basedir' is still supported, the unicode compatible '-datadir'
    should be used.
  + Another round of timing fixes. The game is now capable of holding
    the requestes or vsync framerate even on slow machines and with
    problematic GL drivers.
  + Fix server side mod handling, their configs are now saved to the
    correct directories and the configs are reexeced at mod startup.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Dec 10 09:45:13 UTC 2017 - mardnh@gmx.de

- Update to version 7.10
  + Joystick support including haptic feedback. This fantastic work was
    done by Denis Pauk. The dirty work is done by SDL, how good or bad
    a joystick or gamepad is supported depends on SDLs support for it.
  + Fix the old SDL sound backend, s_openal set to 0 is working again.
  + Fix possible Vorbis buffer underruns if too many sound samples are
    in flight. This occured only in large multi player games with at
    least 6 custom models.
  + Fix a possible crash on Windows if MSAA was set to a value not
    supported by the driver.
  + It's now possible to play through the whole game on a Raspberry PI
    and other ARM boards. Please note that the RPIs hardware is really
    limited. Only the OpenGL 1.4 renderer is supported and the framerate
    is highly dependend on the screen resolution.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Oct  1 17:01:51 UTC 2017 - mardnh@gmx.de

- Update to version 7.0.2
  + Fix several corner cases regarding render library loading. The game
    should now always fall back to the OpenGL 1.4 renderer if the new
    OpenGL 3.2 renderer can't be initialized. Also the game aborts if no
    useable OpenGL implementation exists.
  + Refactor the search path code. This should fix several bugs with
    Quake II writing to the wrong directories or being unable to find
    some / all assets.
  + Reimplement portable binaries. If called with the -portable command
    line option Quake II saves all data (configs, savegames, screenshorts
    etc.) into it's systemwide installation directory and not users home
    directory. In contrast to the old implementation on Windows stdout.txt
    contains all output, the first lines are no longer missing.
  + vid_fullscreen set to 1 now keeps the desktops resolution. Set it to 2
    to change the resolution.
  + Instead of a list with precalculated FOV values the video menu now
    shows a slider with possible values from 60 to 120. Horplus is now
    always enabled, set the horplus cvar to 0 to disable it.
  + The game is now able to hold the requested framerate (either by the
    vsync or the gl_maxfps cvar) with an accuracy of about +/- 1% as long
    as the hardware is fast enough.  The framecounter was reimplemented
    to be much more precise.
  + Fix misspredictions if an original client running on Win32 connects
    to a Yamagi Quake II server running on Linux/i386.
- Remove patch:
  + yamagi-quake2-fix-OpenGL-linking.diff (fixed upstream)

- fix reproducible builds again

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun  9 13:43:49 UTC 2017 - mardnh@gmx.de

- Update to version 7.0.0
  + Remove the broken multitexturing render path from the OpenGL 1.4
    renderer. It was switched off by default in 6.00.
  + Reimplement the support for shared renderer libraries. Please note
    the this is an incompatible implementation with an custom API. The
    original renderer libraries will not work!
  + Implement an OpenGL 3.2 renderer. This renderer has the same look
    and feel as the old OpenGL 1.4 renderer but makes heavy use of
    modern OpenGL and GPU features. An OpenGL 3.2 capable GPU (Intel
    starting with Ivy Bridge on Windows or Sandy Bridge on Linux, Nvidia
    staring with G80 and AMD starting with R600 / HD2000) is required.
  + Fix OpenAL compatibility with modern openal-soft versions.
  + Several fixes and optimizations to OpenAL, implement support for
    doppler effects. (by xorw)
- Add patch:
  + yamagi-quake2-fix-OpenGL-linking.diff

- Add appdata.xml

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Dec 16 05:15:37 UTC 2016 - luke.nukem.jones@gmail.com

Update to version 6.00

- Make the client asynchronous. The old behaviour can be forced by
  setting cl_async to 0. Please note that asynchronicity can lead
  to problems if the old SDL 1.2 backend is used and vsync is
  enabled.
- Implement gl_overbrightbits in the non multitexturing case.  A
  value of 1 just fixes lighting on water surfaces, higher values
  increase the brightness of everything.
- General renderer overhaul for better compatibility with modern GPU
  OpenGL 1.4 is now required, older versions are no longer supported.
  Multitexturing was deprecated and will be removed in a future
  release.
- Fix some longstanding AI problems.
- Several general gameplay fixes.

- patch allow-custom-cflags.patch has been removed due to the
  package being forked in factory
