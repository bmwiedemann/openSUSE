Wed Apr  2 18:43:59 UTC 2025 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 8.50
  * Consistent bindings between multiple gamepad types.
  * Improved menu navigation with gamepads.
  * The SDL 3 code now supports the stable SDL 3 API. Several bugs
     with SDL 3 were fixed.
  * Water warp effect for the OpenGL 1.4 renderer.
  * Add a sound backend selector to the menu.
  * Fix several problems with HTTP downloads.
  * Better navigation in input fields in the menu. Support left and
     right navigation, add support for the ctrl-l,c,x,v shortcuts.
  * Performance optimizations for the OpenGL 1.4 renderer,
    especially on embedded and mobile GPUs. Includes an alternative
    GL ES 1.0 renderer.
  * Several fixes to gl1_stereo.
  * Fix the SDL2 sound backend not working with modern backends.
  * Make the Windows key bindable.
  * Support true randomness when shuffling audio tracks.
  * Fix leaking temporary spawnflags into entities spawned
    mid-level.
  * Support the unofficial GL4 renderer lib in the video menu.
  * Clipboard support for the console and better navigation in the
    console line editor.
  * Support player models inside pak files in the menu.
  * Support 24 bit PCX files.
  * Check if an entity file matches the current map before loading
    it. This fixes problems with loading entity files from Quake II
    against Quake II Remaster maps and the other way round.
- Build with support for SDL3 on TW

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jan 26 10:45:57 UTC 2025 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 8.41
  * Fix an endless loop in the OpenGL 1.4 renderer crashing the
    game and blocking further progress under some circumstances.
  * Don't force a platform dependend, hard coded SDL audio driver,
    let SDL choose the driver instead. This may fix the SDL audio
    backend on some platforms. The driver can still be overridden
    by setting `s_sdldriver` to something else than `auto`.
    Under Windows `s_sdldriver` defaults `directsound` because
    `auto` may choose an incompatible driver.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jul 27 17:10:23 UTC 2024 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 8.40
  * Implement `g_quick_weap`. If set to 1, both weapprev and
    weapnext commands will count how many times they have been
    called, making possible to skip weapons by quickly tapping one
    of these keys.
  * Fix `gl1_overbrightbits`, allowed values are now 0, 1, 2 and 4.
  * Sort player skins case insensitive.
  * Implement `cl_showspeed` to show the current player speed.
  * Add texture filtering options to the video menu.
  * Implement `cl_laseralpha` to control how transparent laser
    beams are.
  * Experimental support for SDL 3. Requires SDL 3.1.2.
  * Reimplement multitexturing for the OpenGL 1.4 renderer.
    Controlled by `gl1_multitexture`, enabled by default.
  * Optimize dynamic lights and texture allocation in the
    OpenGL 1.4 renderer.
  * Implement gyro tightening for gamepads and joysticks.
  * Support long player skin names.
  - Add a very simple download filter. Files ending in .dll,
    .dylib and .so are always filtered to prevent code injection.
  * Don't load OpenAL and cURL libraries if thy are configured
    with a full or relative path.
  * Work around naggy help icons.
  * Group draw call in GL1. This yields huge performance gains on
    slow GPUs.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb 20 13:02:58 UTC 2024 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Use %autosetup macro. Allows to eliminate the usage of deprecated
  %patchN

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Dec  3 20:44:33 UTC 2023 - Dirk MÃ¼ller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 8.30:
  * Use the same model loading code in all renderers.
  * Remove the unused `msg` cvar and the corresponding server
    side infrastructure. The cvar was never implemented in Quake II,
    but existing bits could be used for attacks against the client.
  * Add `cl_audiopaused`. When set to `1` the audio stops when
    the game is paused.
  * Add `ogg_pausewithgame`. When set to `1` the background music
    stops when the game is paused. (by apartfromtime)
  * New logo files, matching the original Quake II logo.
  * Support for RISCV64 (by David Carlier)
  * Fix resetting Mods back to baseq2 when running with
    `-portable`.
  * Alternative playback modes for OGG/Vorbis background music:
    once, sequential, random. (by apartfromtime)
  * Support gyro aiming for Switch controllers with SDL < 2.0.14.
    (by protocultor)
  * Fixed stand-ground gladiators not attacking within a certain
    range.
  * Fixed monsters seeing players during intermissions.
  * Several fixes to Makron. (by BjossiAlfreds)
  * Optional high dpi awareness when running under Wayland.
    Requires a Wayland compositor supporting fractional-scale-v1
    and at least SDL 2.26. Set `vid_highdpiawareness 1` to enable.
  * Fix lava surfaces not glowing.
  * Add a cheat protected cvar `g_swap_speed`. Allows to skip
    frames of "putting down weapon" and "raising weapon" animations,
    speeding them up.
  * Support of RGBA png/jpg image with r_retexturing as
    cinematic.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Dec 10 19:55:57 UTC 2022 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 8.20
  - Various improvements to the menu. This includes updates to the
    menu framework itself, to the game controller menu, the
    savegame menu and the video menus.
    0lvin)
  - A lot of fixes and improvements to the controller support.
    Support for gyro aiming, more precise stick handling and rumble
    improvements.
  - Implement faster weapon switching with the new 'cycleweap'
    command.
  - Fixes pusher delta yaw manipulation. This fixes the infamous
    bug were a player standing on a blocked elevator gets turned
    around
  - Add a command 'spawnentity' to spawn entities at the given
    coordinates. Can be used for debugging.
  - Ported monster footstep sounds from SkacikPLs Q2RTX fork. Needs
    a pak file with assets to work, see the documentation for
    details.
  - Ported reverb effects from SkacikPLs Q2RTX fork.
  - Fix several coop related bugs with the powercubes.
  - A way better fix for dead bodys obstructing elevators or
    falling through the worldmodel.
  - Fix items already in water playing a splash sound at level
    start.
  - Pause the game when getting minimized or hidden.
  - Fix Bugs related to 'ogg_ignoretrack0'.
  - Share model loading code between renderers.
  - Restore stair step smoothing for step sizes other than 16.
  - Fix playback of long audio samples (>10 seconds) through
    OpenAL.

- BuildRequre sdl2 stuff via pkgconfig(*).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun May 29 13:20:53 UTC 2022 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 8.10
  * The OpenGL 3.2 renderer now supports the classic underwater
    effect.  Until now it was only available in the Software
    renderer.
  * Add 'ref_gles3', an OpenGL ES 3.0 renderer lib. This is an
    variant of the OpenGL 3.2 renderer, using OpenGL ES instead of
    desktop OpenGL.  It greatly enhances support for embedded GPUs
    like the RaspberryPI 4.
  * The Software renderer now supports colored lightning. It can
    be enabled through `sw_colorlight`.
  * Another round of timing fixes. Implement `cl_maxfps -1` (the
    new default, existing configs are not altered) to
    automatically select a known to be good packet framerate
    depending on the current renderer framerate. This solves some
    subtile problems with stuttering entities.
  * Greatly improved support for joysticks and controllers. Devices
    can now be hotplugged at runtime, binding should be portable
    between differend controllers and there's a new menu for
    controller bindings.
  * Add the `r_2D_unfiltered` and `r_videos_unfiltered` cvars. When
    enabled 2D elements like the HUD and videos are not filtered,
    they appear pixeled.
  * Add 'prefweap' command to select weapon by priority.
  * Several game code fixes, mostly for stuck mechanics in fact2.
  * Fix two stuck monsters in hangar1 and jail5.
  * Fix the `viewsize` cvar.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jan 23 22:18:33 UTC 2022 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 8.01
  * Fix the game not starting when nonexistent dirs in the search
    path.
  - Sync haptic joystick effects to the sound.
  - Move several map bug fixes to entity files, add some more map
    bug fixes. Without entity files the maps are the same as in
    Vanilla Quake II.
  - Play the correct demo loop after changing the current mod.
  - `g_footsteps 2` now only generate footstep sound when the
    player is on the ground entity and no longer when in water or
    air.
  - Add a cvar `g_machinegun_norecoil' which disables the
    machinegun recoil effect. This is cheat protected.
  - Scale 8 bit textures when `r_scale8bittextures` is set.
  - The game is no longer limited to 1000 FPS when running in
    timedemo mode.
  - Optimise command line parser and fix several subtle bugs.
  - Add `r_2D_unfiltered`, when set to `1` 2D elements aren't
    filtered.
  - Fix soldiers never chowing their pain skin as long as they're
    alive.
  - Fix relative paths in ZIP files not being found.
  - Add `gamemode` command for changing between singleplayer,
    deathmach and coop.
  - Show a download progress bar when `cl_http_show_dw_progress`
    is set to `1`.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Aug 22 12:28:26 UTC 2021 - Imo Hester <vortex@z-ray.de>

- patched systemwide support (systemwide.patch)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun 14 16:00:04 UTC 2021 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 8.00
  * Client side support for the optional Vulkan renderer library.
  * Non existent renderer libraries are now skipped over by the
    menu.
  * Fix several bugs when loading autosaves.
  * Bump the maximal number of OGG/Vorbis files to 128.
  * Several fixes to the Barracuda Shark.
  * 'vid_fullscreen' and 'r_mode' are no longer special, they
    require an explicit 'vid_restart' like every other cvar.
  * Remove hardcoded map fixes and replace them by optional entity
    files.  Add several newly discovered map fixes.
  * Send the network protocol version to the server. This can be
    used by the server to support clients with different network
    protocol version.
  * Switch the semantics of the 'vid_fullscreen' cvar. '1' is now
    native fullscreen, like it was in Vanilla Quake II. '2' is
    desktop fullscreen. When desktop fullscreen is selected through
    the menu, 'r_mode' is forced to '-2'.
  * Add 'g_footsteps' to control the generation of footstep sound.
    This cvar is cheat protected. '1' is Vanilla Quake II behavior
    and the default. '0' never generates footstep sound, '2' always
    generates them.
  * Support stereo wave files.
  * Add 'cl_r1q2_lighstyle'. When set to '1' Yamagi Quake II uses
    the Vanilla Quake II light styles (for example yellow light for
    the Hyperblaster) instead of the default r1q2 light styles.
  * Add a submenu to configure gamepad and joystick sensitivities.
  * Ensure that the config file is written before changing the
    active mod.  This prevents config changes from getting lost.
  * Overhaul the search path logic. Make sure that each directory
    is added only once.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Feb 28 18:51:38 UTC 2021 - Dirk MÃ¼ller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 7.45:
  * Fix some input option not getting saved.
  * Limit busywaits to the full client. This lowers the cpu consumption of
    q2ded considerably.
  * Rework the build system to be more distribution friendly.
  * Fix some corner cases of broken IPv6 connectivity.
  * Fix qport colliding between several Yamagi Quake II clients.
  * Keyboard keys unknown to Yamagi Quake II can now be bound.
  * Adaptive vsync is now supported by setting r_vsync to 1.
  * Implement coop_pickup_weapons. When set to 1, a weapon may be picked up by
    coop players if the player doesn`t have the weapon in their inventory or no
    other player has already picked it up.
  * In coop elevators wait for coop_elevator_delay seconds.
  * If cl_anglekick is set 1 angle kicks are ignored. This breaks the gameplay
    a little bit, but helps against motion sickness. This cvar is cheat
    protected.
  * Add listmaps command and autocompletion for maps. (by JBerg)
  * Make wait in scripts wait for 17 ms. This fixes some movement makros.
  * Support for Haiku. (by David Carlier)
  * Add a mods submenu. (by earth-metal)
  * Add the vstr command and nextdemo cvar. Ported from ioquake3. (by Denis Pauk)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct 16 20:49:03 UTC 2020 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 7.44
  * Fix some input option not getting saved.
  * Limit busywaits to the full client. This lowers the cpu
    consumption of q2ded considerably.
  * Rework the build system to be more distribution friendly.
    The base CFLAGS and LDFLAGS can now be overridden by the
    environment and by options passed to make.
  * Fix some corner cases of broken IPv6 connectivity.
  * Fix qport colliding between several Yamagi Quake II clients.
  * Keyboard keys unknown to Yamagi Quake II can now be bound.
  * Adaptive vsync is now supported by setting 'r_vsync' to '1'.
  * Implement 'coop_pickup_weapons'. When set to '1', a weapon may
    be picked up by coop players if the player doesn't have the
    weapon in their inventory or no other player has already picked
    it up.
  * In coop elevators wait for 'coop_elevator_delay' seconds.
  * If 'cl_anglekick' is set '1' angle kicks are ignored. This
    breaks the gameplay a little bit, but helps against motion
    sickness. This cvar is cheat protected.
  * Add 'listmaps' command and autocompletion for maps.
  * Make 'wait' in scripts wait for 17 ms. This fixes some movement
    makros.
  * Add a 'mods' submenu.
  * Add the 'vstr' command and 'nextdemo' cvar.
- Drop legacy ifdefs

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb 26 11:59:54 UTC 2020 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 7.43
  * Recover from a lost sound device, do not crash of no sound
    device is available. This fixes several problem with
    DisplayPort and HDMI audio.
  * Several small game logic fixes. This includes a fix for a
    potential progress blocker in 'The Torture Chambers' introduced
    in the last release.
  * Add the 'gl1_particle_square' cvar, it forces square particles
    in the GL1 renderer.
  * The software renderer is no longer experimental.
  * Add an option to configure the gun Z offset in the software
    renderer.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Dec  1 09:10:29 UTC 2019 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 7.42
  * The console can now be scrolled with the mouse wheel.
  * Fix entities on non-horizontal surfaces rendered in full black.
  * Add an option to choose the display Quake II runs on.
  * Add an option to specify the display refresh rate used in
    fullscreen.
  * Allow mouse 'sensitivity' to be set to non-integral values.
  * Port cvar operations from q2pro. These allow the manipulation of
    cvar values, supported are: dec, inc, reset, resetall and toggle
  * Put the client into pause mode during savegame load. This
    prevents the world getting forwarded about 100 frames during
    load, time in which the player might be hurt by monsters or the
    environment.
  * New commands:
    + 'listentities' allows listing of entities.
    + 'teleport' teleports the player to the given coordinates.
  * Fix loading of config files not ending in newlines.
  * A lot of fixes for subtle, long standing AI and game play bugs.
  * Quicksaves can now be loaded and saved throught the savegame
    menus.
  * The software renderer now skips frames with no changes. This
    improves performance quite a bit, especially on slow CPUs.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun May 26 15:03:51 UTC 2019 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 7.41
  * Some bugfixes to HTTP downloads introduced in 7.40.
  * Fix several crashes when loading savegames in coop.
  * Fix some out of memory aborts when loading maps with a lot
    surfaces.
  * Allow autodetection of the desktop resolution. Set 'r_mode' to
    '-2' to enable that.
  * Several fixes to the OpenGL 3.2 renderer. Some dynamic lights
    were missing, for example for most explosions. Stencil shadows
    were broken under some conditions. Intel Ivy Bridge didn't work.
    Under some conditions lights were too bright.
  * Add an optional fix for lighting problems in maps that misuse
    sky surfaces for interior lighting. Set 'gl_fixsurfsky' to '1'
    to enable it.
  * Another bunch of timing fixes. The game should now hold the
    framerate under all conditions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb  7 21:19:42 UTC 2019 - mardnh@gmx.de

- Update to version 7.40
  * Add support for HTTP downloads. Both the r1q2 and q2pro URL schemes
    are supported, if a file is unavailable over HTTP the download code
    falls back to UDP.
  * Savegames can be removed through the menu by pressing 'del' on the
    selected savegame.
  * Support external entity files.
  * Some fixes to OGG/Vorbis music playback. The music keeps playing after
    s_restart and ogg_shuffle is handled correctly by the menu.
  * Another round of timing fixes. Average frame times are now taken into
    account when taking an educated guess on the next frames render time.
    And the display refresh rate detection no longer cripple working GPU
    drivers in an efford to work around bugs in older version of AMDs.
  * A lot of fixes to the internal memory management. The game is now
    much more memory efficient, this allows playing of extremly big maps
    without crashes. This is largly based upon work done by Denis Pauk.
  * New and much more detailed documentation.
  * Enhancements to the software renderer. Retexturing packs are now
    supported, general cleanup and bugfixes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct  2 12:34:36 UTC 2018 - mardnh@gmx.de

- Update to version 7.30
  + Removed support for SDL 1.2.
  + Removed static dependencies to libogg, libvorbis and libz.
  + Fixed several bugs regarding render- and fullscreen switch.
  + A lot of fixes and improvements to the software renderer. It's now
    able to render the whole game without artifacts and much faster than
    before.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jul 14 18:19:50 UTC 2018 - mardnh@gmx.de

- Update to version 7.21
  + Fix some render glitches in the software renderer. (by Denis Pauk)
  + Render the weapon independent of the current field of view, otherwise
    the weapon distorts with very high FOV settings. The weapons FOV can
    be set through r_gunfov, it defaults to 90.
  + Rework the OGG/Vorbis backend. This fixes several annoying bugs, and
    adds support for alternative track <=> file mappings. Use this to
    implement support for the audio tracks supplied by the GOG.com version
    of Quake II.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Mar 11 08:54:22 UTC 2018 - mardnh@gmx.de

- Update to version 7.20
  + Add the soft renderer back. This feature is considered experimental.
    The porting of the old soft renderer code to SDL and it's cleanup
    were done by Denis Pauk.
  + Rename several cvars to be consistent across different renderers.
    The configuration file will be converted at the first start, when an
    old cvar name is used a message is printed.
  + Make the client unicode compatible. Yamagi Quake II can now be
    installed into pathes with unicode characters in it. On Windows the
    user name of the current account may contain unicode characters.
    As a side effect the game can run on ReFS volumes. While '+set
    basedir' is still supported, the unicode compatible '-datadir'
    should be used.
  + Another round of timing fixes. The game is now capable of holding
    the requestes or vsync framerate even on slow machines and with
    problematic GL drivers.
  + Fix server side mod handling, their configs are now saved to the
    correct directories and the configs are reexeced at mod startup.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Dec 10 09:45:13 UTC 2017 - mardnh@gmx.de

- Update to version 7.10
  + Joystick support including haptic feedback. This fantastic work was
    done by Denis Pauk. The dirty work is done by SDL, how good or bad
    a joystick or gamepad is supported depends on SDLs support for it.
  + Fix the old SDL sound backend, s_openal set to 0 is working again.
  + Fix possible Vorbis buffer underruns if too many sound samples are
    in flight. This occured only in large multi player games with at
    least 6 custom models.
  + Fix a possible crash on Windows if MSAA was set to a value not
    supported by the driver.
  + It's now possible to play through the whole game on a Raspberry PI
    and other ARM boards. Please note that the RPIs hardware is really
    limited. Only the OpenGL 1.4 renderer is supported and the framerate
    is highly dependend on the screen resolution.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Oct  1 17:01:51 UTC 2017 - mardnh@gmx.de

- Update to version 7.0.2
  + Fix several corner cases regarding render library loading. The game
    should now always fall back to the OpenGL 1.4 renderer if the new
    OpenGL 3.2 renderer can't be initialized. Also the game aborts if no
    useable OpenGL implementation exists.
  + Refactor the search path code. This should fix several bugs with
    Quake II writing to the wrong directories or being unable to find
    some / all assets.
  + Reimplement portable binaries. If called with the -portable command
    line option Quake II saves all data (configs, savegames, screenshorts
    etc.) into it's systemwide installation directory and not users home
    directory. In contrast to the old implementation on Windows stdout.txt
    contains all output, the first lines are no longer missing.
  + vid_fullscreen set to 1 now keeps the desktops resolution. Set it to 2
    to change the resolution.
  + Instead of a list with precalculated FOV values the video menu now
    shows a slider with possible values from 60 to 120. Horplus is now
    always enabled, set the horplus cvar to 0 to disable it.
  + The game is now able to hold the requested framerate (either by the
    vsync or the gl_maxfps cvar) with an accuracy of about +/- 1% as long
    as the hardware is fast enough.  The framecounter was reimplemented
    to be much more precise.
  + Fix misspredictions if an original client running on Win32 connects
    to a Yamagi Quake II server running on Linux/i386.
- Remove patch:
  + yamagi-quake2-fix-OpenGL-linking.diff (fixed upstream)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun  9 13:43:49 UTC 2017 - mardnh@gmx.de

- Update to version 7.0.0
  + Remove the broken multitexturing render path from the OpenGL 1.4
    renderer. It was switched off by default in 6.00.
  + Reimplement the support for shared renderer libraries. Please note
    the this is an incompatible implementation with an custom API. The
    original renderer libraries will not work!
  + Implement an OpenGL 3.2 renderer. This renderer has the same look
    and feel as the old OpenGL 1.4 renderer but makes heavy use of
    modern OpenGL and GPU features. An OpenGL 3.2 capable GPU (Intel
    starting with Ivy Bridge on Windows or Sandy Bridge on Linux, Nvidia
    staring with G80 and AMD starting with R600 / HD2000) is required.
  + Fix OpenAL compatibility with modern openal-soft versions.
  + Several fixes and optimizations to OpenAL, implement support for
    doppler effects. (by xorw)
- Add patch:

Fri Dec 16 05:15:37 UTC 2016 - luke.nukem.jones@gmail.com

Update to version 6.00

- Make the client asynchronous. The old behaviour can be forced by
  setting cl_async to 0. Please note that asynchronicity can lead
  to problems if the old SDL 1.2 backend is used and vsync is
  enabled.
- Implement gl_overbrightbits in the non multitexturing case.  A
  value of 1 just fixes lighting on water surfaces, higher values
  increase the brightness of everything.
- General renderer overhaul for better compatibility with modern GPU
  OpenGL 1.4 is now required, older versions are no longer supported.
  Multitexturing was deprecated and will be removed in a future
  release.
- Fix some longstanding AI problems.
- Several general gameplay fixes.
