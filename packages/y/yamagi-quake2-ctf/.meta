  <title>Quake II - Three Wave Capture The Flag for yamagi-quake2</title>
  <description>Yamagi Quake II is an enhanced client for id Software's Quake II. The main
focus is an unchanged single player experience like back in 1997, thus the
gameplay and the graphics are unaltered. Over 1000 bugs were fixed and an
extensive code audit done, making Yamagi Quake II one of the most solid Quake
II implementations available. Other than most ports Yamagi Quake II is full 64
bit clean, so it works perfectly on modern 64 bit processors and operating
systems.

This package provides the Quake II - Three Wave Capture The Flag.
