  <title>YaST2 - Online Update (YOU)</title>
  <description>YaST Online Update (YOU) provides a convenient way to download and
install security and other system updates. By default it uses the
official SuSE mirrors as the update sources, but it can also use local
patch repositories or patch CDs.

This package provides the graphical user interface for YOU which can be
used with or without the X Window System. It can be started from the
YaST control center.</description>
