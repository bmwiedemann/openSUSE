    <comment>Yazi (means &quot;duck&quot;) is a terminal file manager written in Rust, based on non-blocking async I/O. It aims to provide an efficient, user-friendly, and customizable file management experience.

Changes from last request:
- Replace vendored lua with lua54-devel
- yazi-bash-completion now supplements again bash-completion
- Remove tar.zst sources, as obscpio is also available and should be preferred than zst</comment>
