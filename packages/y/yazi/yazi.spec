%description
Yazi (means "duck") is a terminal file manager written in Rust, based on non-blocking async I/O. It aims to provide an efficient, user-friendly, and customizable file management experience.

üí° A new article explaining its internal workings: Why is Yazi Fast?

    üöÄ Full Asynchronous Support: All I/O operations are asynchronous, CPU tasks are spread across multiple threads, making the most of available resources.
    üí™ Powerful Async Task Scheduling and Management: Provides real-time progress updates, task cancellation, and internal task priority assignment.
    üñºÔ∏è Built-in Support for Multiple Image Protocols: Also integrated with √úberzug++, covering almost all terminals.
    üåü Built-in Code Highlighting and Image Decoding: Combined with the pre-loading mechanism, greatly accelerates image and normal file loading.
    üîå Concurrent Plugin System: UI plugins (rewriting most of the UI), functional plugins (coming soon), custom previewer, and custom preloader; Just some pieces of Lua.
    üß∞ Integration with fd, rg, fzf, zoxide
    üí´ Vim-like input/select component, auto-completion for cd paths
    üè∑Ô∏è Multi-Tab Support, Scrollable Preview (for videos, PDFs, archives, directories, code, etc.)
    üîÑ Bulk Renaming, Visual Mode, File Chooser
    üé® Theme System, Custom Layouts, Trash Bin, CSI u
    ... and more!
