  this version (5.1.2).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug 29 13:57:15 UTC 2013 - ke@suse.de

- Update to 4.2.65:
  + Various enhancements and bug fixes; for more info, see
    http://www.indexdata.com/yaz/doc/NEWS; e.g. since the last update:
  + New utility z_get_HTTP_Response_details - an extended version of
    z_get_HTTP_Response.
  + New utility yaz_url_get_error which returns error message of last
    failed yaz_url_exec call.
  + yaz-url and url functions: allow max HTTP redirects to be

  + Conversion between Z39.50 OPAC and OPACXML.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 28 10:40:47 UTC 2013 - lars@linux-schulserver.de

- update to 4.2.49:
  + ICU has a new conversion element 'join', which joins tokens 
    into one with a custom character given by the rule attribute.
  + New GFS search member: present_number. This is a hint to the
    search handler how many records are going to be fetched immediately
    following search. There's no guarantee that it's going to be 
    the case, since it depends on hit count (for Z39.50 piggyback) 
    and whether errors turn up.
  + Make a few functions static (private). The functions getbyte_stream,
    ungetbyte_stream and yaz_gets are now private. They were never 
    declared in a header file.
  + ZOOM: special options to control APDU logging.
    Using ZOOM_connection_option_set(c, "saveAPDU", "1") will enable
    logging of APDUs until "saveAPDU" option is set again. If logging is
    already enabled the effect is that current APDU buffer is cleared.
    Using ZOOM_connection_option_set(c, "saveAPDU", "0") disables
    logging (default behavior on new connection).
    The APDUs sent/received can be obtained by using
    Using ZOOM_connection_option_get(c, "APDU") or
    ZOOM_connection_option_getl(c, "APDU", &l).
  + GFS: relay implementation_version from backend
    From 3.0.40 and later, implementation_version from backend was
    not used in init response at all.

Thu Jul  3 12:39:34 CEST 2008 - ke@suse.de

- Version 3.0.34 (extract from the NEWS file since 3.0.16):
* License issues:
** yaz-ziffy is no longer part of YAZ. It is distributed separately by
   Index Data because ziffy's license is GPL2 rather then 'Revised BSD'.
** Changed license of CCL module to 'Revised BSD'. After consultation with
   remaining members of the original EUROPAGATE consortium, we are re-issuing
   the CCL module without a separate license. The software was developed by
   Index Data as part of a research project. The special license was included
   to help feed usage information back to the project consortium to support
   project evaluation. At this time, the project consortium has long-since
   disbanded, and the majority of the original principals have retired. At the
   same time, we have significantly modified the software during the following
   years, to the point where very practically no original code remains. To
   simplify re-use of the software, we have contacted those members of the
   consortium who could be reached, and agreed to re-issue the module as a
   proper part of the YAZ package.
* New features:
** Implement SSL sockets using GNU TLS (not enabled).
** yaz-ztest returns OPAC records if a client asks for OPAC.
** Improve speed of MARC-8 encoding.
** Add support for lossy and loss-less MARC-8 encoding.
** yaz-client's itemorder command may now send a file.
** Fixed yaz-marcdump to allow the use of NS prefix for record element.
** Add OPAC XML XSD (etc/opacxml.xsd).
** CQL closer to being version 1.2 compliant.
** Tcl scripts uses /usr/bin/tclsh as preferred shell.
* Bug fixes:
** Handle G1 sequneces in MARC-8 decoding. Bug #2115.
** Bug #395: ZOOM_record / OPAC record encoding problems.
** Fix error handling in cs_listen. Bug #2037.
- Enable ICU support.
- Cleanup spec file.

    directory. yaz-client now reads commands from file given by option
    -f if specified; then tries to read .yazclientrc in current
    directory.  Failing that, it reads .yazclientrc from user's home
    directory.
  * Extensions.
- Start with spec file fixes and cleanup: move ldconfig calls to the
  libyaz package, remove explicit libxml2 requirement, etc.

Fri May 28 16:00:01 CEST 2004 - ke@suse.de

- Update to version 2.0.21; changes:
  * SSL comstack now uses yaz.pem certificate file on server side
    by default. Certificate filename can be configured by calling
    comstack function cs_set_ssl_certificate_file before cs_bind is used.
  * Fix bug regarding multiple calls to ZOOM_connection_connect.
  * Implement cs_set_ssl_ctx which sets SSL_CTX for SSL comstack.
  * Do not create SSL_CTX in cs_create (ssl_type). Create in tcpip_bind,
    tcpip_rcvconnect instead. This allows user to set custom SSL_CTX.
  * ZOOM now allows inspection of X509 peer certificate for verification.
    The X509 buffer is retrived by reading ZOOM option "sslPeerCert".
  * Remove libyazssl.la. When SSL is enabled, libyaz.la has SSL support and
    all programs have too (yaz-ztest, yaz-client, zoom..).
  * Documentation about MARC decoding tools.
  * Fix encoding of xsd:string to use text instead of CDATA.
  * Fix endless loop in CQL parser with unbalanced ".
  * Use a more compact way to store MARC-8 conversion tables.
  * Fix a bug in yaz_iconv regarding conversion to UCS4 / UCS4LE.
  * Update CQL parser to use new CQL 1.1 modifiers for booleans and
    relations.
  * Another fix for decoding of XML packed records.
  * Fixes for Chunked encoding. White space not ignored after length spec.
  * Implement chunked HTTP transfer.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 12 17:56:36 CEST 2004 - ro@suse.de

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jan 10 22:10:30 CET 2004 - adrian@suse.de

- add %defattr and %run_ldconfig

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct 16 16:57:53 CEST 2003 - ke@suse.de

- Update to version 2.0.4; changes:
  - Allow any CQL relation (not just all,any,exact,scr).
  - Fixes for OCLC UI ASN.1 to make it work with SilverPlatter targets
    that features the same UI.
  - Implement command update0 in YAZ client which is equivalent to
    update but uses old of Ext Update ASN.1.
  - Use OID 1.2.840.10003.15.1000.81.1 for privately defined charsets
    in charset negotiation. Added VAL_ID_CHARSET in oid.h.
    Previously no OID was used for this info.
  - ZOOM uses smallSetUpperBound=1 instead of 0 for piggyback searches.
    It apparantely upsets EBSCO Publishing IR Z39.50 Server which
    returns 'malformed search term' otherwise.
  - SortResponse member resultCount now set to NULL in sort handler of
    frontend server.
  - OPAC support ZOOM. ZOOM_record_get returns OPAC info (as XML) if
    type is "opac".
  - Add three new utility functions for translating OIDs between various
    formats -- symbolic name such as "Usmarc", minus-1-terminated int
    arrays and dotted strings such as "1.2.840.10003.9.5.1".
  - Revert modifications for ES Update definition for z_IU0Update
    (OID 1.2.840.10003.9.5.1 and 1.2.840.10003.9.5). The definition
    is back to YAZ 2.0.2.
  - String value attributes for CCL parser.
  - Support for OCLC's locally registered "OCLC-UserInformation" PDU,
    which their FirstSearch server returns in Init responses, sometimes
    carrying useful diagnostic information when Init fails.  This has the
    OID 1.2.840.10003.10.1000.17.1 and is defined in the file
    "z39.50/oclcui.asn", where its definition is somewhat different from
    what OCLC document on their web-site, as required to interoperate with
    their servers.
  - Support for anonymous authentication in yaz-client.  Use the command
    "auth -".
  - Fix the OID of the Index Data-local "admin" Extended Service from
    1.2.840.10003.9.81.1 to 1.2.840.10003.9.1000.81.1.  The omission of
    the 1000, which indicates a locally-defined OID, was a mistake.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun 23 14:46:47 CEST 2003 - ke@suse.de

- Update to version 2.0.3; changes:
  - Fix CCL directive @case handling so that it affects string match for
    both CCL keywords and qualifiers.
  - * ESFormat-Update updates. Packages with OID 1.2.840.10003.9.5.1 and
    1.2.840.10003.9.5 are now handled by the same decoder z_IU0Update .
    Decoder has been updated with ASN.1 changes as listed in
    http://lcweb.loc.gov/z3950/agency/defns/updateES.html
  - ZOOM_record_get may now return a record in a specific character set.
    For type use "form; charset=from[,to]" where form (render, xml, ..),
    "from" is the character set of record as returned by target. "to" is
    the character set to be returned. If omitted, "to" is UTF-8.
  - YAZ ASN.1 compiler renamed from yaz-comp to yaz-asncomp
  - New ODR utility, odr_getelement, which returns name of element for
    which encoding/decoding failed.
  - Fixed ODR so that it returns error code OREQUIRED rather than ONONE
    in cases where a required element was omitted.
  - Bug fix: some MARC8 sequences were not converted.
  - New ZOOM option "step" which specifies number of records to be
    retrieved in one chunk. Used in conjunction with "start" and "count".
  - SRW support for yaz-client. Use scheme http: to use it, e.g.
    http://host:port/db
  - yaz-client no longer does (un)intelligent character set conversions
    by default. Can be enabled with charset and marc_charset commands.
  - New function, cql_strerror() translates SRW error codes, as returned
    by cql_transform_error(), into human-readable English strings.  Used
    in yaz-client diagnostics when appropriate.
  - New CQL2RPN query-type for the command-line yaz-client, parses CQL and
    converts it into a type-1 query which is sent to the server.  This
    makes CQL available for use with all Z-servers, as opposed to the tiny
    minority that can handle CQL queries themselves.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun 12 13:36:19 CEST 2003 - kukuk@suse.de

- Add missing directory to filelist

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May 26 12:21:33 CEST 2003 - ke@suse.de

- Remove unwanted files from $RPM_BUILD_ROOT.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 22 14:30:22 CEST 2003 - ke@suse.de

- Split subpackage libyaz into libyaz and libyaz-devel.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 22 11:19:18 CEST 2003 - ke@suse.de

- Update to version 2.0.2; changes:
  - New ZOOM events ZOOM_EVENT_RECV_{RECORD,SEARCH} for receiving a record
    and search result respectively.
  - New member 'schema' in struct bend_fetch_rr which the name of requested
    schema (SRW/SRU) for record (or NULL if none was given). The fetch
    handler MAY set this to reflect the schema of the returned record.
  - New member 'display_term' in struct scan_entry. GFS now sets member entries
    and allocates scan entries to be filled by user scan handler. In previous
    version, entries member was allocated by the scan handler. That still
    works,  but the GFS will ignore member display_term - assuming it was NOT
    set by the handler. The fact that the GFS now allocates the entries both
    allows for new members and makes a scan handler easier to write.
  - SRW/SRU recordPacking. For SRW default recordPacking is string. For
    SRU default recordPacking is string.
  - SRU protocol support for frontend server.
  - Add missing PQF transform rules for <= and >= .
  - Added scan for the ZOOM shell (zoomsh).
  - Bugfix: CQL lex buffer overflow.
  - Split package into yaz and libyaz.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 26 15:16:36 CET 2003 - ke@suse.de

- Update to version 2.0; changes:
  Possible compatibility problems with earlier versions marked with '*'.
  - * String Identifers for Schemas (Amendment 5).
    http://lcweb.loc.gov/z3950/agency/amend/am5.html
  - * resultCount parameter to Sort Response (Amendment 1).
    http://lcweb.loc.gov/z3950/agency/amend/am1.html
  - Support for SRW 1.0 over HTTP. This is an optional feature and
    requires libxml2 to operate. Enable SOAP by specifying --with-xml2
    for configure (not enabled on SuSE Linux).
  - Generic frontend server supports HTTP/SOAP/SRW and Z39.50/BER
    on the same port.  SRW SearchRetrieveRequests are mapped
    to bend_init,bend_search,bend_fetch,bend_close.
  - Add Z39.50 Query Type-104 - to facilitate CQL within Z39.50.
  - CQL support. Source is directory 'cql'. CQL is supported in ZOOM
    (both SRW and Z39.50) and the YAZ client (Z39.50 only).
  - ZOOM connections are SRW based if schem http is used for hostname
    in connect, e.g.  z = ZOOM_connection_new("http://myserver");
    ZOOM_query may be of type CQL, e.g. ZOOM_query_cql(q, "dc.title=x");
  - CCL proximity operators !n, %n converts to PQF @prox 0 n 1 2 k 2
    and @prox 0 n 0 1 k 2 respectively, meaning: exlusion=false,
    distance=n, order=true/false, relation=le, prox unit=word. If
    n is omitted, distance 1 is used.
  - New MARC decode API. All new functions operate on a yaz_marc_t
    handle. The most important new functions are: yaz_marc_create,
    yaz_marc_decode_{buf,wrbuf}, yaz_marc_destroy, .. to create handler,
    decode and destroy respectively. Decoder can produce formats
    MARC line, simple XML, OAI MARC and MARC XML (LoC). See
    include/yaz/marcdisp.h.
  - YAZ Iconv utility now supports MARC8 decoding (marc8.c). Converts
    to UTF-8, UCS-32, wchar_t or Latin-1.
  - * Prototypes for yaz_iconv_-functions moved to separate header 
    include/yaz/yaz-iconv.h.
  - Make a few private functions 'static' in unix.c. This prevents
    duplicate unix_close in PHP with YAZ and imap. PHP Bug 20977.
  - For ZOOM connection, the options targetImplementation{Id,Name,Version}
    are set when Init Response is received.
  - New function ZOOM_connection_error_x similar to ZOOM_connection_error
    but returns diagnostic set as well.
  - New function yaz_strerror which is a portable wrapper for
    strerror/strerror_r/GetLastMessage.
  - * ZOOM_record_get supports type "xml" in which case MARC XML (from LOC)
    is returned for MARC. If type is "oai", then OAI MARC is returned.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov 29 11:52:00 CET 2002 - ke@suse.de

- Update to version 1.9.2; changes:
  * yaz_marc_decode uses OAI MARC as XML format for ISO2709 records.

  * Add GRS-1 render for ZOOM using same format as yaz-client.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov 22 15:12:46 CET 2002 - ke@suse.de

- Update to version 1.9.1; changes since 1.8.8:
  * Add man pages: yaz-client(1), yaz-ztest(8), yaz(7), zoomsh(1).
  * Bugfixes: ESpec handling in data1 module; handle PDU encoding
    failures properly; ZOOM_record_get for type "database"; ZOOM C
    record cache so that preferredRecordSyntax and elementSetName is
    used to check for already fetched records.
  * SGML reader parses comments and makes them part of the data1 tree.
  * Add more Bib-1 diagnostics (approved extensions).
  * PQF parser rejects bad queries - including those with extra
    characters in them. PQF parser used to silently ignore that.
    Cleaner API for PQF added, which allows you to get detailed
    error information for bad queries (see yaz/pquery.h).
  * Use iconv.
  * Remov XML reader (d1_expat.c). It's part of Zebra instead.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug  5 13:06:58 CEST 2002 - ke@suse.de

- Update to version 1.8.8:
