  <title>Yet Another Telephony Engine</title>
  <description>Yate is a next-generation telephony engine. While currently focused on Voice
over Internet Protocol (VoIP) and PSTN, its power lies in its ability to be
easily extended. Voice, video, data and instant messenging can all be unified
under Yate's flexible routing engine, maximizing communications efficiency and
minimizing infrastructure costs for businesses.</description>
