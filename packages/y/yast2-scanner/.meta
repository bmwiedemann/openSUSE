  <title>YaST2 - Scanner Configuration</title>
  <description>This package provides support for the configuration of USB scanners,
SCSI scanners, scanners in HP all-in-one devices, and scanning via
network (i.e. use a remote scanner via another host in the network).

Parallel port scanners and network scanners (i.e. a scanner which is
directly accessible in the network) cannot be configured with this
tool, except for such scanners in HP all-in-one devices. Usually those
devices must be configured manually. For more information see
http://www.sane-project.org/ and the documentation in the package
&quot;sane-backends&quot;.</description>
