%description
The YaST firstboot utility runs after installation is completed.  It
guides the user through a series of steps that allows for easier
configuration of the machine.

YaST firstboot does not run by default and has	to be configured to run
by the user or the system administrator. It is useful for image
deployments where the system in the image is completely configured,
however some last steps like root password and user logins have to be
created to personalize the system.
