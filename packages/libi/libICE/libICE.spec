%description
There are numerous possible inter-client protocols, with many
similarities and common needs - authentication, version negotiation,
byte order negotiation, and so on.
The Inter-Client Exchange (ICE) protocol is intended to provide a
framework for building such protocols, allowing them to make use of
common negotiation mechanisms and to be multiplexed over a single
transport connection.
