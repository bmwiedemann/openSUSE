  <title>Frontend for libburn and libisofs</title>
  <description>
Libisoburn is a frontend for libraries libburn and libisofs which enables
creation and expansion of ISO-9660 filesystems on all CD/DVD/BD media supported
by libburn. This includes media like DVD+RW, which do not support multi-session
management on media level and even plain disk files or block devices.  Since it
specializes on data files in ISO-9660 filesystem images it is not suitable for
audio (CD-DA) or any other CD layout which does not entirely consist of
ISO-9660 sessions.
