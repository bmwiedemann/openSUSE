%description
A library that extends the GNU libc with some functions and macros from BSD,
most notably the string functions strlcpy(3), strlcat(3) and the *BSD
sys/queue.h and sys/tree.h APIs.

glibc is not offering the _SAFE macros from the BSD sys/queue.h API —
recommended when traversing lists to delete/free nodes.
