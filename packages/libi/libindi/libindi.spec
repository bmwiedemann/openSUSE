%description
INDI is an Instrument Neutral Distributed Interface control protocol
for astronomical devices, which provides a framework that decouples low
level hardware drivers from high level front end clients. Clients that
use the device drivers are completely unaware of the device
capabilities and communicate with the device drivers and build a
completely dynamic GUI based on the services provided by the device.
