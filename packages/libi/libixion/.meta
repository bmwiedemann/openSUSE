  <title>General purpose formula parser and interpreter that can calculate multiple named targets, or &quot;cells&quot;.</title>
  <description>The goal of this project is to create a library for calculating the results of formula expressions stored in multiple named targets, or &quot;cells&quot;. The cells can be referenced from each other, and the library takes care of resolving their dependencies automatically upon calculation. The caller can run the calculation routine either in a single-threaded mode, or a multi-threaded mode. The library also supports re-calculations where the contents of one or more cells have been modified since the last calculation, and a partial calculation of only the affected cells need to be calculated.</description>
