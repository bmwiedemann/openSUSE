%description
LIBINT computes the Coulomb and exchange integrals, which in electronic
structure theory are called electron repulsion integrals (ERIs). This is by
far the most common type of integrals in molecular structure theory.
 
LIBINT uses recursive schemes that originate in seminal Obara-Saika method and
Head-Gordon and Pople’s variation thereof. The idea of LIBINT is to optimize
computer implementation of such methods by implementing an optimizing compiler
to generate automatically highly-specialized code that runs well on
super-scalar architectures.
