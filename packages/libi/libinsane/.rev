    <comment>- update to 1.0.10:
  * New error code: LIS_ERR_OFFLINE: returned when attempting to
    use the scanner and the scanner is offline.
  * normalizers/raw24: fix unpacking of 1bit images.
  * New workaround for Sane: 'hide_source_auto':
    + remove sources 'Auto'|'Automatic':
      those source behavior depends on the scanner and cannot be
      used reliably.
  * New workaround for Sane + Brother scanners:
    'invalid_page_size':
      some Brother scanners/drivers report there is still a page
      in the feeder, but when requesting the page, we get an
      absurd size (2500x0 for example).
  * dedicated process: do not try to log messages through the log
    socket if one of the socket has just died (happens if the master
    process crashes)
  * dedicated_process: disable backtrace support when another
    Libc than GLIBC is used 
  * dedicated_process: fix build with some Libc</comment>
