  <title>Implementation of IEC 61883</title>
  <description>This library is an implementation of IEC 61883, part 1 (CIP, plug
registers, and CMP), part 2 (DV-SD), part 4 (MPEG2-TS), and part 6
(AMDTP). Outside of IIDC, nearly all FireWire multimedia devices use
IEC 61883 protocols.

The libiec61883 library provides a higher level API for streaming DV,
MPEG-2 and audio over Linux IEEE 1394. This includes both reception and
transmission. It uses the new &quot;rawiso&quot; API of libraw1394, which
transparently provides mmap-ed DMA for efficient data transfer. It also
represents the third generation of I/O technology for Linux 1394 for
these media types thereby removing the complexities of additional
kernel modules, /dev nodes, and procfs. It also consolidates features
for plug control registers and connection management that previously
existed in experimental form in an unreleased version of libavc1394.</description>
