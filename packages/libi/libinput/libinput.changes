- Update to release 1.20.0
  * High-resolution scroll is more reliable thanks to the
    inclusion of new heuristics.
  * Better handling of BTN_TOOL_PEN on top of BTN_TOOL_RUBBER on
    graphics tablets that trigger a kernel bug.
  * libinput does not handle joysticks and gamepads. The
    detection algorithm has been improved to avoid tagging some
    of those devices as keyboards.
  * Improved clickpad detection

  * evdev: disable button scroll timeout for extra mouse buttons
  * evdev: avoid usage of bogus BTN_FORWARD name
  * gestures: avoid processing the last hold and
    motion event twice

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep 28 08:28:21 UTC 2021 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 1.19.1
  * New: Detects (and works around) buggy devices that claim to
    have a high-resolution scroll wheel but which do not actually
    send events.
  * New assumption that any non-bluetooth touchpad is internal.
  * Jumping cursor warning has been reduced once again.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep 14 11:57:29 UTC 2021 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 1.19
  * Hold gestures are a new type of gestures that are triggered
    by holding one or more fingers on a touchpad without
    significant movement. They add to the existing pinch and
    swipe gestures and allow for the implementation of
    hold-to-click.
  * High-resolution wheel scrolling has been long in the making
    and the solution ends up replacing the existing pointer axis
    API. Three new events are available:
    LIBINPUT_EVENT_POINTER_SCROLL_WHEEL,
    LIBINPUT_EVENT_POINTER_SCROLL_FINGER, and
    LIBINPUT_EVENT_POINTER_SCROLL_CONTINUOUS. These events
    replace the existing LIBINPUT_EVENT_POINTER_AXIS events, i.e.
    if you are processing the new events simply discard the old
    events.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug  3 00:05:19 UTC 2021 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 1.18.1
  * This release only adds device-specific quirks.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun  2 08:06:06 UTC 2021 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 1.18
  * Gestures' unaccelerated motion now matches the accelerated
    motion (without accel, obviously).
  * Better gesture detection should reduce the amount of pinch
    gestures detected as two-finger scrolling.
  * Pressing the wheel button down now suppresses accidental
    scroll wheel events.
  * Reworked clickpad detection means we should be more robust
    for devices with broken firmware.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 26 13:02:59 UTC 2021 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 1.17.3

    Magic Trackpad 2, some ALPS i2c touchpads and a jumping
    cursor fix for ALPS DoalPoint touchpads.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug 13 07:04:28 UTC 2020 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

  * Add original MX Master to inverted-horizontal-wheel-having mice

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug  3 08:40:06 UTC 2020 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 1.16.0
  * libinput now monitors timestamps of the events vs the current
    time when libinput_dispatch() is called by the compositor.
    Where the difference may result in issues, a (rate-limited)
    warning is printed to the log.
  * Touchpads now support the "flat" acceleration profile. The
    default remains unchanged and this needs to be selected in
    the configuration interface.
  * Events from lid or tablet-mode switches that are known to
    libinput as being unreliable are now filtered and no longer
    passed to the caller.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun 22 12:08:30 UTC 2020 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

  * Restrict slot count code to ALPS devices only due to
    side effects on other devices.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb 20 09:01:10 UTC 2020 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 1.15.2
  * Fixes three regressions; one of these is a libevdev bug.
  * Do not anymore force a proximity out on a tablet pen while
    a button is held down.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb 13 15:43:46 UTC 2020 - Stanislav Brabec <sbrabec@suse.com>

- Fix invalid RPM groups.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb  3 06:16:34 UTC 2020 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 1.15.1
  * A specific event sequence involving proximity timeouts and
    eraser buttons could previously trigger invalid proximity
    in/out sequences, leading to a crash in the clients.
  * ALPS touchpads now automatically reduce the slot-count based
    on the number of actually provided fingers. The kernel
    hardcodes 5 but we don't always get 5 finger locations, so
    now we adjust this down to match.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jan  4 17:56:40 UTC 2020 - Stefan Brüns <stefan.bruens@rwth-aachen.de>

- Remove doxygen and graphviz BuildRequires, documentation has
  been disabled for some time already.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan  3 11:40:43 UTC 2020 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 1.15.0
  * Scroll button locking and tablet pad keys support.
  * Table device hardware buttons that are designed to map to a
    specific functionality (e.g. to open the OSD) are now
    supported through the new LIBINPUT_EVENT_TABLET_PAD_KEY
    event.
  * Quirks for the Logitech MX Master 2S and the Madcatz R.A.T.3
    mouse were added.
  * Touchpad scrolling was approximately 10% faster than the
    nominal pointer speed, that has been adjusted now.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 28 08:37:10 UTC 2019 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 1.14.3
  * This release changes the horizontal scroll direction of the
    Logitech MX Master 3 back to what users would expect (this
    device ships with the wheel inverted). Tablet no longer force
    a proximity out while the tip is logically down. Single-touch
    screens sent superfluous (and wrong) motion events within the
    same touch down - that's fixed now. Finally, touchpad
    scrolling now matches the 'default' speed of the cursor,
    previously it was 10% too fast.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct 17 07:35:26 UTC 2019 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 1.14.2
  * Added quirks for specific devices, notably the Logitech MX
    Master 2S and 3, Thinkpad 13 G2, HP Elite x2 1013 G3 and the
    Lenovo T490s and X200.
  * For everyone else, the thumb detection is now less
    aggressive, fixing a few issues seen where two-finger
    scrolling was misdetected as pinch gestures.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 26 04:22:25 UTC 2019 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to new upstream release 1.14.1
  * Fix a two-finger interaction (click + drag) was interpreted
    as scroll event instead of the intended action
  * The RollerMouse v3 now has debouncing disabled so the
    double-click button works.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Aug 11 15:39:44 UTC 2019 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Drop conditionals for wacom support, all current releases of
  openSUSE have wacom support available.
- Update git-urls to current gitlab home.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Aug 11 06:30:09 UTC 2019 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to new upstream release 1.14
  * The calibration matrix is now returned correctly even when it
    is the identity matrix. And the tablet pressure range is
    scaled correctly into the available physical range.
    Previously, the bottom 5% where effectively missing and
    pressure offset on worn-out pens handling took some of the
    scale away from the top.
  * Improved thumb detection for touchpads. On Clickpad devices,
    this should make interactions where a thumb is resting on the
    touchpad or dropped during an interaction more reliable.
  * The Dell Canvas Totem is now supported by libinput. It is
    exposed as a new tool type through the tablet interface along
    with two new axes. Note that this is only low-level support,
    the actual integration of the totem needs Wayland protocol
    changes and significant changes in all applications that want
    to make use of it.
  * Touch-capable tablets now tie both devices together for
    rotation.
  * Tablet proximity out handling for tablets that are unreliably
    sending proximity out events is now always timeout-based. It
    is no longer necessary to add per-device quirks to enable
    this feature and it is completely transparent on devices that
    work correctly anyway.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun 28 07:27:31 UTC 2019 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to new upstream release 1.13.4
  * Added a quirk for the Lenovo X1 Yoga 1st gen and a
    Lenovo X230 trackpoint quirk
  * Better Thinkpad T480 trackpoint multiplier

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 29 19:53:12 UTC 2019 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.13.2:
  * Apple Bluetooth touchpads are now recognized with the correct
    touch size, which should make finger detection more reliable.
  * External tablets with a touchpad component (e.g. Wacom Intuos
    Pro series) will now rotate the touchpad by 180 degrees when
    set to left-handed. Previously only the tablet pen rotated,
    leaving pen and touch with two different orientations. Note
    that users need to set both the tablet and the touchpad to
    left-handed to have this work correctly; a better fix is in the
    works but taking longer than anticipated.
  * The button scroll timeout reduction introduced in 1.13 is
    reverted again, it caused a few regressions. If you had issues
    with your middle button, that's likely going to fix it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr  9 07:59:33 UTC 2019 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to new upstream release 1.13.1
  * Add quirk files for a HP Spectre 13 tablet, the trackpoint in
    the IBM USB UltraNav keyboard and the Toshiba Satellite
    L855-14E Touchpad.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 29 08:48:00 UTC 2019 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to new upstream release 1.13
  * Touch arbitration has improved for tablets, especially on
    touch screens. A timer set on pen proximity out means we
    don't get ghost touches anymore when the hand lifts off
    slower than the pen itself.
  * Location-based touch arbitration means that parts of the
    screen can be interacted with even while the pen is in
    proximity.
  * libinput uses the tilt information where available to disable
    touches in a rectangle around the pen where the hand is
    likely to be but leaves the rest of the touchscreen available
    otherwise. Where the UI supports it, this allows for bimanual
    interaction.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 21 11:46:35 UTC 2019 - bjorn.lie@gmail.com

- Update to new upstream release 1.12.6
  * Two quirks for specific devices (Contour Roller Mouse and the
    Acer Spin 5), two little cleanups.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan  7 11:11:54 UTC 2019 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to new upstream release 1.12.5
  * Fixes an issue with the Asus VivoBook Flip 14 TP412UA, the
    tablet mode switch is "stuck", causing the keyboard and
    touchpad to stop working. A quirk was added to rectify this.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec 18 12:44:52 UTC 2018 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to new upstream release 1.12.4
  * Three hardware-specific quirks for the HP Spectre x360
    (touchpad pressure thresholds), the Macbook Pro 11,2 (palm
    thresholds) and the Lenovo T480s (missing
    INPUT_PROP_BUTTONPAD) were added.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov  7 09:26:29 UTC 2018 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to new upstream release 1.12.3
  * A new quirk "AttrEventCodeDisable" was added

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct 24 08:08:11 UTC 2018 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to new upstream release 1.12.2
  * The Lenovo x220t and x60t do not disable the keyboard in
    tablet-mode anymore.
  * Button debouncing is now disabled on VMware virtual devices.
  * The Wacom Intuos Pro PTH-660 palm threshold was restored to
    the original value, it was changed accidentally.
  * libinput now assumes that you only have one thumb per hand,
    which is a statistically well-supported approximation.
  * A 2-finger movement out of the software button area now will
    no longer trigger spurious pointer motion events if one
    finger exits the button area before the other one.
  * The Wacom Intuos Pro PTH-660, when connected over Bluetooth,
    sometimes caused an invalid event sequence that caused
    libinput to lose track of the tap counter which again
    triggered an assertion later.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct  3 11:22:55 UTC 2018 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to new upstream release 1.12.1
  * A few entries there had to be corrected/added, including the
    one for the MS Nano Transceiver, the Dell XPSL322X touchpad
    and some of the Elan Touchpad quirks. A new quirk was added
    for the Kensington Orbit trackball which is confused about
    it's non-existing middle button and for the Asus UX302LA
    touchpad which thinks pressure isn't necessary once two
    fingers are down.
  * Apple touchpads randomly triggered an assert (under very
    specific, but easy enough to trigger conditions), which is
    fixed now.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep 11 07:55:44 UTC 2018 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to new upstream release 1.12.0
  * Fixed: The tablet axis smoothing previously caused some axes
    to change value even though the "axis has changed" bit wasn't
    set in the event.
  * The delta for tablet axis events is now always 0 for tip
    up/down events. This works around the pointer jumps seen on
    some devices when the tip is pressed/released.
  * The fuzz handling (i.e. hysteresis auto-detection) was
    restored after being accidentally removed during the
    hwdb->quirks rework.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

  - udev: the IBM X41 Tablet must not disable the keyboard in tablet mode
  - filter: cap trackpoint scale factor at 1.0
  - touchpad: don't pair external touchpads with lid/tablet mode switches
  - tools: fix grab argument passing for libinput debug-events

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun  5 11:36:37 UTC 2018 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 1.11.0
  * Automatic parsing of the trackpoint sensitivity sysfs file
    was reverted, since this caused the trackpoint to send NaN
    deltas on some devices, notiably the Lenovo CompactKeyboard
    with Trackpoint.
  * A new tool pair is available now: libinput record and
    libinput replay. These tools supersede the
    evemu-record/evemu-play tools currently used to debug events.
  * The touchpad jitter detection code has been improved to
    reduce the number of false positives. Some touchpads require
    the kernel fuzz setting to be set to avoid pointer jitter
    though, please see this page for details:
    https://wayland.freedesktop.org/libinput/doc/latest/touchpad_jitter.html
  * A new touchpad acceleration code has been merged, the
    behavior now resembles the pointer acceleration of macOS. You
    will notice that your touchpad is slower at slow speeds and
    accelerates sooner. At the same time, the speed range
    available has been greatly extended, so the slowest speed and
    highest speed are quite significantly apart now. This should,
    hopefully, allow all users to select a speed to match their
    preferences.
  * The maximum delta for trackpoints has been increased,
    reducing the amount of pressure required to move the pointer
    around the screen.
  * A bunch of trackpoint range hwdb entries to set the expected
    range for some common devices were merged. The
    POINTINGSTICK_SENSITIVITY udev property is now ignored,
    instead we just read that value directly from sysfs.

    missing double-taps. The Dell XPS13 L322X had the touchpad
    pressure ranges added to provide better responsiveness. And
    the Lenovo T440, T450s and X280 laptops had the trackpoint
    ranges added to provide better trackpoint acceleration.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr 10 01:35:22 UTC 2018 - bjorn.lie@gmail.com

- Update to version 1.10.4:
  * Biggest user-noticeable change is that the hysteresis threshold
    is significantly reduced to 0.25 of a mm now or to the kernel
    fuzz value where present. This should make touchpads a bit more
    snappy.
  * Two fixes for touchpad touch handling, one affecting semi-mt
    devices with hovering capability and one affecting the Apple
    touchpads where a touch can get erroneously detected as as
    exceeding the speed thesholds.
  * The rest - documentation and tool fixes. Nandor's udev fix
    fixes a race condition in the test suite.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 14 08:56:20 UTC 2018 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to bugfix release 1.10.3
  * Fix a crasher triggered by a specific event sequence during
    3-finger gestures (and on some touchpads 2-finger gestures).
  * Fix the new pointer jitter detection. A bitmask got lost and
    the software compared 32 bits instead of only the 3 it ought
    to care about.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar  7 09:21:36 UTC 2018 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to bugfix release 1.10.2
  * Fixes an assertion that triggered when the tapping code lost
    track of the finger count. This was triggered by palm
    detection, but only by specific event sequences.
  * Hysteresis is disabled by default now, but if libinput detect
    pointer jitter/wobble, the hysteresis is enabled for the rest
    of the session.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Mar  4 13:57:37 UTC 2018 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 1.10.1
  * This release fixes three crashers, one during tapping, two on
    startup/resume when the device node or seat were not assigned
    correctly.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb 13 08:59:48 UTC 2018 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 1.10.0
  * Dropping of the touchpad hysteresis. Previously, we employed
    a hysteresis to avoid pointer wobbles. A side-effect of that
    hysteresis was that small pointer motion wasn't as reactive
    as it should be. A previous attempt in 2016 to drop it failed
    (too many devices still needed it) so this time round we have
    a different approach: we analyse the event sequence from the
    touchpad and if we find it doesn't wobble, we disable the
    hysteresis for good. In most cases, this happens fast enough
    that you won't even notice, resulting in a more reactive
    pointer.
  * Touchpad tapping now handles palm detection where applicable,
    resting a palm on a touchpad while tapping should not confuse
    libinput anymore. Previously, palm touches were treated like
    any other touch, causing unexpected 2 and 3-finger clicks.
  * Some of the newer Wacom tablets (and older, worn-out ones)
    can have a leftover pressure on tip up. This caused libinput
    to miss out on the proximity event, leading to a constantly
    in-proximity tool. A new threshold for proximity out fixes
    this.
- Remove 0001-evdev-add-a-quirk-to-disable-debouncing-on-the-MS-Na.patch
  (included upstream)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb  8 00:02:32 UTC 2018 - jengelh@inai.de

- Add 0001-evdev-add-a-quirk-to-disable-debouncing-on-the-MS-Na.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec 14 08:33:23 UTC 2017 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 1.9.4
  * This fixes a regression introduced in 1.9.3 where some key
    events got lost or arrived out-of-order.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov 28 09:51:32 UTC 2017 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 1.9.3
  * New button debouncing code that makes the stuck buttons a
    thing of the past.
- Add kill-env.diff

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov 15 10:22:51 UTC 2017 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 1.9.2
  * Support for multiple paired keyboards for
    disable-while-typing. This is required for some of Razer's
    products where the keyboard exports multiple virtually
    identical event nodes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov  9 19:40:43 UTC 2017 - aavindraa@gmail.com

- Update to version 1.9.1:
  * Stop a crash when a lid was opened/closed multiple times while
    typing.
  * Reduction of the palm edge zone to a maximum width of 8mm (this
    notably helps users of recent macs that have large touchpads)
  * Benjamin's fix to the device groups enables touch arbitration
    on the Dell Canvas 27 (still needs libwacom changes)
- Remove name specification from %setup, not needed

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov  1 18:35:25 UTC 2017 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Use autosetup macro.
- Stop rm'ing la files, no longer exists as we are using meson
  buildsystem.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct 25 21:41:24 UTC 2017 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.9.0:
  * Fix build with meson 0.43 (option parser became stricter).
  * Touchpads can now use pressure-based palm detection if the
    hardware supports it.
  * On touchpads with ABS_MT_TOUCH_MAJOR/MINOR we can now use those
    for touch detection (especially if per-touch pressure is not
    available).
  * Touchpads now ignore extra fingers while the pointer-
    controlling finger is moving.
  * Trackpoints have had their pointer acceleration re-done.
  * Pointer devices now have button debouncing automagically
    enabled.
  * The tablet-mode switch on hybrid laptop/tablet devices (e.g.
    Lenovo Yoga) now disables the touchpad, trackpoint and internal
    keyboard to avoid fake touches when the tablet is placed on a
    lap or just held with the fingers on those devices.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct  5 19:49:03 UTC 2017 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.8.3:
  * Two user-visible fixes: The Wacom Mobile Studio Pro pad device
    was previously ignored because of its accelerometer tag, this
    is fixed now. And touchpads that are explicitly disabled by the
    user now stay disabled after a lid open event.
  * The rest is all related to the test suite to make sure it still
    runs correctly. Finally, a stray printf was removed from
    libinput-debug-events.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep  7 08:11:12 UTC 2017 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new bugfix release 1.8.2
  * Change in experience is that 2-slot touchpads (e.g. most
    Lenovos before kernel 4.12) do not support 3fg pinch anymore
    - instead we assume swipe for three fingers, which makes
    gestures a lot more reliable (3-finger swipe is much more
    common than 3-finger pinch anyway).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug 30 20:25:21 UTC 2017 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Pass --includedir="%_includedir/%name"  to meson, set includedir
  to "standard" for openSUSE, align with what we had before the
  switch to meson as buildsystem.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul 24 17:13:19 UTC 2017 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.8.1:
  * This release includes a build fix for the meson build (together
    with better meson instructions).
  * The palm edge zone is slightly increased from 5% to 8% to avoid
    accidental palm touches in the edges. On most modern touchpads
    that works out to be a 5mm to 8mm increase.
  * The second one is a straightforward bugfix: if the keyboard was
    removed while disable-while-typing was active, the touchpad
    would never turn on again.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul  3 19:26:37 UTC 2017 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.8.0:
  * libinput debug-gui is now installed by default unless disabled.
  * The biggest change in this release is that libinput has
    switched to meson as primary build system.
  * The second big change that is user-visible is that we have
    switched to a git-like approach to handling the helper tools
    for libinput. The previously installed tools of
    libinput-debug-events and libinput-list-devices are now
    "libinput debug-events" and "libinput list-devices",
    respectively. For the 1.8.x releases compat-wrappers are in
    place.
  * Tablet stylus events now average across multiple events to stop
    the wobbly lines previously produced by libinput.
  * On touchpads that provide MT_TOOL_PALM, i.e.
    in-kernel/in-firmware palm detection we now honor that bit and
    treat that touch as palm.
  * Tapping has seen some fixes for previously broken timestamps in
    the multi-tap use-cases.
  * The lid switch handling now uses a udev property to tell us
    whether a keyboard is external or internal. Together with some
    improved state tracking it should make the lid switch handling
    more reliable on devices where the lid switch is broken. The
    property is also used for disable-while-typing which makes it
    easier to special-case hardware.
- Switch buildsystem to meson following upstream changes.
- Following the above, add meson BuildRequires.
- Add graphviz, pkgconfig(cairo), pkgconfig(glib-2.0) and
  pkgconfig(gtk+-3.0) BuildRequires, new dependencies (for
  debug-gui).
- Pass tests=false to meson, not possible to run on the obs.
- Following the above, drop pkgconfig(check) BuildRequires, no
  longer needed.
- Drop xz BuildRequires: Not needed for any current openSUSE
  release.
- Drop autoconf, automake and libtool #git BuildRequires, no longer
  needed when building with meson.
- Add libinput-rpmlintrc, silence erronus rpmlint warnings.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun  9 07:58:39 UTC 2017 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 1.7.3
  * Fix a crash caused by the lid switch handler on device removal
    (depending on the removal order, an assertion was triggered).
  * A slight palm detection improvement - tapping in
    the palm edge detection zone is now ignored, thus reducing the
    number of inadvertant focus changes while typing. Previously,
    we only ignored those taps in the top half of the touchpad.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 10 18:50:20 UTC 2017 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.7.2:
  * The main change here are patches that change the pressure
    ranges for Elantech touchpads down to something more lenient.
    Previously, the range was set too high, causing the touchpad to
    behave erratically unless the finger pressure was quite high.
- Drop libinput-elantech-pressure-levels.patch: Fixed upstream.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr 25 09:11:04 UTC 2017 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 1.7.1
  * One patch fixes a test case failure for recent systemd
    versions, the other patch fixes a minor issue with the
    touchpad code that was likely never triggered anyway.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Apr 15 02:03:21 UTC 2017 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Add libinput-elantech-pressure-levels.patch to fix pressure
  sensitivity for ELANTECH touchpads causing uncomfortable
  two-finger taps, scrolls (boo#1034335, fdo#100463).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar 23 09:20:46 UTC 2017 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 1.7.0
  * cyapa touchpads now have a custom pressure ranage
  * support for switches, in particular lid switches
  * Touchpads now use pressure values to detect touches instead of
    relying on BTN_TOUCH
  * Wheel tilt events are now handled as such provided the device
    is correctly labeled by the hwdb.
  * Middle mouse button emulation is now compatible with scroll
    wheel emulation, i.e. it is possible to set scroll wheel
    emulation on the right mouse button and still enjoy middle
    button emulation.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar  8 09:34:25 UTC 2017 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.6.3:
  * A few small fixes that likely affect few users only: the
    minimum size for horizontal edge scrolling has been reduced to
    40mm and hovering touches inside a software button area are
    handled better now. Since we don't use pressure-based touches
    in 1.6.x, this is unlikely to be noticed.
  * Requesting an invalid mode group index doesn't crash anymore,
    that's pretty much UX improvement 101.
- Drop libinput-fix-crasher.patch: Fixed upstream.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar  1 19:51:34 UTC 2017 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Add libinput-fix-crasher.patch: Fix a crash when requesting
  invalid mode group indices.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb 21 22:25:16 UTC 2017 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 1.6.2
  * The top middle button on the Lenovo *40 series touchpad was
    extended by 4mm to match the markings better.
  * The Apple onebutton touchpad default to clickfinger behavior.
  * libinput-debug-devices now hides the keycode by default. All
    "normal" keys simply print as "***" instead of e.g. "KEY_A".

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb  2 09:40:16 UTC 2017 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 1.6.1
  * Tap timeout reduction from 1.6 has been reverted back to the
    previous default of 180ms.
  * The kernel LED support for tablet pads is now available.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 19 23:55:57 UTC 2017 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 1.6.0
* New touchpad acceleration. This better reflects finger motion,
  but can also go a lot faster than before, alleviating some
  concerns that the touchpad is too slow.
* The tap parameters have also been changed to provide for a more
  responsive cursor.
* The Asus X555LAB now has a smaller middle software button.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec  8 17:01:38 UTC 2016 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.5.3:
  * The HP Pavilion DM4 has a quirk added to disable (jumpy)
    multitouch events.
  * The calibration matrix udev property is now parsed for the path
    backend (and parsed in a locale-independent manner).
  * We now sync the BTN_TOOL_FINGER state on init. If your touchpad
    didn't respond until you put two fingers down, this is fixed
    now (observed on one elantech touchpad).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov 25 09:21:12 UTC 2016 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 1.5.2
  * Tweak the handling of touchpad deltas which leads to much more
    responsive pointer motion.
  * A custom quirk for the HP Zbook Studio G3 was added.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov 11 08:57:41 UTC 2016 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 1.5.1
  * Joysticks are now ignored. The code was in before but did not
    work correctly.
  * A quirk for the YHP Compat 6910 was added.
  * support for the new MOUSE_WHEEL_CLICK_COUNT udev property

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 15 19:16:54 UTC 2016 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.5.0:
  * A large part of this release cycle was internal cleanups and
    improvements to the test suite, only few new features were
    added.
  * libinput has built-in palm detection when the trackpoint is in
    use. The Lenovo *60 series (and possibly others) randomly send
    a single trackpoint event which used to trigger this palm
    detection and disable the touchpad for 300ms. To the user, this
    looked like a stuttering touchpad. This is fixed now.
  * For touchpads, we now have a new configuration option to allow
    a 1/2/3 finger tap be mapped to left, middle and right,
    respectively. The default remains at left/right/middle.
  * In the disable-while-typing code we now ignore modifier
    combinations like ctrl+s to avoid unnecessary timeouts and
    delays.
  * Other touchpad-related fixes include more responsive two-finger
    scrolling and better touch point transition handling (i.e. less
    pointer jumps after tapping and two-finger scrolling).
  * For tablets we now have automatic touch arbitration in
    userspace, i.e. we disable the touch input whenever a pen is in
    proximity to avoid erroneous pointer moves. Touch arbitration
    is currently handled by the kernel but is being phased out over
    the next couple of kernel releases. In the future this may
    allow for smart touch arbitration based on input areas, for now
    we simply copy the kernel's behavior and turn touch events off.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug 30 08:28:20 UTC 2016 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 1.4.2
* touchpad: on a non-clickpad, reset the motion history on
  nfingers change
* touchpad: reset the edge scroll state on touch up if edge
  scroll is disabled
* touchpad: always reset the motion history on finger changes

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug  5 06:37:56 UTC 2016 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 1.4.1
* udev: do not overwrite a previously set device group
* touchpad: use the udev ID_INPUT_TOUCHPAD_INTEGRATION
  property if available

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul 18 06:27:39 UTC 2016 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstrem release 1.4.0
* Mode support for graphics tablets. On many tablets, buttons,
  rings and strips can be used in virtualised modes, reflected by
  physical LEDs on the touchpad. For example, a ring may send
  scroll events when in mode 0 but zoom events in mode 1.
* Ssupport for rotation on some relative devices. This is
  particularly useful for trackballs that may be permanently
  placed at a nonzero rotation angle.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun 24 07:32:24 UTC 2016 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 1.3.3
* libinput 1.2 dropped using a hysteresis for touchpad devices
  because modern touchpads are more precise than older touchpads.
  Since it was found that even those newer touchpads are prone to
  a wobbling cursor when a finger is held still on the touchpad,
  more touchpads were marked over time with the wobbly tag,
  defeating the whole idea. The default hysteresis is now
  restored for all touchpads.
* Tablet pad capabilities are now listed in libinput-list-devices.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun 16 06:44:52 UTC 2016 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 1.3.2
* It is now warned about when a touchpad's events are significantly
  outside the kernel-announced range. This usually indicates that a
  hwdb entry is needed to make the touchpad work properly.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May 30 09:24:29 UTC 2016 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 1.3.1
* The pressure change check we used to detect finger releases has
  been adjusted to just apply to the Lenovo *50 and *60 series,
  it didn't work too well on other touchpads and resulted in
  jerky motion.
* An error message was generated for 3-finger swipes on some touchads that had
  gestures disabled, this is fixed now.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May 10 04:55:31 UTC 2016 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 1.3.0
* touchpad: exclude Logitech touchpads from disable-while-typing

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 21 07:57:12 UTC 2016 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 1.2.902
* Support for so-called tablet pads, i.e. the actual tablet part of
  a graphics tablet.
* Addition of middle buttons for touchpads with a software button
  area. Previously, a middle button could be triggered by pressing
  with a finger in the left and right button area simultanously.
  Too many touchpads are unable to reliably detect both fingers.
  The middle button area is always available when software buttons
  are enabled and encompasses the center 15–20mm on the touchpad.
* Touchscreens that have a fuzz value set on the kernel device are
  now defuzzed in libinput, thus stopping pointer wobbles
  previously seen when holding the finger still. Note that libinput
  does not _set_ the fuzz value, it merely uses it. Employ a udev
  rule or hwdb entry to set this on your device if needed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr 19 07:57:48 UTC 2016 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 1.2.4
* The top software button area on the T440-series touchpads is now
  30mm high when the touchpad is disabled to make it easier to hit
  those buttons.
* The udev hwdb entries for the Chromebooks were updated to
  accommodate for udev's silent replacing of non-alphanumeric
  characters with '_'.
* Added a fuzz filter to tablet devices.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr 11 22:10:09 UTC 2016 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.2.3:
  * The handling of the T450 jerky cursor motion had a bug, causing
    libinput to complain about invalid states (fdo#94601). This is
    fixed now.
  * The top software buttons on the T440 generation touchpads had
    their left-handed button mapping applied twice, effectively
    cancelling it out (fdo#94733). Fixed now, the top buttons will
    be mapped correctly in left-handed mode.
  * The Wacom airbrush pen slider range now sends the correct
    [-1, 1] normalized range.
  * And finally, the config call to fetch the default profile
    libinput_device_config_accel_get_default_profile() actually
    returns the default profile now.
- Drop libinput-touchpad-fixes.patch: Fixed upstream.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr  7 16:07:03 UTC 2016 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Add libinput-touchpad-fixes.patch: Fix left-handed top software
  trackpoint buttons (fdo#94733), and only post motion events if
  we have motion.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 18 20:05:35 UTC 2016 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.2.2:
  * The two main changes are better cursor handling on the Lenovo
    T450/T460-generation touchpads and the rejection of mislabelled
    tablet devices.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar  8 14:14:33 UTC 2016 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.2.1:
  * One fix for touchpads: we added a patch in 1.2 to look at
    relative finger positions during gestures to decide whether a
    gesture would be a pinch or a swipe gesture. This caused some
    two-finger scrolls to be detected as pinch gesture (fdo#94264).
    The patch added in this release fixes this issue.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb 24 14:06:35 UTC 2016 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.2.0:
  * New stable branch, nothing significant has changed since
    version 1.1.902.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb 18 22:43:08 UTC 2016 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.1.902:
  * One significant change to the API: the data provided by the
    tablet tilt API is now in degrees rather than the previous
    normalized value range.
  * libinput now has an option to disable tap-and-drag.
  * Bugfixes include fixing the the artpen rotation in left-handed
    mode and a fix to prevent an invalid serial number on proximity
    in (if the kernel doesn't immediately give us a serial number).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb 18 22:43:07 UTC 2016 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.1.901:
  * The main feature merged in this cycle is graphics tablet tool
    support. Devices tagged by udev as ID_INPUT_TABLET are handled
    by libinput now and exposed with the
    LIBINPUT_DEVICE_CAP_TABLET_TOOL capability. Note that this
    currently only includes tablet tool support, including stylus,
    eraser, cursor, lens cursor, etc. The "pad" part of the tablet
    is not yet integrated.
  * Further in this release is support for three-finger pinch
    gestures on supported hardware. As already announced in 1.1.5,
    semi-mt touchpads do not support gesture recognition, the data
    is not reliable enough.
  * We still reserve the right to change the new tablet API before
    the 1.2 release, though we don't expect the need for any
    changes.
- Add pkgconfig(libwacom) BuildRequires: New dependency for wacom
  support.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb 18 22:43:06 UTC 2016 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.1.8:
  * Two small fixes to the touchpad code. Synaptics semi-mt devices
    are now using a hysteresis again to stop the cursor from
    wobbling (expected fallout from 1.1.6).
  * The no-tappping zone on the far left/right edges has been
    extended down from half the touchpad to the top edge of the
    software buttons (if any). This prevents phantom taps when a
    palm briefly touches the edge of the touchpad.
- Changes from version 1.1.7:
  * This release fixes an issue introduced by 1.1.6's new
    disable-while-typing handling. If dwt was disabled while a key
    was held down, the touchpad remained disabled due to a
    recurring timer. This is fixed now.
  * The other change enables the touchpad motion hysteresis by
    default for all ALPS Rushmore touchpads (firmware 0x310).
- Changes from version 1.1.6:
  * The calculation of finger motion for multifinger gestures
    (including two-finger scrolling) was buggy. A slow two-finger
    motion could double the effective speed under some
    circumstances, causing scroll jumps. This has been fixed now.
  * The touchpad motion hysteresis is now deactivated by default.
    This may negatively affect some (especially older) touchpads,
    and we'll have to re-enable the hysteresis on those. If you
    notice pointer wobbles when hold the finger still please file a
    bug so we can address this. Everyone else should see a smoother
    motion especially on small and tiny motions making single-pixel
    elements much easier to target.
  * Disable-while-typing now works when a key is held down. And the
    pairing algorithm has been improved to avoid cases where the
    touchpad was paired with an external USB keyboard, despite
    there being a internal keyboard.
  * Last: the mode button on the Cyborg RAT 5 is now disabled. This
    button is special, on each press it cycles through 3 'modes',
    sending a release event for the current button and a down event
    for the next event code. This causes stuck buttons, since we
    have nothing in userspace that would handle that button as
    intended, disabling it is the current solution.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 25 15:38:41 UTC 2016 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.1.5:
  * This release fixes a disable-while-typing issue on the Macbook
    Pro and works around some middle-finger tap issues on semi-mt
    devices. Unfortunately, due to the inconsistent (and often
    garbage) data that semi-mt touchpads send we had to resort to
    disabling pinch gestures on those devices to make three-finger
    taps reliable.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec 22 13:04:12 UTC 2015 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.1.4:
  * One significant change: previously, we used to take the
    device's fd from open_restricted() and start synching the
    device immediately. If the fd is not closed between a
    close_restricted() and a subsequent open_restricted(), or if
    the time between opening the fd and handing it to libinput is
    great enough, some events accumulate on the fd and are (in
    part) immediately replayed after opening the device or
    confusing libinput. We now drain any pending events on the fd
    after the caller hands it to us.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec 16 22:07:02 UTC 2015 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.1.3:
  * Only one change that affects users, and that one is limited to
    users of the Lenovo x220 with an updated touchpad firmware
    version 8.1.
- Changes from version 1.1.2:
  * The 2-finger scroll threshold was reduced to 1mm which
    significantly reduces the delay users experienced when
    scrolling.
  * BTN_TOOL_* events are not posted as button events anymore.
    These aren't button events anyway, they are signals from the
    kernel that a different tool is being used.
  * Once diagonal scrolling was triggered, scroll events without a
    horizontal or vertical would still have the matching axis flag
    set and look like scroll stop events to the caller.
  * On a semi-mt touchpad with hovering capabilities, releasing
    both fingers within the same event frame caused a bug log
    message, this is fixed now.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov 24 12:44:41 UTC 2015 - alarrosa@suse.com

- List the package contents inside /lib/udev since we don't
  want libinput-udev to own /lib/udev itself, which is already owned
  by the udev package.
- Modified summary of libinput-udev to begin with a capital letter
  as required by rpmlint.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov 17 10:06:44 UTC 2015 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.1.1:
  * Two significant fixes and a couple of other cleanups.
  * Pointer acceleration is now initialized for pointer-like device
    without buttons. Some devices have rel x/y axes but no buttons
    and aren't tagged as pointers by udev. If such a device sent an
    event it could cause a crash in libinput.
  * An error in in the struct list handling caused device groups to
    write to invalid memory. The immediate effect observed was that
    the log priority changed seemingly randomly, but different
    optimization options may cause other effects.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct 28 23:05:43 UTC 2015 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.1.0:
  * This is a relatively small update, most of the bugfixes have
    found their way into the libinput 1.0.x releases.
  * The big addition here is the introduction of pointer
    acceleration profiles, or, more specifically, the "flat"
    profile. By default, libinput provides some (device-specific)
    pointer acceleration as outlined in
    http://wayland.freedesktop.org/libinput/doc/latest/pointer-acceleration.html
  * There is significant demand for the device to move
    unaccelerated, i.e. the device's virtual movements to move 1:1
    to the physical movements. Changing the device's acceleration
    profile to the "flat" profile achieves exactly that. For a
    device in the flat profile, the speed setting range merely
    multiples the deltas with a constant value (for a speed of 0,
    the default, the value is 1).
- Drop
  libinput-touchpad-serial-synaptics-needto-fake-new-touches.patch
  We have kernel-4.2.x in Tumbleweed now.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 26 20:14:05 UTC 2015 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.0.2:
  * This release contains two tapping fixes. A multitap (triple
    tap, quadruple tap, ...) caused one too many click events,
    particularly noticable during a double-tap-and-hold dragging
    process.
  * The second fix avoids erroneous click events when two fingers
    are placed on the touchpad and one finger is released within
    the tap timeout. This can happen when executing short but
    frequent two-finger scroll movements.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep  3 14:34:43 UTC 2015 - mpluskal@suse.com

- Update to 1.0.1
  * filter: fix constant acceleration for the X230

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug 26 07:01:59 UTC 2015 - mpluskal@suse.com

- Update to 1.0.0
  * doc: inverse event type restriction of x and y accessors
  * doc: ellipse instead of ellipsis
  * test: fix gcc warning about missing prototypes
  * doc: fix more typos
  * doc: add a diagram for evemu and note that libinput doesn't recordings
  * configure.ac: libinput 1.0

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug 21 08:34:34 UTC 2015 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 0.99.1:
  * Release candidate for libinput 1.0.
  * No additions to the API, this release only contains a couple of
    bugfixes and general improvements.
  * The most obvious fix is that natural scrolling now also works
    for edge scrolling. The threshold needed to trigger scrolling
    on a touchpad was reduced to 2mm in 0.21 but a bug prevented
    that from activating until 5mm movement was hit.
  * Touchpad scrolling now uses unaccelerated motion data. This
    provides better behavior for short consecutive scroll motions
    and a better 1:1 mapping between finger and content, especially
    with natural scrolling.
  * The pointer acceleration code has been cleaned up, though the
    focus here was to make it easier to understand for developers.
    The functionality remained largely the same aside from a few
    bugfixes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug  4 16:35:20 UTC 2015 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 0.21.0:
  * A new addition to the API is the configuration option to toggle
    disable-while-typing. It's still enabled by default, but can
    now be disabled for the use-cases where it is problematic
    (games, for example). The API is the usual quartett of
    configuration options:
    - libinput_device_config_dwt_is_available
    - libinput_device_config_dwt_set_enabled
    - libinput_device_config_dwt_get_enabled
    - libinput_device_config_dwt_get_default_enabled
  * The second addition to the API is the ability to get the time
    in microseconds from an event:
    - libinput_event_gesture_get_time_usec
    - libinput_event_keyboard_get_time_usec
    - libinput_event_pointer_get_time_usec
    - libinput_event_touch_get_time_usec
  * libinput switched internally to use µs for all timestamps which
    will help those devices that have a sampling frequency of more
    than 1000Hz.
  * Thumb detection, added for 0.20, has seen fine-tuning to reduce
    the number of misdetection. Likewise, the gesture code has seen
    a bunch of changes to tune the reliability of gesture
    detection, especially on semi-mt touchpads.
  * Scrolling is now more reactive too, with reduced thresholds
    before scrolling kicks in.
  * Merged a bunch of device-specific device handling to
    work around quirks and deficiencies in some touchpad hardware.
- Add
  libinput-touchpad-serial-synaptics-needto-fake-new-touches.patch
  following upstreams advice for kernel 4.1.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jul 18 08:28:06 UTC 2015 - tittiatcoke@gmail.com

- Update to version 0.20.0:
  * The big new addition in this release is support for touchpad
    gestures. Two types of gestures are supported: swipe and pinch.
    Swipe is triggered by a movement of 3+ fingers in the same
    direction, pinch is triggered by two fingers moving towards or
    away from each other and/or a rotation around a logical center.
    Both gestures, once triggered, can move around the touchpad,
    making it possible to use them for fine-grained motion.
  * Edge scrolling is now possible on clickpads too and thus available
    on all touchpads. Thumb detection was added, it is now possible
    to rest the thumb on a clickpad while moving a pointer without
    interference
  * libinput now requires touchpads to have a resolution. If the
    kernel device does not set it and none of the hwdb rules do either,
    libinput assigns a default resolution to the device. This may have
    an effect on your touchpad, please file a bug if you notice
    anything untoward. On the positive side it removes the magic
    numbers sprinkled through the code

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul  9 19:22:18 UTC 2015 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 0.19.0:
  * The biggest change in this release is improved pointer
    acceleration code. Previously, slow movements were decelerated.
    For anything resembling normal motion the pointer response is
    effectively 1:1, making the cursor respond nicely to your mouse
    movement.
  * Low-dpi devices had a bug where they would skip pixels for
    small movements. This was caused by the pointer normalization
    to 1000dpi. Devices with a native resolution below 1000dpi now
    have their own acceleration curve, providing much better
    behaviour.
  * The side-effect of this is that we had to drop the pretense of
    normalization to 1000dpi. The documentation has been adjusted.
  * The second side-effect is that the unaccelerated data is now
    closer (or equal) to the device native resolution.
  * The second user-visible change is disabling of tap drag-lock by
    default. A new config API triplett is available to enable it:
    libinput_device_config_tap_set_drag_lock_enabled
    libinput_device_config_tap_get_drag_lock_enabled
    libinput_device_config_tap_get_default_drag_lock_enabled
  * Other fixes include better responsiveness of the touchpad when
    switching from the trackpoint to the touchpad and a smaller
    edge scroll motion threshold. And of course the usual bugfixes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun 23 08:12:33 UTC 2015 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 0.18.0:
  * Touchpad handling has improved filters for erroneous small
    movements. Palm detection in the edge scrolling zone has been
    disabled, it previously caused unreliable edge scrolling on
    larger touchpads.
  * Alps touchpads now always provide a config option for middle
    button emulation - these devices don't know whether a middle
    button is available, providing the option (and defaulting to
    emulation on) allows users to have a better out-of-the-box
    experience.
  * Note that license boilerplate code has changed - it now carries
    the MIT license as intended. See the commit log for bc9f16b40e
    for details.
  * No API changes or additions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jun  6 16:21:16 UTC 2015 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 0.17.0:
  * The timeout for the tap-and-drag has been significantly
    reduced.
  * Really slow mouse movement got swallowed because the
    acceleration calculations timed out and returned an
    acceleration factor of 0.
  * Basic thumb detection was added for clickfinger behaviour, it
    is now possible to execute a single click with a thumb while
    the pointer-moving finger is resting on the touchpad.
- Changes from version 0.16.0:
  * Touchpads with ABS_MT_DISTANCE such as the Chromebook Pixel are
    now supported.
  * The tapping code now allows ending a tap-and-drag with an extra
    tap, i.e. the sequence becomes:
    tap, finger down, move .... move, finger up, tap
  * Also in the touchpad code: disable-while-typing has been added.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May  6 10:24:26 UTC 2015 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 0.15.0:
  * One new API was added: libinput_device_keyboard_has_key() which
    does what it says on the box.
  * A new tool is now available: libinput-debug-events
    This tool allows debugging libinput events directly, it works
    as something like an evtest to libinput. Note that it is very
    much a debugging tool only, do not rely on any specific
    behavior or output format.
  * A new udev property POINTINGSTICK_CONST_ACCEL is now supported
    for pointing sticks. If set for a compatible device, the input
    data is multiplied with a constant factor.
  * We've added support for the LIBINPUT_MODEL_xzy udev tag. This
    enables us to tag specific models or series in udev and apply
    required quirks.
  * A couple of bugfixes, mainly in the touchpad code. The
    doubletap timeout is now longer but multi-tapping is generally
    more responsive now.
  * Clickfinger behavior was fixed to allow left-clicks even when a
    touch isn't present on the device.
  * Button scrolling is enabled by default on some devices now,
    specifically on devices without a scroll wheel but with a
    middle button.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May  4 20:07:31 UTC 2015 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Also set Version to 0.14.1, no need to have a diff there.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr 22 14:37:33 UTC 2015 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 0.14.1:
  * libinput now provides middle button emulation for physical
    buttons and, for some devices, a configuration interface to
    enable said emulation.
  * A new tool "libinput-list-devices" was added. This tool lists
    the locally recognised devices and their respective
    configuration options and configuration defaults. Note that due
    to the design of libinput, this tool can only show the
    _default_ configurations, not the _current_ configuration of
    each device.
  * The pointer acceleration range has been widened to allow for
    greater deceleration and greater acceleration. Since we retain
    the [-1, 1] range, you may see a slight slowdown or speedup. To
    get the previous behaviour, use the value: current setting *
    2.0/3.0.
  * Five (or more) finger tapping is now handled correctly, though
    note we only send events for up to three fingers. libinput now
    supports multi-tap and drag, so e.g. three taps will execute a
    triple-click.
  * Palm detection now avoids accidental tapping, see
    http://wayland.freedesktop.org/libinput/doc/latest/palm_detection.html
  * And of course the usual bugfixing, including letting libinput
    handle more devices such as keyboards with scroll wheels or
    devices that only consist of a wheel.
- Add tool subpackage.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr  8 19:46:59 UTC 2015 - mpluskal@suse.com

- Update to 0.13.0
  * No API changes were merged in this release, the ABI is
    compatible with 0.12.0.
  * The tap motion threshold is now a fixed distance on all
    touchpads (withphysical resolution). This stops the delay in
    pointer motion seen on some devices.
  * The edge scrolling motion threshold now accumulates, so even a
    slow scroll will eventually trigger edge scrolling.
  * The velocity calculation on slow movements was fixed, this
    should provide a slightly more responsive and accurate
    touchpad motion, especially on direction changes.
  * To ease development, libinput will now print warnings when a
    caller does wrong event conversions (e.g. requesting a touch
    event when the event is a pointer event, etc.).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Mar 14 20:24:07 UTC 2015 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 0.12.0
* The new features (since 0.11) are device groups and the use of
  udev tagging for device identification. Device groups are a
  labelling system to allow callers to identify which libinput
  devices are part of the same physical device.
* libinput's API and ABI are now stable
* Fixes to correctly handle Protocol A multitouch devices.
* Buttonless touchpads are now supported (e.g. the touch portion of
  the Wacom Intuos tablets), on those touchpads tapping is enabled
  by default.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb  9 01:35:57 UTC 2015 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to new upstream release 0.10.0
* A call to libinput_device_config_accel_set_speed() with a value
  of NAn triggered an assert() in libinput.
* Pointer devices with absolute axes (such as the ones used in VMs)
  had an uninitialized pointer acceleration speed, triggering a
  warning in the xorg libinput driver.
- Changes from upstream release 0.9.0
* Support for hovering fingers on touchpads. Some touchpads detect
  fingers before actually touching the surface causing unexpected
  motion events. libinput now handles such touchpads.
* Click methods are now configurable, see below for more details.
* Support for the Lenovo X1 Carbon 3rd was added. Note that this
  requires kernel patches and a udev hwdb addition.
- API additions:
* libinput_device_config_click_get_methods
* libinput_device_config_click_get_method
* libinput_device_config_click_get_default_method
* libinput_device_config_click_set_method

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jan 25 13:33:04 UTC 2015 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 0.8.0
* Improved touchpad support. For example, it is not necessary
  anymore to lift all fingers when switching from scrolling to
  pointer movement.
* Scroll event types were merged. Previously we supplied horiz/vert
  scrolling as separate event, even in diagnonal scrolling.
  Now each scroll event may contain one or more axes.
* Support for axis sources: a scroll event can be of source finger,
  wheel or continuous. This enables callers to implement kinetic
  ("fling") scrolling.
* Scroll wheel events now return the data in degrees. A matching
  udev hwdb system is in place to adjust this when needed. A
  "discrete" scroll value is available if you are interested in
  the clicks only.
* Left-handed configuration was renamed. For future tablet support,
  the button-based naming was inappropriate. A simple
  search/replace fixes this.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Dec 12 02:00:29 UTC 2014 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 0.7.0
* Devices can be disabled/enabled at runtime. This includes smart
  disabling of touchpads when a USB mouse is plugged in, and smart
  disabling of the T440 touchpads so that the top buttons still
  work even when the touchpad is disabled.
* Edge scrolling is available on some devices, and the scroll
  method can be switched at runtime
* Trackpoints can scroll by pressing the middle button and moving
  the stick. This button-scrolling method is also available on
  other devices on request.
* Pointer acceleration is becoming device-resolution independent,
  provided your device has a DPI entry in the udev hwdb. This makes
  high-resolution gaming mice behave normally. See this post for
  more details:
  http://who-t.blogspot.com/2014/12/building-a-dpi-database-for-mice.html
* Pointer speed can be changed at runtime.
* Natural scrolling is now available, for touchpads and mice.
* Devices can be switched to left-handed, libinput handles the
  details.
* Devices can be asked to change their assigned logical seat at
  runtime.
* Relative pointer events also provide unaccelerated motion. Note
  that this is _not_ raw data as it comes from the device, it is
  normalized to 1000dpi.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep 12 10:54:15 UTC 2014 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 0.6.0
* This release has some API changes, namely:
  "libinput_device_get_keys" is deprecated.
* Initial device state can now always be assumed to be that no
  keys are pressed. Calibration of touch devices has been changed
  to be using a normalized calibration matrix. While
  libinput_device_calibrate has undergone this change, it has
  also been deprecated and replaced with a configuration API.
* The implicit reading of the udev parameter WL_CALIBRATION has
  been removed in favor for LIBINPUT_CALIBRATION_MATRIX. The
  usage of WL_CALIBRATION was broken because the translation part
  of its matrix was in pixels which is a metric not available in
  libinput. The new calibration matrix avoids this by having the
  translation be normalized to the dimension of the device
  dimensions. See the documentation for details about how to use
  the LIBINPUT_CALIBRATION_MATRIX udev parameter.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug 22 21:14:17 UTC 2014 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 0.5.0
* Device information (name, vendor id, product id) getters
* The beginning of a configuration API. So far tapping on touchpads
  can be enabled or disabled.
* As a side effect, tapping is now disabled by default and needs
  explicit enabling via the new API.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jul 13 11:22:54 UTC 2014 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 0.4.0:
* The logging system now works per-context instead of per library
  and dropped the userdata argument.
* libinput_destroy() was changed to libinput_unref(), plus you
  now have libinput_ref() too.
* A couple of renames of constants for API consistency.
  Triggered by the logging changes, creation of udev seats is now
  different.
* A couple of bugfixes, mainly in the touchpad code.
  Absolute event coordinates are now provided in mm, not
  device-specific coordinates. This doesn't change anything for
  callers using the respective_get_transformed() function.
* ref/unref() is now available for the libinput context itself.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May  1 21:25:26 UTC 2014 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Add baselibs.conf: provide libinput0-32bit. Required by
  libclutter-gst-2_0-0-32bit.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb 27 18:34:17 UTC 2014 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to initial upstream tarball release, version 0.1.0

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan 29 12:05:34 UTC 2014 - jengelh@inai.de

- Initial package (version 0.0.90~git301) for build.opensuse.org
