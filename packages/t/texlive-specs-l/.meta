  <title>One spec file for all TeX Live packages</title>
  <description>Here one rpm spec file `texlive-specs.spec' is used for repackaging the several texmf/texmf-dist tarballs of TeX Live into their own rpms.  This is done with the help of more than 2200 spec files generate by the
`generate' perl script of the package `Meta' in the same project and packed in the tarball `texlive-specs.tar.xz'.
