## Added
* Added support for ECDH with a KDF, which is used by ECC-based CMS (S/MIME).
* Added retrieval of OSSL_PKEY_PARAM_ENCODED_PUBLIC_KEY for EC keys and retrieval
  of TLS-GROUP provider capabilities to enable mTLS authentication (thanks to @rshearman).
* Added mTLS example to documentation (thanks to @hoinmic).
* Added missing RAND parameters: 'state' and 'strength' (thanks to @mccarey).
* Added ability to run tests in a container (thanks to @afreof).
* Added Visual Studio properties to simplify the Windows build (thanks to @philippun1).

## Changed

* Symmetric operations are disabled by default. In most situations these are not needed and
  cause a huge performance penalty. To enable, configure with --enable-op-digest or
  --enable-op-cipher.

## Removed

* Removed unofficial support for tpm2-tss < 3.2.0, which do not support the openssl 3.x.

## Fixed

* Fixed key export: the private keys are not exportable, which shall fix some TPM-based sign
  operations (thanks to @fhars).
* Fixed handle related operations on 32b machines (thanks to @dezgeg).
* Fixed OSSL_FUNC_KEYMGMT_HAS operations with NULL keys.
* Fixed a heap exception on some machines (thanks to @philippun1).
* Fixed build warnings when building on the Fedora Linux.
* In documentation and tests applied a correct order of providers (thanks to @hoinmic).
* Modified documentation: the user-space resource manager (abrmd) is almost mandatory for complex
  scenarios such as SSL or X.509 operations.
