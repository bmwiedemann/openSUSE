  <title>iSNS support for Linux kernel-based target</title>
  <description>Target-isns is an Internet Storage Name Service (iSNS) client for the Linux LIO iSCSI target. It allows to register LIO iSCSI targets to an iSNS server.

The iSNS protocol is specified in RFC 4171 and its purpose is to make easier to discover, manage, and configure iSCSI devices. With iSNS, iSCSI targets can be registered to a central iSNS server and initiators can be configured to discover the targets by asking the iSNS server.</description>
