  <title>5250 Emulator</title>
  <description>The 5250 is most commonly used for connecting to IBM's AS/400.	While
one can connect to an AS/400 with a VT100 emulator, it is not ideal. 
The problem is that the 5250 is a screen at a time terminal, whereas
the VT100 is a character at a time device.  The emulator uses telnet's
binary mode to transfer the 5250 data stream.</description>
