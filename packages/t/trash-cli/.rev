    <comment>Hello,
I want to introduce a new package to factory:

trash-cli is a command line application that mimics the rm command and moves the files to the XDG trash location
https://github.com/andreafrancia/trash-cli

It is useful for terminal users, because it prevents the accidental deletion of files when aliased to rm
Therefore it would be important to have the package available in the main repos.</comment>
