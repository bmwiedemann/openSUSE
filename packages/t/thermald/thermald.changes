- Update to "Release 1.9.1"
  * Remove default CPU temperature compensation for auto generated
    configuration from dptfxtract
  * Minor Android build warnings

- Update to "Release 1.9"
  * The major change in this version is the active power limits
    adjustment. This will be useful to improve performance on some
    newer platform. But this will will lead to increase in CPU and
    other temperatures. Hence this is important to run dptfxtract
    version 1.4.1 tool to get performance sensitive thermal limits
    (https://github.com/intel/dptfxtract/commits/v1.4.1).
    If the default configuration picked up by thermald is not
    optimal, user can select other less aggressive configuration.
    Refer to the README here
    https://github.com/intel/dptfxtract/blob/master/README.txt

    This power limit adjustment depends on some kernel changes
    released with kernel version v5.3-rc1. For older kernel
    release run thermald with --workaround-enabled
    But this will depend on /dev/mem access, which means that
    platforms with secure boot must update to newer kernels.

  * TCC offset limits
    As reported in some forums that some platforms have issue with
    high TCC offset settings. Under some special condition this
    offset is adjusted. But currently needs msr module loaded to
    get MSR access from user space. I have submitted a patch to
    have this exported via sysfs for v5.4+ kernel.

  * To disable all the above performance optimization, use
    --disable-active-power. Since Linux Thermal Daemon
    implementation doesn't have capability to match Intel® Dynamic
    Platform and Thermal Framework (DPTF) implementation on other
    Operating systems, this option is very important if the user
    is experiencing thermal issues. If there is some
    OEM/manufactures have issue with this implementation, please
    get back to me for blacklist of platforms.

  * Added support for Ice Lake platform

  * ThermalMonitor
    Cleaned up the plots, so that only active sensors and trips
    gets plotted.

- removed fix_long_int_i586_issue.patch and
  fix_missing_include.patch (solved upstream)
- added fix-man-thermald_8.patch and fix-systemd-service.patch
- added "power" system group
- added fillup-templates/sysconfig.thermald
- added thermal-monitor package

Fri Nov  2 17:28:31 UTC 2018 - trenn@suse.de

- Fix build for Leap 42.3 (include missing header file)
A fix_missing_include.patch
- Fix build for i586
A fix_long_int_i586_issue.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct  1 08:13:40 UTC 2018 - egotthold@suse.com

- Update to "Release 1.8"
  * Support of KBL-G with discrete GPU
  * Fast removal of any cooling action which was applied once
    temperature is normal
  * Android support
  * Add Hot trip point, which when reached just calls "suspend"
  * Adding new tag "DependsOn" which enable/disable trip based on some other trip
  * Polling interval can be configured via thermal xml config
  * Per trip PID control
  * Simplify RAPL cooling device

- Update to "Release 1.7.2"
  * Workwround for platform with invalid thermal table
  * Error printing for RAPL constraint sysfs read on failure
  * thermal-conf.xml.auto  can be read from /etc/thermald, which allows user to
    modify generated thermal-conf.xml from /var/run/thermald and copy to
    /etc/termald
