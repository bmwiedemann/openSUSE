  <title>A tool for control characters and terminal control sequences</title>
  <description>Teseq is a tool for analyzing files that contain control characters and
terminal control sequences, by printing these control sequences and their
meanings in readable English. It is intended to be useful for debugging
terminal emulators, and programs that make heavy use of advanced terminal
features such as cursor movement, coloring, and other effects.
