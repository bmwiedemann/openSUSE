    and lcg64_count_shift, have been implemented.
  * New unit tests have been intoduced to extend test coverage.
  * Special-functions unit tests use reference values with
    improved numerical accuracy now.
  * The numerical accuracy of various special functions has been
    improved to reach machine precision also in 128-bit floating
    point number arithmetic, e. g., the inverse cumulative
    probability distribution of the normal distribution,
    incomplete gamma functions and the Beta function.
