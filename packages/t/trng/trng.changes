    projects supporting CMake’s find_package.
  * Support building static or shared libraries depending on the
    BUILD_SHARED_LIBS CMake variable.
  * Cuda support has been revised to work with Cuda 12.2.
  * Experimental support for AMD’s Heterogeneous-compute Interface
    for Portabilit (HIP).
  * Several minor fixes and improvements.
- Add trng-external-catch.patch -- Allow using external Catch2 for
