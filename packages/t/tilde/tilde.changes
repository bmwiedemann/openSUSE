  * This release fixes a bug where Tilde would discard read lines
    before an invalid character, while requested to continue
    reading.

Thu Dec 19 23:57:15 UTC 2019 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 1.1.1
  * The base config from /usr/share/tilde/base.config now accepts
    all options.
  * Tilde maintains the list of recent files accross sessions.

    at previously.

- Update to new upstream release 1.0.1
  * This release rewrites the file writing code such that ownership
    and permissions are never accidentally changed.

Mon Jan  7 15:48:49 UTC 2019 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to new upstream release 1.0.0
  * Files can be opened at a specific position, by appending line
    (and column) number(s). This allows jumping to positions
    indicated by programs processing text files such as
    compilers.
  * Allow changing the default interface attributes from the
    Interface Options dialog.
  * Allow writing files if the directory they are in is not
    writable for the current user. This is ever so slightly more
    risky than creating a temporary file and moving it over the
    existing one, which is the default behavior.
  * Add menu items for the new Paste Selection (which pastes the
    X11 primary selection) and for the new Delete Line actions.
  * Make it possible to disable claiming the primary selection,
    and to automatically disable this when running over SSH. When
    running over SSH on high-latency connections and while
    running a clipboard manager locally, the primary selection
    claiming can make Tilde work slowly.
  * Rewrite files in place if the owner of the file would be
    changed by creating the file anew. This is a short-term
    solution for fixing accidental ownership changes due to the
    scheme used by Tilde to prevent file corruptions.
  * Guard against off-of-line cursor positions in finding next
    brace. This could cause infinite loops in some cases.
  * A new dialog is available that shows the codepoints under the
    cursor.
  * Allow Private-Use Area characters in input and output without
    substituion.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul 21 19:13:05 UTC 2014 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 0.3.3
* This release correctly handle errors in conversion when loading
  files. When the converter failed in unexpected ways, Tilde would
  previously crash.
* Added warnings about trying to overwrite a read-only file,
  improved the warnings about encoding issues when saving and fixed
  the setting of the comment-keyword style.
