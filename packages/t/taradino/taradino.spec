%description
The package contains an SDL port of the engine used for the
first-person 3D action game "Rise of the Triad".

The ROTT engine is a derivative of the Wolfenstein 3D one, inheriting
level design limits like orthogonal walls and flat floor and ceiling
heights throughout a map. However, the engine did pioneer panoramic
skies, simulated dynamic lighting, fog, bullet holes, breakable glass
walls, and synthetic level-over-level environments through use of
individual collision objects.
