To use either of the FLUID soundfonts (gm or gs), comment out the default
paths and uncomment either of the fluid lines in /usr/share/timidity/timidity.cfg.

When using pulseaudio the use of timidity as a system wide daemon is discouraged,
because both pulseaudio and timidity need the same device exclusively.
However timidity can be started as a daemon for the user to provide the midi
ports he/she needs for i.e. canorus. On the console of the user give the command:

timidity -iAq -Oe -s 44100
