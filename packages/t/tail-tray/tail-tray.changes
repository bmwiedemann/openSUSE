- Update to version 0.2.25 (0.2.24 was not released):
  * What's new in this release
    This release adds support for custom scriptable actions on tail
    nodes, once you've defined a scripts folder any executable
    scripts in that folder will be possible to invoke from the
    menu. More info on how scriptable actions works can be found
    here
    https://github.com/SneWs/tail-tray/blob/master/docs/scriptable-actions.md
    And, this release adds initial support for getting
    notifications when a new node is discovered, or a node is
    removed from your tailnet. This feature will continue to expand
    going forward.
