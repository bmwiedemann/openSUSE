- Update to version 1.0.20:
  * 1.0.20 (#183)
    You can now follow and unfollow tags with :follow-tag tut and
    :unfollow-tag tut.
    You can now add and remove users from lists. Run :lists and
    then you can use the keys that tut displays. This feature only
    works okay as it doesn't give you any response if the user is
    added to the list or not. But it works.
    An error from the terminal programs like lynx shouldn't crash
    tut.
    When you are reading a thread tut won't make unnecessary API
    requests
