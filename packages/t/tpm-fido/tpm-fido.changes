- Add BuildRequires: golang(API) >= 1.16 (min version per go.mod)
  This or metapackage BuildRequires: go are recommended to pull in
  the Go toolchain.
- Drop Requires: golang-packaging. The original macros for file
  movements into GOPATH are obsolete with Go modules. Macro
  go_nostrip is no longer needed with current binutils and Go.
- Remove manual call to strip the binary. Go binaries are stripped
  automatically in the default configuration.
  Refs boo#1210938
  * GNU strip circa 2016 would incorrectly strip Go intermediate
    step .a binaries (which are not .a ar archives) and write out
    an invalid binary instead of erroring on unrecognized format.
  * Error manifested in Go applications as fmt.a: go archive is
    missing __.PKGDEF on OBS built Go binaries which had passed
    their binary build step but fail at debuginfo creation step
    (which involves binary stripping).
  * The primary use of Go intermediate step .a binaries was for a
    precompiled standard library cache. The .a files comprised
    large fraction of the on-disk <go1.20 toolchain package size.
  * go1.20+ now use the normal Go build cache for the Go standard
    library. Go intermediate step .a archives are no longer part of
    the regular build process and not affected by GNU strip
    misidentifying them as ar archives.
