- Update to 1.7.0
  + DB Schema Change from 5 to 7.
    * Backup your DB before upgrading
  + Fixed compilation issues with GCC11.
  + Fixed errors on releases due to newer compilers from failing by
    only adding -Werror for non-release builds.
  + Fixed error message when the DB is too new in tpm2_ptool.
  + Added support for tpm2_ptool import with ssh-keygen format
    keys. Note: Requires cryptography >= 3.0.
  + Changed default long level from error to warning.
  + Added better error message for FAPI backend errors along with
    docs/FAPI.md document.
  + Changed tpm2_ptool make --algorithm optional.
  + Fixed error message of wrong attribute name on expected attribute
    check to be false.
  + Added support for ECDSA 256, 384 and 512.

    support:
    * addkey: previous working versions of tpm2-tools will support
      this.
    * link: previous working versions of tpm2-tools will support this.
    * import: requires tpm2-tools 5.2+ for support.
  + Fixed leaking of temp file descriptors in tpm2_ptool.
