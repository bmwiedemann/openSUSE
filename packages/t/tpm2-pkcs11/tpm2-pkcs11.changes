    only adding -Werror for non-release builds.
  + Fixed error message when the DB is too new in tpm2_ptool.
  + Added support for tpm2_ptool import with ssh-keygen format
    keys. Note: Requires cryptography >= 3.0.
  + Changed default long level from error to warning.
  + Added better error message for FAPI backend errors along with
    docs/FAPI.md document.
  + Changed tpm2_ptool make --algorithm optional.
