- Update to 1.9.0
  + Fixed
    * Fix autoconf invocation on a release tarball not being a git
      repo for VERSION. VERSION file now generated and packaged as
      part of the release tarball from the git version information.
    * Fix TPM2_PKCS11_OWNER_AUTH not being used when a persistent SRK
      is needed in the C_InitToken path.
    * During an upgrade of the database to version 4, the config key
      'persistent' is added instead of 'transient', causing KeyError
      when using the upgraded database.
    * Leave the original db on upgrade failure, a bug caused the
      original db to be unlinked not the upgraded db.
    * A bug prevented the use of CreateLoaded if the TPM supports the
      command.
    * A bug when creating keys through the PKCS11 interface (not
      tpm2-ptool), the attributes for CKA_ALLOWED_MECHANISMS were
      encoded as a hex string and not a sequence of ints within the
      YAML. Correcting this will trigger a db upgrade to 8
  + Added
    * Env varibale PKCS11_SQL_LOCK to allow setting a lock directory,
      eg for temprary directory so lock files do not persist across
      reboots.

Fri Jul  8 12:23:01 UTC 2022 - Alberto Planas Dominguez <aplanas@suse.com>

- Update to 1.8.0
  + Fixed
    * Fix GetRandom Memory Leak
    * Fix some spelling mistakes
    * Fix unit test test_parser
    * Fix importing of RSA private key through pkcs11 interface should
      fail.
    * Fix ECDSA signature length calculation.
    * Fix memory leak of tokens.
    * Fix suspicious sizeof usage in _str_padded_copy
    * Fix encoding errors when importing a certificate into the pkcs11
      store.
    * Fix try/finally scope issues in tpm2_ptool.
    * Fix, an OOB access in db upgrade path.
    * Fix ECDSA length calculation that was causing issues with Mutual
      TLS in Firefox and Chrome.
  + Changed
    * remove unused macro set_safe_rc
  + Added
    * Add support for OpenSSL 3. Note that calls through engine are no
      longer supported on OpenSSL3.
    * Add tpm2_ptool export commandlet for exporting token keys into
      PEM and TPM blob format.
- Add new dependencies to PyYAML, cryptography, pyasn1 and tpm2-pytss

- Update to 1.7.0
  + DB Schema Change from 5 to 7.
    * Backup your DB before upgrading
  + Fixed compilation issues with GCC11.
  + Fixed errors on releases due to newer compilers from failing by
    only adding -Werror for non-release builds.
  + Fixed error message when the DB is too new in tpm2_ptool.
  + Added support for tpm2_ptool import with ssh-keygen format
    keys. Note: Requires cryptography >= 3.0.
  + Changed default long level from error to warning.
  + Added better error message for FAPI backend errors along with
    docs/FAPI.md document.
  + Changed tpm2_ptool make --algorithm optional.
  + Fixed error message of wrong attribute name on expected attribute
    check to be false.
  + Added support for ECDSA 256, 384 and 512.
  + Fixed a bug in the Python code DB upgrade path from 4 to 5 where
    it didn't add AES mode CTR to CKA_ALLOWED_MECHANISMS.
  + Added tpm2_ptool support for ECC key size 192.
  + Added support passwordless login for tokens, ie not setting
    CKF_LOGIN_REQUIRED.
  + Fixed Running integration tests when Java version has the -ea,
    like on Debian 11 and OpenJDK 17.
  + Added support for HMAC keys using tpm2_ptool and the C_Sign and
    C_Verify interfaces. The following interfaces in ptool have
    support:
    * addkey: previous working versions of tpm2-tools will support
      this.
    * link: previous working versions of tpm2-tools will support this.
    * import: requires tpm2-tools 5.2+ for support.
  + Fixed leaking of temp file descriptors in tpm2_ptool.
  + Fixed wrong free in tpm code, should use Esys_Free.
  + Fixed a space formatting issue in tpm2_ptool verify.
  + Fixed leaked file descriptor in tpm2_ptool.
  + Fixed a few suspicious sizeof usages in str_padded_copy
  + Fixed a memory leak of the token list on a failure condition in
    initialization.
