- update to v2021.7.0:
  * Memory allocator crash on a system with an incomplete /proc/meminfo
    (GitHub* #584).
  * Incorrect blocking of task stealing (GitHub* #478).
  * Hang due to incorrect decrement of a limiter_node (GitHub* #634).

  * Crash when obtaining a range from empty ordered and unordered containers
    (GitHub* #641).
  * Deadlock in a concurrent_vector resize() that could happen when the new
    size is less than the previous size (GitHub* #733).
