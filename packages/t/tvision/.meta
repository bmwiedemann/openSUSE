  <title>Modern port of Turbo Vision 2.0 with cross-platform and Unicode support</title>
  <description>A modern port of Turbo Vision 2.0, the classical
framework for text-based user interfaces. Now
cross-platform and with Unicode support.

Turbo Vision lets application developers avoid
writing platform-specific workarounds for TUI apps.
It attempts to reproduce consistent results everywhere,
without developers worrying about terminal capabilities,
direct I/O, ifdefs, and other platform quirks.

Turbo Vision provides many widget classes (also known
as views), including resizable, overlapping windows,
pull-down menus, dialog boxes, buttons, scroll bars,
input boxes, check boxes and radio buttons. You may
use and extend these; but even if you prefer creating
your own, Turbo Vision already handles event dispatching,
display of fullwidth Unicode characters, etc.</description>
