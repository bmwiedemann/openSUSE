    <comment>Hi there,

I am resubmitting tvision for inclusion into openSUSE Factory. This is a modernised port of the Turbo Vision 2.0 framework, originally from the public domain release by Borland. It has cross-platform and Unicode support, striving to be a relatively easy way to create applications with TUIs (text-based user interfaces) that are consistent across platforms without app developers needing to handle platform-specific quirks.

The spec file generates two packages:
* tvision-devel-static - static library, headers, and help file compiler of Turbo Vision 2.0
* tvision-demos - demo programs showing off Turbo Vision 2.0

The two demo programs in tvision-demos:
* tvdemo - demo program with multiple applets showing off Turbo Vision widgets
* tvedit - basic text editor demoing Turbo Vision in a practical application

This request is a necessary prerequisite for the turbo editor to be packaged later:
https://github.com/magiblot/turbo

This request has a significantly cleaner changes file, dependencies have also been cleaned up, devel merged into devel-static, and a patch from an earlier revision has been removed due to being merged upstream:
