  <title>A dynamic adaptive system tuning daemon</title>
  <description>The tuned package contains a daemon that tunes system settings dynamically.
It does so by monitoring the usage of several system components periodically.
Based on that information components will then be put into lower or higher
power saving modes to adapt to the current usage. Currently only ethernet
network and ATA harddisk devices are implemented.
