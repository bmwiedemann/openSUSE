  <title>A Video Transcoder</title>
  <description>Transmageddon is a video transcoder for Linux and Unix systems
built using GStreamer. It supports almost any format as its input
and can generate a very large host of output files. The goal of the
application was to help people to create the files they need to be
able to play on their mobile devices and for people not hugely
experienced with multimedia to generate a multimedia file without
having to resort to command line tools with ungainly syntaxes.</description>
