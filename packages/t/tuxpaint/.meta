  <description>Tux Paint&quot; is a drawing program for young children. It has a simple
interface and fixed canvas size, and provides access to previous images
using a thumbnail browser (it provides no access to the underlying
filesystem).

Unlike popular drawing programs such as &quot;The GIMP,&quot; it has a very
limited toolset. However, it provides a much simpler interface, and has
entertaining, child-oriented additions such as sound effects.
