Fri Jan  3 13:38:19 UTC 2025 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Fix `desktop-file-install` usage:
  * Drop `-add-category=KidsGame` as the category is already
    included in source .desktop file.
  * Drop use of `--vendor` option: unnecessary and causes build
    failures in Staging project (where %vendor is undefined).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Dec 21 11:59:02 UTC 2024 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

    section of Tux Paint, to the main toolbar.
  * Some performance improvements during start-up and when
    bringing up the "New" drawing dialog.
  * The solid background colors can also be placed at the end of
    start-up dialog, allowing emphasis of template images.
  * Allow disabling stereo sound.
  * For a full list of changes, see
    /usr/share/doc/packages/tuxpaint/CHANGES.txt.
- Drop use of deprecated %suse_update_desktop_file macro; use
  desktop-file-utils instead.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug  2 06:18:46 UTC 2024 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Update to version 0.9.33:
  * A new Filled Polygon magic tool offers a way to create
    arbitrary filled polygonal shapes.
  * A pair of Dither tools transform a drawing into a pattern of
    dots reminiscent of classic computer displays or other devices
    which can only show black and white.
  * Add a set of fully transparent erasers to allow partially
    exposing a background Starter or Template image (including
    those created within Tux Paint) for subtle fading or ghost
    effects.
  * New Brushes have been added to the "Paint" and "Lines" tools.
  * Brushes may have unique, localized descriptions.
  * The "3D Glasses" Magic tool now offers multiple anaglyphic
    color separation options.
  * Magic tools may be upgrouped, appearing as one long list.
  * Documentation improvements.
- Switch Requires: freefonts -> gnu-free-fonts.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb  2 17:01:26 UTC 2024 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Update to version 0.9.32:
  * New tools (see
    https://tuxpaint.org/latest/tuxpaint-0.9.32-press-release.php
    for more details):
    - Perspective, Orthographic, and Oblique projection tools.
    - Centered Trochoid creation tools.
  * A new "complexity" setting allows the user's expertise level
    with Tux Paint (or computers in general) to dictate the
    complexity of certain Magic tools.
  * Magic tools have been reorganized, and are no longer ordered
    by their localized names.
  * Font face and size details are shown when using the Text and
    Label tools. 
  * Minor bug fixes.
  * Documentation and translation updates.
- Make devel package noarch in keeping with rpmlint's
  recommendation: package only installs some config scripts
  and header files.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan  2 06:13:52 UTC 2024 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Update to version 0.9.31:
  * New Magic Tools:
    - Loops - Draw loop-the-loops.
    - Ribbon - Paints a flowing, fixed-length ribbon.
    - Smooth - Freehand paintbrush with a smoothing effect (Bezier
      curve)
    - Squiggles - Draw squiggly shapes.
  * Improvements to Magic tools: Calligraphy offers size
    (thickness) options.
  * Improvements to Eraser tool: Fuzzy round erasers.
  * Improvements to Fill tool: When using the Linear Gradient fill
    tool, the angle of the gradient is now is shown (in the
    instructions at the bottom).
  * Other Improvements:
    - Saved pictures can, from the Open dialog, be copied into the
      user's templates directory, and used as backgrounds for
      other drawings by selecting it from the New dialog.
    - "Erase" controls may be disabled via a new simplification
      configuration setting, "noerase".
    - Ability to specify a font for Tux Paint's UI (button labels,
      dialog boxes, Tux tip text at the bottom), "uifont".
    - Different default fonts once again used on a per-locale
      basis.
    - Made it easier to tell when color picker (HSV palette) is
      the currently-selected color.
  * Bug Fixes:
    - In some window size / button size combinations, Eraser
      scroll buttons were missing, and button clicks inaccurate.
    - Improved Eraser XOR outline when using Ctrl-Z & Ctrl-R for
      Undo/Redo, and Eraser and Stamp XOR outlines when using
      click+X for quick eraser access.
    - When specifying "datadir", Tux Paint's "New" dialog was able
      to present templates found in that directory, but would
      attempt to load from whatever the user's "savedir" was,
      instead.
    - Exported drawings (to e.g. ~/Pictures) would contain
      extraneous data beyond the end of the data (copied from the
      original PNG).
    - Shell expansion (via wordexp()) of configuration options
      containing spaces (e.g., `printcommand=ps2pdf - - >
      $HOME/print.pdf`) would fail & cause a crash.  It now shows
      an error and recommends adding quotes. (e.g.,
      `printcommand="ps2pdf - - > $HOME/print.pdf"`).
    - Mended bad rendering of color picker (HSV palette) button
      when selecting a Label text with a color not found in
      built-in colors, and mend unwanted outline around the chosen
      color in the color selector (pipette), color picker (HSV
      palette) and color mixer buttons.
  * Documentation and translation updates.
- Drop -sdl1 tarball and conditionals supporting SDL1: upstream no
  longer supports SDL1 and has hard dependency on the appropriate
  SDL2 libraries.
- Rebase patches for update:
  * tuxpaint-pango-cflags.patch.
  * tuxpaint-makefile.patch.
- Drop conditionals supporting EOL openSUSE versions (note: these
  builds are disabled in the devel project in any case).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 17 07:04:48 UTC 2023 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

    Additionally, the Fill tool now offers a freehand painting mode 
    for interactively coloring within a confined area.
  + Six new Magic tools have been added to Tux Paint.
  + A number of existing Magic tools have been updated, as well.
  + Finally, Magic tools are now grouped into collections of 
    similar effects.
