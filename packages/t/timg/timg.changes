- Update to version 1.6.2
  * Various terminals with Sixel support have different subtle and
    incompatible ways how they treat cursor placement and deal with
    newlines;
  * More ways to detect terminals and debug the process;
  * no double-used image ID in animations followed by a static
    image in kitty terminals.
- Add qoi-devel BuildRequires: to support QOI format

- Update to version 1.6.0
  * added dedicated renderers for SVG and PDF, based on librsvg and
    poppler. We're getting closer to being a universal document and
    image viewer.
  * If compiled-in, these provide higher quality rendering than the
    default, which falls back to graphicsmagick. On terminals with
    high-resolution output, this now allows to nicely read PDFs
    (on a large terminal, reading whole papers with -U --grid=3x1
    --auto-crop is very readable).
  * SVGs are now also shown in the highest resolution as the vector
    format is rendered into the available space. With -U, you get
    crisp, large renderings.  
- Add pkgconfig(poppler-glib) BuildRequires: to support PDF
- Add pkgconfig(librsvg-2.0) BuildRequires: to support SVG

- Update to version 1.5.3
  * Show high-resolution images and video in VSCode terminal (Need
    to set the Terminal > Integrated: Enable Images configuration
    in VSCode)
  * Fix some smallish memory leaks.
  * Better support for terminals that don't implement the
    TIOCGWINSZ completely and don't emit ws_xpixel and ws_ypixel,
    but happen to implement terminal esccape code \e[16t. This
    means that showing animations and columns in these terminals
    now work (this was the case for the VSCode terminal, but maybe
    others).
