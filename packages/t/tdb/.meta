  <title>Samba tdb Library</title>
  <description>TDB is a Trivial Database. In concept, it is very much like GDBM, and BSD's DB
except that it allows multiple simultaneous writers and uses locking
internally to keep writers from trampling on each other. TDB is also extremely
small.

This package contains the tdb1 library.
