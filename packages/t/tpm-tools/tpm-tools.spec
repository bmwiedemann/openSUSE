Trusted Computing is a set of specifications published by the Trusted
Computing Group (TCG). The Trusted Platform Module (TPM) is the
hardware component for Trusted Computing. The tpm-tools package
provides tools for enablement and configuration of the TPM and
associated interfaces. Also look inside the trousers package for more
