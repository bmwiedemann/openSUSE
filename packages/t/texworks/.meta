  <title>TeXshop-like TeX Editor</title>
  <description>The TeXworks project is an effort to build a simple TeX front-end
program (working environment) that will be available for all today’s
major desktop operating systems—in particular, MS Windows (XP and
Vista), typical GNU/Linux distros and other X11-based systems, and
Mac OS X. It is deliberately modeled on Dick Koch’s award-winning
TeXShop for Mac OS X, which is credited with a resurgence of TeX
usage on the Mac platform.</description>
