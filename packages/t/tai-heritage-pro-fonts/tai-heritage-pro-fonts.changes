- update to 2.600:
  * Fixed several bugs in the OpenType code. The fonts should now
    work in OpenType applications that use the Universal Shaping
    Engine on Windows 10.
  * Eliminated minor discrepancies between Graphite and OpenType in
    how combining marks are positioned in the Regular weight.
  * Added WOFF versions of the fonts to the distribution, for the
    benefit of web developers.
