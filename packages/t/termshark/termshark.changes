- Update to version 2.3.0
  Added
  * Termshark's columns can now be changed via the minibuffer
    columns command. Columns can be added, removed or hidden from
    view. If your Wireshark config is available, termshark can
    import your Wireshark column configuration. Custom columns can
    be chosen via a display filter expression.
  * The packet structure view now provides a contextual menu with
    options to
    + apply the structure filter as a custom column
    + prepare or apply the same filter as a display filter
  * A new console-command, "wormhole", allows you to send
    termshark's current pcap with magic wormhole. Pair with the
    tmux plugin tmux-wormhole to open the pcap quickly in Wireshark
  * Added a -w flag - if supplied for a live capture, termshark
    will write the packets to this capture file.
  * Added a config option, main.disk-cache-size-mb, that can be set
    to have termshark limit the size of its pcap cache directory.
    When the directory size exceeds its limit, termshark deletes
    oldest pcap files first.
  * Added a workflow that helps a user to upgrade from a low-color
    TERM setting if termshark detects that there is a 256-color
    version available in the terminfo database.
  * Added 8-color light and dark themes for TERMs such as xterm
    and screen.
  Changed
  * Fixed a bug that caused "And" and "Or" conversation filters
    to be incorrect if the current display filter is empty.
  * Fixed a bug that caused multi-token capture filters to fail.
  * Fixed a bug that slowed down the user's interaction with the
    display filter widget.
