  <title>A Display Filter for RFC822 Messages</title>
  <description>t-prot detects and, when demanded, hides annoying parts in rfc822
messages: TOFU (see below), huge quoted blocks, signatures (especially
when they are too long), excessive punctuation, blocks of empty lines,
and trailing spaces and tabs. For use inside of MTAs or MDAs, it may
exit with appropriate libc exit codes, so annoying messages may be
bounced easily.

TOFU is an abbreviation that mixes German and English words. It expands
to &quot;text oben, full-quote unten&quot; that means &quot;text above - full quote
below&quot; and describes the style of many users who let their mailer or
newsreader quote everything of the previous message and just add some
text at the top.</description>
