  <title>A quake like terminal for GNOME</title>
  <description>This package is based on the package 'tilda' from project 'openSUSE:Factory:Contrib'.

Tilda is a Linux terminal taking after the likeness of many classic terminals from first person shooter games, Quake, Doom and Half-Life (to name a few), where the terminal has no border and is hidden from the desktop until a key is pressed.</description>
