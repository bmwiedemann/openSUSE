%description
Tilda is a terminal emulator and can be compared with other popular terminal
emulators such as gnome-terminal (Gnome), Konsole (KDE), xterm and many others.
The specialities of Tilda are that it does not behave like a normal window
but instead it can be pulled up and down from the top of the screen with
a special hotkey. Additionally Tilda is highly configurable.
It is possible to configure the hotkeys for keybindings,
change the appearance and many options that affect the behavior of Tilda.
The screen shots below show some of the options that Tilda provides.
