- Update to 1.5.1
    * tilda_terminal: match '@' character in URLs

Sat Apr  4 11:57:49 UTC 2020 - Sam Yu <ytz1995@hotmail.com>

- Update to version 1.5.0:
	* Search is now backwards by default (Sebastian Geiger).
	* Tilda now handles monitor changes and adjusts its size automatically.
	  This is useful in cases when a notebook is connected to an external
	  monitor (Sebastian Geiger).
	* Tilda now stores the relative sizes of the window in percent rather
	  than the absolute values in pixels (Sebastian Geiger).
	* The confirmation dialogs for confirm tab close and prompt on exit are
	  now enabled by default (Sebastian Geiger).
	* When using the block cursor, the background color of the cursor
	  is now correctly applied (Brian Hsu).
	* Fixed issue in transparency. Fixes #269 (Sebastian Geiger).
	* Fixed a resize issue in fullscreen mode. Fixes #306 (Sebastian Geiger).
	* Tilda now uses asynchronous command spawning. A new option supports
	  changing the default timeout when spawning a command
	  (default is 3 seconds) (Sebastian Geiger).
	* Various fixes related to the window title. Tooltips now display
	  full tab title (Tom Briden). Fixed missing title on initial window and
	  fixed a problem with setting the title when switching between tabs. Also
	  the computation of the title is now more consistent between the window
	  title, tooltips and the tab title (Sebastian Geiger).
	* When loading configuration files tilda follows symlinks.
	  Fixes #327 (Sebastian Geiger).
	* Tilda now uses xdg-open to open web links rather
	  than x-www-browser (lucasbru).
	* In non-X11 environments such as Wayland tilda will now always use the
	  X11 backend (Roman Hoellen).
	* Exclamation mark '!' is now supported by the HTTP regex for detecting
	  web links.
	* Added a check if lock dir exists which avoids a warning when tilda
	  starts the first time and the lock dir has not been created yet
	  (Sebastian Geiger).
	* We now correctly free the resources when closing the a terminal tab
	  (Sebastian Geiger).
	* Tilda now uses structured logging. In debug mode tilda will automatically
	  output all debug messages. In non-debug mode, debug messages can still
	  be output by exporting G_MESSAGES_DEBUG=tilda (Sebastian Geiger).
	* Removed 'Allow Bold' option (Sebastian Geiger).
	* Removed deprecated antialiasing option (Sebastian Geiger).
	* Dropped support for older VTE versions (Sebastian Geiger).

  hotkey support may be lost (boo#1080341).
