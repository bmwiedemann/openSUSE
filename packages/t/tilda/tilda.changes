  * Tilda now supports a new command line option to specify the

  * The 'Tab Position' option has been moved to appearance section
    in the wizard.

    fill all available horizontal space.

    only a single tab is open.
  * Tilda can now be configured to show a confirmation dialog when
    closing a tab or when when tilda is closed.

  hotkey support may be lost (boo#1080341).
