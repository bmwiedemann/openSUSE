Sat Mar  2 15:34:16 UTC 2024 - Andrea Manzini <andrea.manzini@suse.com>

update to version 2.0.0:
	* Extracted context menu into new file and added copy link action
	* Include the man page from the Debian page directly with tilda,
	  this ensures that the man page can also be shipped on other
		distributions besides Debian and Ubuntu.
	* Fixed an issue related to styling and transparency that could cause
	  certain widgets to become transparent and which caused issues on dark
		themes that led to the search box always having a white background.
	* Further fixes related to BadWindow and BadMatch Xorg errors. In addition
		we removed the custom XOrg errror handling in favor of error traps.
	* Fixed related to time stamp handling with Xorg related call
	* Added support for OSC8 hyperlinks.
	* It is now configurable whether the terminal match activation
	  requires the press of the CTRL key. Fixes #368 (Sebastian Geiger)
	* We integrate code from Gnome Terminal to improve the matching
	  functionality. As a result Tilda now supports improved matching
		of URL and can also match file names, emails and numbers. This
		is configurable in the preferences. Parts of the code are GPLv3
		licensed, so the overall Tilda license becomes GPLv3. If
		matching rules are enabled and a match is detected, then the
		Tilda context menu will show a copy link for the match.
	* It is now possible to unbind a hotkey in the preferences.
	* We remove the XDG migration code, this have been part of tilda
	  for 10 years and all tilda users should have long migrated to
	  the new XDG config locations.
	* This release adds D-Bus support, which makes it possible to
	  control the pull behavior with a D-Bus action. More details
		can be found in the updated man page.
	* In addition to the D-Bus support Tilda also supports a new option
	  '-T' which allows to toggle a certain tilda instance to make
		it easier to invoke the toggle action 
	* Tilda ships a new desktop file to start with D-Bus support
	  enabled. We also improved the existing desktop files.
	* Allow ergonomic use of CTRL+C for copy. If text is selected,
	  then CTRL+C will copy, otherwise, it will abort the current
		commands.
	* Add option to display bold font in bright color
	* Fixed a possible race-condition when multiple tilda processes
	  are started in quick succession that could lead to multiple
		processes using the same config file.
	* Add new option to insert new tabs after the current tab.

update to version 1.5.5:
	* Fixed an out-of-bounds error that could cause a segmentation fault

    error in certain situations (such as when using the Marco
    window manager of the Mate Desktop 1.24.1)

Sat Apr  4 11:57:49 UTC 2020 - Sam Yu <ytz1995@hotmail.com>

- Update to version 1.5.0:
	* Search is now backwards by default (Sebastian Geiger).
	* Tilda now handles monitor changes and adjusts its size automatically.
	  This is useful in cases when a notebook is connected to an external
	  monitor (Sebastian Geiger).
	* Tilda now stores the relative sizes of the window in percent rather
	  than the absolute values in pixels (Sebastian Geiger).
	* The confirmation dialogs for confirm tab close and prompt on exit are
	  now enabled by default (Sebastian Geiger).
	* When using the block cursor, the background color of the cursor
	  is now correctly applied (Brian Hsu).
	* Fixed issue in transparency. Fixes #269 (Sebastian Geiger).
	* Fixed a resize issue in fullscreen mode. Fixes #306 (Sebastian Geiger).
	* Tilda now uses asynchronous command spawning. A new option supports
	  changing the default timeout when spawning a command
	  (default is 3 seconds) (Sebastian Geiger).
	* Various fixes related to the window title. Tooltips now display
	  full tab title (Tom Briden). Fixed missing title on initial window and
	  fixed a problem with setting the title when switching between tabs. Also
	  the computation of the title is now more consistent between the window
	  title, tooltips and the tab title (Sebastian Geiger).
	* When loading configuration files tilda follows symlinks.
	  Fixes #327 (Sebastian Geiger).
	* Tilda now uses xdg-open to open web links rather
	  than x-www-browser (lucasbru).
	* In non-X11 environments such as Wayland tilda will now always use the
	  X11 backend (Roman Hoellen).
	* Exclamation mark '!' is now supported by the HTTP regex for detecting
	  web links.
	* Added a check if lock dir exists which avoids a warning when tilda
	  starts the first time and the lock dir has not been created yet
	  (Sebastian Geiger).
	* We now correctly free the resources when closing the a terminal tab
	  (Sebastian Geiger).
	* Tilda now uses structured logging. In debug mode tilda will automatically
	  output all debug messages. In non-debug mode, debug messages can still
	  be output by exporting G_MESSAGES_DEBUG=tilda (Sebastian Geiger).
	* Removed 'Allow Bold' option (Sebastian Geiger).
	* Removed deprecated antialiasing option (Sebastian Geiger).
	* Dropped support for older VTE versions (Sebastian Geiger).
