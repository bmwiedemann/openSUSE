  <title>A Super Mario Brothers Fan game engine (SMBX)</title>
  <description>TheXTech is a free and open-source game engine for Mario-like
platforming games. There is a complete and extended source code
port of the Super Mario Bros. X 1.3 game engine (later just &quot;SMBX&quot;),
and its direct unofficial continuation after development halted in
the 2011th year. This engine preserves full compatibility with
levels and episodes made for the original SMBX game, including its
repacks. And it's allowed to create brand-new Levels, Episodes,
and content packs. Unlike the original SMBX game that depends on
Windows and x86, TheXTech can work on many operating systems
(including Linux distros, macOS, xBSD, Android, Haiku, etc.) and
processor architectures (including x86_64, ARM, PowerPC, MIPS, etc.).
