transmission-daemon was split into a sub-package with the necessary
mechanisms to run it as a standalone daemon through systemd (incl.
.service file).

By defaultx transmission only allows connections to the web interface
through 127.0.0.1:9091; The default peer port is 51413 (firewalled).
You are responsible to configure the firewall accordingly and secure
the daemon.
