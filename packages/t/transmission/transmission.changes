Thu Mar 16 07:00:14 UTC 2023 - Paolo Stivanin <info@paolostivanin.com>

- Update to 4.0.2:
  + Highlights:

      magnet links.
    - Fixed 4.0.0 bug where download speed limits were ignored for
      uTP peers.

      single-tracker private torrents.
  + All platforms:
    - Restored support for path.utf-8 keys in torrent info dictionaries.
    - Fixed value of TR_TIME_LOCALTIME environment variable in
      torrent scripts.
    - Limited in-kernel file copying to 2 GiB blocks at a time to avoid

    - Many other fixes.
- Changes from version 4.0.0:
  + Added many performance improvements, and numerous bugfixes.
  + The entire codebase has been migrated from C to C++.
  + The remote control GUIs (transmission-qt and transmission-web)
    now use the RPC API "table" mode, resulting in smaller payloads
    / less bandwidth use.

  + The GTK client has been ported to gtkmm.
  + New Features:
    - Support for using BitTorrent v2 and hybrid torrents.

      announce all public torrents.
    - Newly-added seeds can start immediately and verify pieces on

      (e.g. User-Agent and date created) when creating new
      torrents.
    - The Web client has been rewritten and now supports mobile
      use.
    - When creating new torrents, users can now specify the piece
      size.
    - IPv6 blocklists are now supported.
    - Dozens of other new features.
  + Fix small scrape/announce packet size that could trip SYN flood
    detection on some systems.
  + Remove the 1024 open files limit previously required by how
    libcurl was used.
  + Add configurable anti-brute force settings.
  + Fetch metadata of stopped magnets.

  longer supported.
- Drop fdupes build requirement/macro. There isn't duplicate files
  anymore.
- Drop no longer needed %desktop_database_post and
  %icon_theme_cache_post macros targeted at pre-Leap openSUSE/SUSE
  releases.

- Refresh harden_transmission-daemon.service.patch patch with
  Quilt.
- Drop transmission-qt.desktop source file favoring the one
  provided by upstream.
- Add transmission.rpmlintrc file to filter the "file-not-in-%lang"
  warning, since we are excluding the English translations from the
  lang sub-packages and packaging them in the common sub-package
  instead.

Tue Oct 22 19:50:59 UTC 2019 - Bj√∏rn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

Wed Oct 10 08:08:56 UTC 2018 - Marguerite Su <i@marguerite.su>

- fix boo#1111323 transmission-qt try to load translations from /usr/bin
  + upstream issue#736 recommends to use cmake instead of autotools
    because codes related to autotools are deprecated. Nowadays
    we manually install transmission-qt translations into /usr/
    share/qt5/ directory where is designed for official Qt project
    only, while cmake will install to the right location /usr/share/
    transmission/translations.
  + switch build time configuration from autotools to cmake
- refactored transmission-appdata.patch to cmake-oriented.
  + handle transmission-gtk.appdata.xml translations with
    intltool-merge which is used by upstream for desktop files
    in gtk/CMakeLists.txt
  + handle transmission-qt.appdata.xml installation in
    qt/CMakeLists.txt instead of in specfile, because anyway
    we binary patch the -gtk.appdata.xml.in, we'd better not
    binary patch one while add another one as Source. so the
    SOURCE4 is also dropped.
- add transmission-3rdparty-no-download.patch
  + transmission's cmake configuration will download and build
    some 3rd-party libraries that could not be found in system.
    we patch its ExternalProject_Add() method to avoid the download
    because there are already source codes for such 3rd-party
    libraries located in third-party directory. Also, our OBS
    build machine doesn't support downloading in the build VM.
- mark COPYING with %license tag instead of %doc tag
- add extras/{rpc-spec.txt,send-email-when-torrent-done.sh}
  as doc since upstream installs them as doc too

    icons.

    packages.
