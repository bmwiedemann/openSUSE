PATCH-FIX-OPENSUSE
since upstream does not include this anymore
in latest https://github.com/TEIC/TEI.git

In our .spec %install section we call
make release
which copies all files listed into a directory called 'release'

We must not include 'release' in this list
because that creates non-determinism at build time due to
filesystem ordering and races between reader and writer processes
