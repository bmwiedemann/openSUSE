Fri Aug 29 07:11:29 UTC 2014 - multyrealm@gmail.com

- update to 2.0.3
  * Improvement:
    - Add `:save-display <file>` prompt command to save the current display.
    - Add `:script <file>` prompt command for scripting the Tig UI.
    - Add test framework and convert existing tests to use it.
    - Add command-line option for starting in refs view: `tig refs`. (GH #309)
    - Make blame commit ID colors stable across reloads. (GH #303)
    - Increase blame ID and graph rendering color palette to 14 colors.
    - New setting 'split-view-width' controls the width for vertical splits. It
      takes the width of the right-most view either as a number or a percentage.
    - Expose settings holding command line argument lists: `file-args`, `rev-args`,
      and `cmdline-args`. They are mainly intended for testing purposes but also
      allows to change the filtering arguments dynamically. (GH #306)
    - Add `log-options` setting for specifying default log view options.
      Example: `set log-options = --pretty=fuller`.
    - Use option specific view flags to reload view after `:set` commands.
  * Bug fixes:
    - Refresh the current view when returning from an external command and
      `refresh-mode=after-command`. (GH #289)
    - Fix readline completion.
    - Fix '/' to `find-next` when readline support is enabled. (GH #302)
    - Fix readline prompt to correctly handle UTF-8 characters.
    - Add warnings for more obsolete actions and colors.
    - Fix passing of commit IDS via stdin to the main view.
    - Fix commit title overflow drawing for multibyte text. (GH #307)
    - Fix installation directory permissions.
    - Handle binary files matches reported by git-grep.
    - Toggling of "args"-typed options without any arguments will clear the current
      arguments. Example: `:toggle blame-options`.
    - Detect custom `pretty.format` settings that break the log view and fallback
      to use the `medium` format. (GH #225)
    - Fix invocation of git-diff for the blame view's line tracking. (GH #316)
    - Fix blame completion of directory names. (GH #317)
    - Fix display of conflicts in the main view when 'show-changes' is enabled.
    - Fix off-by-one error when displaying line numbers in the grep view.
    - When showing the commit graph ensure that either topo, date or author-date
      commit order is used. (Debian #757692) (GH #238)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat May 31 19:13:19 UTC 2014 - bernhard@bwalle.de

- update to 2.0.2
  * Improvements
    - Use git-status for diffing the index.
    - Group toggle options together in the help view.
  * Bug fixes
    - Fix refs, main and grep loading when gui.encoding is set.
    - Ignore gui.encoding and i18n.commitencoding when set to UTF-8.
    - Add work-around for missing strndup() on Mac OS X v10.6.
    - Fix spurious abbreviation of author names.
    - Don't show empty action groups in the help view. 
- update to 2.0.1
  * Bug fixes:
    - Fix compilation in watch.c.
    - Fix parsing of key bindings mapped to ^ and <.
- update to 2.0
  * Incompatibilities
    - In preparation for key combo support, key mappings for symbolic
      keys (e.g. Up and Down) must now start with < and end with >,
      e.g. <Up> and <Down>.  Furthermore, escape key combos must
      now use <Esc>key instead of ^[key, and control key mappings
      must now use <Ctrl-key> instead of ^key.
    - Only use diff-options for the diff view and introduce
      %(cmdlineargs) to hold non-file and non-revision flags passed
      on the command line. Affects all user-defined commands that
      expect %(diffargs) to hold both diff-options arguments and
      those passed on the command line.
    - Remove built-in keybinding for git gc. Add the following line
      to ~/.tigrc to restore it: bind generic G ?git gc.
    - To support view specific colors, . can no longer be used
      interchangeably with - and _ in settings names and in particular
      color names.
    - Replace stage-next action with prompt command using a predefined
      search (see below) and add binding (@ by default) to also work
      in the diff view.
    - Most view display options must now be set via the new *-view
      options in tigrc. Existing options are no longer recognized,
      but a warning is shown.
    - Remap default bindings to have more consistent convention:
      use lower-case keys primarily for view switching and
      non-destructive actions, use upper-case keys for view-specific
      actions including user-defined commands. To preserve old default
      key bindings see contrib/bindings-v1.x.tigrc.
  * Improvements
    - Add mouse support: scroll view, click line to move cursor, double
      click line (or click again) to "Enter" cursor line, e.g. open
      commit diff. Disabled by default, since it makes text selection
      less intuitive. If you enable this remember to hold down Shift
      (or Option on Mac) when selecting text.
    - Rewrite and improve the rendering of the commit graph.
    - Add completion and history support to the prompt via readline.
    - Options can be configured and toggled individually for each view.
      Use the new view settings to configure the order and display
      options for each view columns. See system tigrc and tigrc(5) for
      examples.
    - Add grep view as a front-end to git-grep(1): tig grep -p strchr.
      From within Tig, the key for switching or grepping is bound to g
      by default.
    - Rename branch view to refs view and show tags. (GH #134)
    - Add main view pager mode that reads git-log’s --pretty=raw data
      from stdin, e.g. git reflog --pretty=raw | tig --pretty=raw.
    - Add support for --graph and highlight diff stats in the log view.
    - Add default command bindings: ! to delete branch, ! to drop stash.
    - Add stage-split-chunk action for splitting chunks in the stage
      view. Bound to \ by default.
    - Add back action bound to < by default, which will return the blame
      view to the previous revision and line after moving e.g. to the 
      parent.
    - Auto-refresh views based on watched repository changes. Configure
      by setting refresh-mode to manual, auto, after-command, or periodic.
    - All default settings are in well-documented system tigrc.
    - Add :toggle prompt command to manipulate options using keybindings.
      For example: bind diff D :toggle diff-options --patience --notes.
    - Add a new "auto" value for the vertical-split option to let Tig
      choose the split orientation (this is the new default behavior).
      Can be toggled.
    - Make it possible to toggle the display of files in untracked
      directories.
    - Allow Tig to be started with no default configuration by specifying
      an alternative system tigrc file, e.g.: TIGRC_SYSTEM=~/.tigrc.safe
      tig. Set TIGRC_SYSTEM to the empty string to use built-in
      configuration instead of
    - Key mappings can contain UTF-8 multibyte unicode keys.
    - Warn about conflicting keybindings using Ctrl, e.g. <Ctrl-f> and
      <Ctrl-F>.
    - Extend key bindings for prompt commands (ie. bind <keymap> <key>
      :<prompt>) to support predefined searches, eg.: bind stage 2 :?^@@.
    - Git color mappings can be configured in tigrc.
    - More informative configuration error messages.
    - Make reference label formatting configurable, for example:
      set reference-format = (branch) <tags> remote.
    - Adjust author width and other view columns automatically.
    - Support view specific colors: color stage.diff-add yellow default.
    - Copy -S, -G and --grep= pattern to search buffer so find-next and
      find-prev work as expected.
    - Optionally specify custom prompt for %(prompt) in shell commands,
      e.g. bind main B ?git checkout -b "%(prompt Enter new branch name: )".
    - Add %(remote) and %(tag) symbols to complement %(branch).
    - User-defined commands can now be prefixed with any of the supported
      flags, e.g. ?git checkout -b %(branch).
    - Open editor at line number for combined diffs e.g. diffs of unmerged files.
    - Add build configuration for Cygwin (OS name: CYGWIN_NT-6.1).
    - Document the Git commands supported by the pager mode. system
      tigrc configuration.
  * Bug fixes
    - Fix stash diff display when reloading the stash view after a deleting.
    - Set the commit reference when opening the blame view from the blob view.
    - Correctly identify and highlight the remote branch tracked by HEAD.

Sat Oct 13 19:01:33 CST 2012 - douglarek@outlook.com

- Updated to 1.1

    Incompatibilities:

     - Disable diff move/copy detection by default, boosting diff
       performance on larger projects. Use git config 'diff.renames' option
       (git-wide) to set your preferred behavior. Environment variable
       TIG_DIFF_OPTS can be used to restore the old behavior.
     - Values set for author-width and filename-width will result in widths
       one character bigger than previously.

    Improvements:

     - Typing a text in the prompt will be interpreted as a tig command.
       Prefixing the command with a '!' will execute this system command in
       an external pager. Entering a single key will execute the
       corresponding key binding.
     - Basic support for wrapping long line in pager, diff, and stage views.
       Enable using: `set wrap-lines = yes`. (GH #2)
     - User-defined commands prefixed with a '?' means prompt before
       execution. Example: `bind main B !?git rebase -i %(commit)`.
     - User-defined commands prefixed with a '<' means exit after execution.
       Example: `bind main C !<git commit`. (GH #66)
     - User-defined commands are executed unquoted to support shell commands.
       Example: `bind generic I !@sh -c "echo -n %(commit) | xclip -selection c"`.
       (GH #65)
     - Configure case-insensitive searches using: `set ignore-case = yes`.
     - Add "deleted mode" line type for better diff coloring.
     - Open editor when requesting edit action from within a file diff.
     - Update AX_WITH_CURSES to build under Cygwin.
     - Improve tigrc(5) documentation. (Debian #682766)
     - Allow to build on Mac OS 10.7 without the configure script. (GH #25)
     - Add option to split the view vertically instead of horizontally.
       Example: `set vertical-split = yes'. (GH #76)
     - Add 'show-id' and 'id-width' options to configure the display of
       commit IDs in the main view and ID width in the blame view. (GH #77)
     - Allow to override git-based encoding to UTF-8 by setting
       'i18n.commitencoding' or 'gui.encoding'.
     - Improve autobuild support to track generated files and work with
       autoreconf 2.61.
     - Commit IDs are read from stdin when --stdin is given; works for main
       and diff view, e.g. `tig --no-walk --stdin < cherry-picks.txt`.
     - Add option to disable focusing of the child view when it's opened.
       Disable using: `set focus-child = no`. (GH #83)
     - Allow to open blob related with added content in a diff. (GH #91)

    Bug fixes:

     - Fix commit graph regression when a path spec is specified. (GH #53)
     - Main view: only show staged/unstaged changes for the current branch.
     - Support submodules created with current version of git. (GH #54)
     - Fix diff status message for file diffs with no content changes.
     - Fix parent blaming when tig is launched in subdirectory. (GH #70)
     - Do not show deleted branch when reloading the branch view.

  * Use per-file encoding specified in gitattributes(5) for blobs and
    unstaged files.
  * Obsolete commit-encoding option and pass --encoding=UTF-8 to revision
    commands.
  * Main view: show uncommitted changes as staged/unstaged commits.
    Can be disabled by putting `set show-changes = no` in ~/.tigrc.
  * Add %(prompt) external command variable, which will prompt for the
    argument value.
  * Log information about git commands when the TIG_TRACE environment
    variable is set. Example: `TIG_TRACE=/tmp/tig.log tig`
  * Branch view: Show the title of the last commit.
  * Increase the author auto-abbreviation threshold to 10. (GH #49)
  * For old commits show number of years in relative dates. (GH #50)

- update to 0.16.2

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun 14 08:49:02 UTC 2010 - bernhard@bwalle.de

- update to 0.16
  o Incompatibilities:
    - Encode everything internally as UTF-8. This can affect
      performance, but should in general improve handling of
      character lengths etc. Also, to properly handle UTF-8
      environments use ncurses with wide character support.
    - The use of TIG_{MAIN,DIFF,LOG,TREE,BLOB}_CMD environment
      variables has been deprecated. To allow configuration of the
      diff view, TIG_DIFF_OPTS can be used.
  o Improvements:
    - Plug several memory leaks.
    - Command line arguments are split into diff, revision, and
      file arguments and made available as %(diffargs), %(revargs),
      and %(fileargs). Diff view will limit diffs using %(fileargs).
    - Status view: update the file variable when a line is selected
      so %(file) works as expected.
    - Branch view: add %(branch) symbol providing access to the
      selected branch.
    - Branch view: add entry to browse all branches (uses git-log’s
      --all flag).
    - Abbreviation of author names can now be configured and
      toggled.
    - Mark detached heads with [HEAD].
    - Add support for displaying dates in local time.
  o Bug fixes:
    - Status view: fix usage from sub directories, which was broken
      by the changes made to support blame view from sub
      directories.
    - Fix text expansion to not truncate long lines
    - Fix parsing of boolean show-date values.
    - Fix relative date.
    - Fix unbind to behave as if the keybinding was never defined.
    - Fix unbind to also cover built-in run requests.
    - Fix parsing of unknown keymap names.
    - Blame view: fix parent blame to detect renames. It uses
      "previous" line info from the blame porcelain output added in
      git version 1.6.3.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Dec 13 22:12:44 CET 2009 - bernhard@bwalle.de

- update to 0.15
  o Incompatibilities
    - Setting the cursor color no longer automatically sets the
      text to bold. The old lazy behavior was a bug.
    - Remove check for git-repo-config, which was officially
      deprecated in git version 1.5.4.
  o Improvements
    - Provide the manual as a man page named tigmanual(7).
    - Add ability to toggle between showing shorter dates (without
      time info) and relative dates.
    - Show the active (instead of the default) keybindings in the
      help view.
    - Add branch view for choosing which branch to display in the
      main view.

    - Make height of the lower view in a split view configurable
      by setting the split-view-height variable to a number or a
      percentage.
    - Allow multiple text attributes for color commands:
      color cursor white blue underline bold
  o Bug fixes
    - Blame view: fix loading of blame data when opened from the
      tree view and CWD is not the repo root.
    - Tree view: fix searching.
