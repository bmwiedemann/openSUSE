  <title>An ncurses-based text-mode interface for git</title>
  <description>Tig is an ncurses-based text-mode interface for git. It allows you to
browse changes in a git repository and can additionally act as a pager
for output of various git commands. When used as a pager, it will
display input from stdin and colorize it.

When browsing repositories, tig uses the underlying git commands to
present the user with various views, such as summarized commit log and
showing the commit with the log message, diffstat, and the diff.</description>
