%description
Tig is a git repository browser that additionally can act as a pager
for output from various git commands.

When browsing repositories, it uses the underlying git commands to
present the user with various views, such as summarized revision log
and showing the commit with the log message, diffstat, and the diff.

Using it as a pager, it will display input from stdin and colorize it.
