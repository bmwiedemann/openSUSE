- Update to version 0.8
  Backwards incompatibility with variants:
  * The FUSE overlay variants have been removed in favor of
    explicit variants. If you use variants on version v0.7.11 or
    earlier, you may need to update your Tupfiles. See
    https://gittup.org/tup/ex_explicit_variants.html for more
    details.
  New features:
  * 'import' keyword to set a Tupfile variable to an environment
    variable.
  * 'tup compiledb' can create a compile_commands.json for
    third-party tools to see compilation commands.
  * 'tup commandline' shows the commandline used to compile a
    file.
  * 'tup generate' can support building in a separate build
    directory (if the project supports building with variants).
  * 'tup generate' can take an output list to limit what the
    script generates (ie: a partial build script).
  * A single Lua state is now re-used during parsing and doesn't
    need to be reinitialized for every Lua-based Tupfile.
  * Internal mtime tracking is now at nanosecond resolution
    (where supported by the OS) instead of 1-second intervals.
  Dependency updates:
  * Internal Lua version is now 5.4.6
  * Internal SQLite version is now 3.45.2
  * Internal PCRE version is now PCRE2 10.42
  * External PCRE dependency is now libpcre2 instead of libpcre
    (default unless built with CONFIG_TUP_USE_SYSTEM_PCRE=n in
    which case the internal version is used)
  Bug fixes:
  * Fixed a bug that results in tup_entry_rm called on tupid X,
    which still has refcount=1
  * ^o rules that fail with a monitor autoupdate no longer cause
    infinite loops
  * Deleted files are now removed from the transient_list.
- Drop tup-add_archs.patch (no longer necessary)
- Drop tup.rpmlintrc

Sat May 15 19:18:48 UTC 2021 - Luigi Baldoni <aloisio@gmx.com>

- Update to version 0.7.11
  New features:
  * ^t flag can be used to mark commands with "transient"
    outputs. These outputs are removed after all dependent
    commands have been processed. (See the manual for details if
    you think this will be useful for you)
  * Internal lua version is now 5.4.3
  Bug fixes:
  * Environment variable changes now show in --debug-logging logs
  * Including a lua file from a regular Tupfile no longer breaks
    updating variables with +=
  * Tup now detects if it is running inside of Conemu's
    dependency injection and issues a warning
  * Changing external files now correctly re-parses if
    full_deps=1 (thanks alightr!)
  * 'tup varsed' now works inside a 'tup generate' script
  * Fixes to the progress bar that sometimes showed a non-zero
    ending state.
  * Argument ordering for partial updates is no longer strict
    (both 'tup filename -k' and 'tup -k filename' should work to
    update filename with the keep-going flag enabled).
- Drop tup-32bit.patch (merged upstream)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct 30 14:41:40 UTC 2020 - Luigi Baldoni <aloisio@gmx.com>

- Update to version 0.7.10
  * Fixed several 'tup version' issues with bootstrapped or
    non-git tup
  * Fixed an error in setting PGID for subprocesses
  * Fixed a few issues with generated files that become normal
    (user-created) files
  * Improvements to 'tup generate' build scripts
  * Now uses fuse3 by default, though fuse2 should still work.
    (Setting CONFIG_TUP_SERVER=fuse in tup.config will use
    fuse2 when building tup)
- Refreshed tup-add_archs.patch
- Added tup-32bit.patch

Sat Jun 13 12:52:31 UTC 2020 - Luigi Baldoni <aloisio@gmx.com>

Fri Sep 28 05:52:34 UTC 2018 - Luigi Baldoni <aloisio@gmx.com>

- Update to version 0.7.8
  * Fix to support ccache better
  * Fixes to support icecream better
  * Improvements to %i, %#b, and %#B handling
  * Initial support for ignoring unpredictable outputs
    (https://github.com/gittup/tup/issues/182)
  * Now depends on libpcre, unless tup.config contains
    CONFIG_TUP_USE_SYSTEM_PCRE=n

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jul 28 07:08:02 UTC 2018 - aloisio@gmx.com

- Update to version 0.7.7
  * Added --debug-logging flag to save build DAGs and file changes
    in .tup/log/
  * Minor bug fixes:
    + LD_PRELOAD dependency checker (now works with clang)
    + Outputs in other directories don't continually reparse if
      the outputs aren't built yet
    + Windows local build issues
    + Partial updates for groups now build dependent groups
    + Partial updates now correctly clear the modify flag on
      normal files
