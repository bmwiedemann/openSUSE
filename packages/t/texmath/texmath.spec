%description
The texmath library provides functions to read and write TeX math, presentation
MathML, and OMML (Office Math Markup Language, used in Microsoft Office).
Support is also included for converting math formats to Gnu eqn and to pandoc's
native format (allowing conversion, via pandoc, to a variety of different
markup formats). The TeX reader supports basic LaTeX and AMS extensions, and it
can parse and apply LaTeX macros. (See <http://johnmacfarlane.net/texmath here>
for a live demo of bidirectional conversion between LaTeX and MathML.)

The package also includes several utility modules which may be useful for
anyone looking to manipulate either TeX math or MathML. For example, a copy of
the MathML operator dictionary is included.

Use the 'executable' flag to install a standalone executable, 'texmath', that
by default reads a LaTeX formula from 'stdin' and writes MathML to 'stdout'.
With flags all the functionality exposed by 'Text.TeXMath' can be accessed
through this executable. (Use the '--help' flag for a description of all
functionality)

The 'texmath' executable can also be used as a CGI script, when renamed as
'texmath-cgi'. It will expect query parameters for 'from', 'to', 'input', and
optionally 'inline', and return a JSON object with either 'error' and a message
or 'success' and the converted result.
