  <title>Grand Unified Boot Loader with TPM support</title>
  <description>GNU GRUB is a multiboot boot loader. It was derived from GRUB. It is an
attempt to produce a boot loader for IBM PC-compatible machines that
has both the ability to be friendly to beginning or otherwise
nontechnically interested users and the flexibility to help experts in
diverse environments. It is compatible with Free/Net/OpenBSD and Linux.
It supports Win 9x/NT and OS/2 via chainloaders. It has a menu
interface and a command line interface.

Trusted GRUB is the continuation of the 1.0 GRUB series, introducing
support for Trusted Platform Modules. This means that it simply records
the configuration of the files used for booting in the TPM for later
verification.</description>
