-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 16 18:24:09 UTC 2011 - fcrozat@novell.com

- Update to version 0.13.18:
  + Previously, tp_clear_object (NULL), tp_clear_boxed (type, NULL)
    and tp_clear_pointer (NULL) were no-ops. However, this
    behaviour was not very useful‚Äîthese functions are always called
    as tp_clear_object (&priv->foo) in practice‚Äîand triggered
    compiler warnings (because these are actually implemented as
    macros). Thus, this usage is no longer supported.
  + Fixes:
    - TpCMMessage is no longer included in the .gir file. This
      class is only useful in CMs; we only support client-side API
      in the .gir file.
    - Correctly include TpBasePasswordChannel documentation.
    - Fix GCC 4.6 and Clang analyzer warnings
- Changes from version 0.13.17:

      tp_connection_get_connection_manager_name() and
      tp_connection_get_protocol_name(), allow you to grab these
      properties from a TpConnection without having to drive
      tp_connection_parse_object_path() yourself.
    - GBinding utilities for connection-status on TpAccount and
      TpConnection:
      tp_connection_bind_connection_status_to_property() and
      tp_account_bind_connection_status_to_property().
    - TpTextChannel now has a "message-types" property and
      accessor. It also gained
      tp_text_channel_supports_message_type() a convenient
      function to check if a specific message type is supported.
    - TpContactSearch: only close channels if there was an error
    - TpBaseClient gained
      tp_base_client_set_observer_delay_approvers() which can be
      used to indicate that an Observer has to block Approvers.

  + Enhancements:
    - TpContact now supports modifying the contact's groups on
      connection managers which implement
      Connection.Interface.ContactGroups.
    - It's now possible to get a list of TpChannelRequest objects
      from a TpObserveChannelsContext or TpHandleChannelsContext;
      adding hints to channel requests, and retrieving them again,
      is supported with telepathy-mission-control ‚â• 5.7.2.
    - tp_account_channel_request_create_and_observe_channel_async()
      and friends, analogous to
      tp_account_channel_request_create_and_handle_channel_async()
      but for Observers rather than Handlers, have been added.
    - Code is now generated to emit and listen for the
      PropertiesChanged signal on org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties.
      Note that TpDBusPropertiesMixin does not emit this signal on
      it own, nor does TpProxy listen for it of its own accord.
    - tp_capabilities_supports_room_list(), a convenient way to
      check whether a connection supports listing chat rooms, has
      been added.
  + Fixes:
    - Including telepathy-glib/protocol.h now correctly includes
      generated client-side functions.
- Changes from version 0.13.13:
  + Many doc fixes
  + Compiler flags reordered (clang is order-sensitive) to allow
    static analysis.
  + Account Channel Requests now give you access to the originating
    TpChannelRequest.
  + The speculative debug cache may now be disabled at compile time.
- Changes from version 0.13.12:
  + Enhancements:
    - TpContact now tracks incoming and outgoing presence
      subscriptions, albeit only if the connection implements the
      new Connection.Interface.ContactList API.
    - Code is generated for new API added in telepathy-spec
      version 0.21.9; specifically, the FileTransfer.URI property
      is supported.
    - TpPresenceMixinStatusAvailableFunc, which has confused many
      a CM author, now has clearer documentation.
  + Fixes:
    - We no longer accidentally depend on GLib 2.28.
    - tests/contact-search-result no longer fails on x86.
- Changes from version 0.13.11:
  + Enhancements:
    - fdo#32053: The TpContactSearch object has been added. It
      represents ongoing searches for contacts.
  + Fixes:
    - fdo#32551: tp_base_client_set_observer_recover now works
      with all possible gboolean arguments!
    - tp_debug_timestamped_log_handler will now print the message
      and not just the time, which was broken over a year ago.
    - TpProtocol will now consider a manager file's
      AuthenticationTypes value.
- Change vala-devel BuildRequires to vala-unstable-devel.

      passed to tp_g_signal_connect_object
  + Updated to spec 0.21.8.
    - The ContactList.ContactsChangedWithID signal was added. It's
      automatically emitted by TpBaseContactList, so CMs don't
      need to make any changes to take advantage of it.
  + Fixes:
    - tp_account_manager_ensure_account() no longer criticals if
      you pass it a malformed account path.
    - TpBaseClient will now return (an error) from ObserveChannels
      if an invalid connection path is passed to it by the Channel
      Dispatcher.
    - fdo#32184: Connection bus names are no longer erroneously
      released while connections are still open. This was a
      regression in 0.13.5.
    - fdo#32423: Preparing TpAccount features when the CORE
      feature is already prepared now works
    - fdo#32391: correctly deal with removing name owner watches
      during dispatch of their callbacks
    - Documentation improvements
    - TpBaseClient no longer breaks if HandleChannels is called
      more than once for the same channel. This was a regression

  + Deprecations:
    - tp_message_new (replace with tp_cm_message_new)
    - tp_message_ref_handle (no longer needed)

- Update to version 0.10.3:
  + Fixes:
    - Don't fail 'make check' if gtk-doc complains that the
      documentation is incomplete, since this is a stable branch,
      but gtk-doc's definition of "complete" changes from release
      to release
    - Don't warn/error if we're using deprecated functions, since
      this is a stable branch, so it's not going to be fixed here

    - Add tp_g_signal_connect_object, a non-leaky version of
      g_signal_connect_object
    - fdo#25283: add constants for namespaced D-Bus property names,
      such as TP_PROP_CHANNEL_CHANNEL_TYPE
    - fdo#25235: add <telepathy-glib/telepathy-glib.h> which
      includes the most commonly-used headers
  + Fixes:

      compilers
    - fdo#25121: fix failure to link when -Wl,--no-add-needed is

      binutils-gold (deb#556486)
    - Fix various coverity nits, including a missing call to
      va_end, and a typo in the documentation
    - fdo#25359: alter code generation to cope with arbitrary UTF-8
      in the spec

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Nov 14 01:39:33 CET 2009 - vuntz@opensuse.org

- Update to version 0.9.1:
  + Fixes:
    - Corrected the GLib dependency to 2.20
    - Corrected the error message given when a write-only D-Bus
      property is read
    - Work around GLib 2.20 being less const-correct than 2.22
    - fdo#23853: if a connection manager is discovered not to be
      running while TpConnectionManager has a ListProtocols call
      in-flight, then a new instance of the CM starts up and
      replies to that call, don't crash with an assertion failure
    - If a connection manager returns error from GetParameters(),
      don't dereference a NULL pointer and segfault
    - When asked to activate or introspect a connection manager,
      don't do anything until we have at least worked out whether
      it was initially running, in order to provide the documented
      behaviour
    - When getting parameter details from a running connection
      manager, consider parameters called "password" or ending with
      "-password" to be secret even if they lack the SECRET flag,
      as was already done when reading .manager files
- Changes from version 0.9.0:
  + Dependencies:
    - GLib 2.20 is now required.
    - telepathy-glib now links to GIO as well as GLib and GObject.

      libempathy's
    - telepathy-glib now uses Automake 1.11's "silent rules"
      feature for kernel-style output.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 28 16:53:32 CEST 2009 - vuntz@opensuse.org

    - Set the debug domain for telepathy-glib to tp-glib/$category,
      e.g.  tp-glib/connection for TpConnection and TpBaseConnection
  + Fixes:
   - fdo#23843: make tp_debug_sender_log_handler with exclude=NULL
     include everything, rather than nothing

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep  4 14:00:53 CEST 2009 - vuntz@novell.com

- Update to version 0.7.36:
  + Enhancements:
    - Add TpDebugSender, along with the lower-level TpSvcDebug
      interface that it uses
    - Clarify when tp_proxy_signal_connection_disconnect is safe to
      call
    - Add support for simulating DTMF and Hold support in the
      'callable' example connection manager
    - fdo#21327: truncate the ChangeLog at version 0.6 to stop it
      being so huge, and force ISO date format
  + Fixes:
    - If the bus name for a Connection would be too long, hash the
      unique name provided by the CM, instead of crashing
    - fdo#23524: don't introspect a TpConnectionManager twice in
      parallel, avoiding an assertion failure
    - TpChannel: don't disconnect from a TpProxySignalConnection
      that's already gone, fixing a crash
    - tp_connection_manager_idle_read_manager_file: avoid using the
      TpConnectionManager after it may have been disposed
    - TpBaseConnection: Allow GetInterfaces() to succeed before
      CONNECTED

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug 25 13:50:54 CEST 2009 - vuntz@novell.com

- Update to version 0.7.35:
  + API changes:
    - fdo#17751: TpBaseConnection no longer guarantees that the
      self-handle is set to 0 when the state changes to
      DISCONNECTED; instead, the self-handle remains valid until
      the connection is disposed, so that connection managers can
      use it during teardown.
  + Enhancements:
    - Add tp_dbus_daemon_list_names() and
      tp_dbus_daemon_list_activatable_names(), which are more
      efficient (and more const-correct) versions of the
      corresponding autogenerated tp_cli_dbus_daemon methods
    - Support the Hold interface in the "callable" example CM
  + Fixes:
    - Finally make tp_dbus_daemon_watch_name_owner bind to
      NameOwnerChanged selectively, for reduced wakeups.
    - Fix a memory leak in tp_dbus_daemon_watch_name_owner
    - fdo#9812: TpDynamicHandleRepo: use
      tp_dbus_daemon_watch_name_owner for reduced wakeups
    - In TpDynamicHandleRepo, if a client holds handles then
      immediately crashes, release those handles as soon as we find
      out that it's gone
    - fdo#22957: fix compilation in some non-gcc compilers
    - As per telepathy-spec 0.17.27, represent connection status
      reason NAME_IN_USE as TP_ERROR_CONNECTION_REPLACED or
      TP_ERROR_ALREADY_CONNECTED (as appropriate), not as
      TP_ERROR_NOT_YOURS, so that NotYours can safely be given
      special handling
- Changes from version 0.7.34:
  + Enhancements:
    - Updated to telepathy-spec 0.17.27
      * generate code for Connection.Interface.Location
      * omit Debug interface from code-generation for now: it will
        be enabled in a future release when we have reference
        client- and service-side implementations (possibly called
        TpDebugReceiver and TpDebugSender)
      * add more errors
      * generate code for Handler.Capabilities property
    - Add macros for static assertions (tp_verify, tp_verify_true,
      tp_verify_statement) to util.h
    - Make the allocation model for
      tp_dbus_properties_mixin_make_properties_hash part of our ABI
      guarantee
    - Add a GType macro TP_ARRAY_TYPE_OBJECT_PATH_LIST
  + Fixes:
    - fdo#23164: don't unref a NULL DBusMessage
    - Get tp_intset_iter_init and tp_intset_iter_reset into the
      documentation
    - Make omitted CM parameters that have a default
      indistinguishable from explicitly-passed parameters with that
      value, removing the need to specify the default in the
      Connection as well
    - fdo#22889: reduce introspection round-trips
    - Fix header guard in debug.h
    - fdo#18091: for interfaces with D-Bus methods, document how to
      write a complete interface init function
    - Fix a rare crash when a TpProxyPendingCall is cancelled
      before the DBusGProxyCall is provided

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul 20 01:03:34 CEST 2009 - vuntz@novell.com

- Update to version 0.7.33:
  + Fixed a test failure in test-params-cm on certain
    architectures, including powerpc and sparc
  + Fixed an assertion failure in TpConnection if StatusChanged to
    CONNECTED is followed immdiately by GetStatus returning
    CONNECTED

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jun 13 15:24:36 CEST 2009 - vuntz@novell.com

- Update to version 0.7.32:
  + Enhancements:
    - fdo#22208: Updated to telepathy-spec 0.17.26
    - Added generated service-side bindings for AccountManager,
      Account, ChannelDispatcher, ChannelDispatchOperation,
      ChannelRequest and Client - Added minimal versions of
      TpAccountManager, TpAccount,
      TpChannelDispatcher, TpChannelDispatchOperation,
      TpChannelRequest and TpClient
    - fdo#22205: Added support for deprecating or removing _run_
      methods in code generation
    - Added flymake support
    - fdo#22230: Added support for byte ('y') parameters to CMs
  + Fixes:
    - Made sure _gen/error-str.h and .c end with a newline, fixing
      compilation with certain compilers
    - fdo#19741: Documented client-side handle reference counting
    - fdo#21977: Removed duplicate mention of media-interfaces.h in
      Makefile.am
    - fdo#22121: made tp_channel_dispose properly idempotent
    - Removed dead code for introspecting alias flags
    - fdo#22182: Fixed a potential use-after-free in the callable
      example CM
  + Release notes for projects using code generation:
    - After updating to this version of glib-client-gen.py, _run_
      methods will no longer be generated by default. To get the
      behaviour of older versions, run it with the new
      --generate-reentrant option; to get the methods present but
      deprecated, use an option like
      --deprecate-reentrant=FOO_DISABLE_DEPRECATED (which means the
      _run_ methods are marked with G_GNUC_DEPRECATED, and will not
      be available at all if FOO_DISABLE_DEPRECATED is defined).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 27 19:49:58 CEST 2009 - vuntz@novell.com

- Update to version 0.7.31:
  + Enhancements:
    - Added TP_ERROR_STR_* constants corresponding to the members
      of the TpError enum, and tp_error_get_dbus_name() mapping the
      latter to the former
    - Updated to telepathy-spec 0.17.25, adding ConnectionRefused,
      ConnectionFailed and ConnectionLost errors, and the new-style
      StreamTube and DBusTube channel types
    - Made tp_g_key_file_get_int64 and _uint64 into public API for
      Mission Control's benefit
  + Fixes:
    - Changed the dbus_daemon member of TpProxy to be removed in
      dispose, rather than just after the invalidated signal
    - Fixed a null pointer dereference if a TpConnectionManager is
      resurrected during dispose
    - Fixed a use-after-free when the user-supplied object in
      tp_connection_manager_call_when_ready is destroyed after the
      CM becomes ready
    - Fixed tp_dbus_daemon_request_name,
      tp_dbus_daemon_release_name and
      _tp_dbus_daemon_get_name_owner to fail gracefully if the
      TpDBusDaemon has been invalidated

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May 19 05:19:38 CEST 2009 - vuntz@novell.com

- Update to version 0.7.30:
  + API changes:
    - tp_proxy_add_interface_by_id() may not be called on an
      invalidated proxy. (It never made sense to do this, but now
      telepathy-glib will complain if you do.)
  + Enhancements:
    - Added tp_dbus_daemon_request_name() and
      tp_dbus_daemon_release_name(). (Fixes fdo#21771.)
    - Update to telepathy-spec 0.17.23, adding the Terminated
      error.
    - Added optional support for Shave, to give kernel-style pretty
      make output. (This is disabled by default; to enable it, pass
      --enable-shave to configure.)
    - Channel introspection will now fail more quickly when the
      channel is invalidated.
  + Fixes:
    - Generated GInterfaces now install type information sooner,
      fixing a bug where object construction could make dbus-glib
      assert.
  + fdo#21792:
    tp_presence_mixin_simple_presence_fill_contact_attributes
    asserts if get_contact_statuses returns NULL.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Apr  5 13:31:44 CEST 2009 - vuntz@novell.com

- Update to version 0.7.29:
  + Enhancements:
    - TpBaseConnectionManager, tp_cm_param_setter_offset: support
      parameters of various extra types - object path, double,
      64-bit signed and unsigned integer, array of strings, array
      of bytes - and add regression tests
    - TpContact: enhance documentation to spell out that change
      notification is via GObject::notify::alias etc.
    - tp_asv_new(), a shorthand for creating hash tables from
      strings to slice-allocated GValues, along with tp_asv_set_*
      and tp_asv_take_* helpers to add entries to such hash tables.
      (Fixes fdo#20942)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 25 14:21:34 CET 2009 - vuntz@novell.com

- Update to version 0.7.28:
  + API changes:
    - Use the prefix for D-Bus errors specified by telepathy-spec,
      not something telepathy-glib made up (changing .Errors to the
      correct .Error). This was a regression in telepathy-glib 0.7.1.
  + Enhancements:
    - Update to telepathy-spec 0.17.22, adding
      TP_ARRAY_TYPE_SOCKET_ADDRESS_IP_LIST,
      TP_ARRAY_TYPE_STRING_STRING_MAP_LIST,
      TP_STRUCT_TYPE_SOCKET_ADDRESS_IP
    - Extend the 'callable' example connection manager to support
      simulated incoming calls, support simulated contacts who
      never answer, are busy or terminate the call, and comply with
      telepathy-spec 0.17.22
  + Fixes:
    - fdo#20729: csh (chatroom) example connection manager: comply
      with telepathy-spec 0.17.21 by always allowing the user to
      leave the Group
    - Cancel GetParameters call if the CM crashes, fixing an
      assertion failure in
      tp_connection_manager_continue_introspection

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 18 14:34:42 CET 2009 - vuntz@novell.com

- Update to version 0.7.27:
  + Enhancements:
    - fdo#18220: make it much less verbose to construct
      string/variant maps (a{sv}) by adding functions like
      tp_g_value_slice_new_uint().
    - Make example connection managers installable (with
      --enable-installed-examples)
    - Add an example connection manager that has dummy
      StreamedMedia channels
    - Add an example connection manager that has dummy ContactList
      channels vaguely resembling the XMPP roster
    - Update to telepathy-spec 0.17.21 (adding
      TP_CHANNEL_GROUP_FLAG_MESSAGE_DEPART and
      TP_CHANNEL_MEDIA_CAPABILITY_NAT_TRAVERSAL_ICE_UDP)
  + Fixes:
    - fdo#20646: in TpChannel, when adding contacts to one of the
      Group sets, remove them from both of the others
    - Use AM_PATH_PYTHON to detect the Python version
    - In TpGroupMixin, let implementations allow the self-handle to
      be removed regardless of whether the CAN_REMOVE flag is set.
    - fdo#20165: fix a use-after-free in
      tp_base_connection_register() that causes connection managers
      to assert if they have not already called
      tp_dbus_daemon_dup() or tp_run_connection_manager()
    - Fix some memory leaks when making TpContact objects, when
      holding handles in TpContactsMixin, when filling contact
      attributes in TpPresenceMixin, when setting simple presence,
      and in the regression tests
    - Update the valgrind suppressions file to cope with new
      telepathy-glib code, GTest, and glibc 2.9
    - Fix compilation with gtkdoc 1.11, which is stricter about the
      contents of Since: annotations, and parses more comments


-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb 17 03:36:55 CET 2009 - vuntz@novell.com

- Update to version 0.7.26:
  + Enhancements:
    - Add tp_connection_manager_call_when_ready()
    - When constructing TpConnectionManager, if the .manager file
      is missing or can't be read, always try to activate the
      connection manager (in practice, this is what's wanted)
    - fdo#18291: when listing connection managers, wait for them to
      all be ready
    - fdo#18056: add method-based accessors for TpConnectionManager
      members
    - fdo#17519: track the Connection's SelfHandle property in
      TpConnection

      starter-bus connection
    - Generate GTypes for arrays of mappings, and improve use of
      the type-generation functions
    - Add tp_intset_new_containing(), a convenient factory for sets
      with exactly one member
  + Deprecations:
    - Deprecate tp_get_bus_proxy()
  + Fixes:
    - Reduce our reliance on making a DBusGProxy for the
      dbus-daemon (working towards avoiding overly-broad
      NameOwnerChanged matches)
    - fdo#18832 (partially addressed): document that tp_get_bus()
      can call exit() and why, and discourage it in processes that
      aren't totally reliant on D-Bus
    - fdo#18207: reliably emit TpConnectionManager::got-info signal
      (although tp_connection_manager_call_when_ready() should be
      used instead)
    - Fix some assertion failures in TpConnectionManager when
      .manager files contain surprising types
    - Parse all currently supported types in .manager files
  + Miscellaneous:
    - Add regression test coverage for TpConnectionManager
- Remove .la file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Feb  1 18:23:47 EST 2009 - mboman@suse.de

- Update to version 0.7.25:
  + fdo#17588: don't break ABI if errors are re-ordered in a future spec
    version
  + fdo#19688: don't assert when getting contacts by ID if none of the
    identifiers supplied are valid
  + TpPresenceMixin: don't allow setting statuses that are flagged as not
    settable on the user themselves
  + TpPresenceMixin: never allow statuses of type OFFLINE, UNKNOWN or ERROR
    to be set on the user themselves, and warn if the connection manager
    got this wrong

    in the past, rather than crashing.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 12 16:57:13 EST 2009 - hfiguiere@suse.de

- Update to version 0.7.21
  + Updated to spec version 0.17.17
  + (Finally) merged TpMessageMixin, which can be used in place of TpTextMixin to
    implement the Messages interface on Text channels.
  + The examples have been made more exemplary.
  + Added a TP_COMPILER_WARNINGS macro to simplify choosing compiler warnings in
    configure.ac
  + Added support to TpGroupMixin for emitting the MembersChangedDetailed signal
    (fdo#19050 and fdo#19052), and to TpChannel for listening to it when possible
    (fdo#19051).
  + Added tp_channel_get_identifier
  + Added support for parsing the dbus-property CM parameter flag (introduced in
    spec 0.17.16) from .manager files (fdo#19053).
  + fdo#19101: tp_connection_get_contacts_by_id() crashes

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Oct 19 11:53:02 EST 2008 - mboman@suse.de

- Update to version 0.7.17:
  + Updated to spec 0.17.13, which adds Requested, InitiatorHandle and
    InitiatorID properties to Channel
  + Updated two example CMs (echo and channelspecific) to spec 0.17.13 too
  + Added handle reference-counting helpers, which should be used instead
    of using the HoldHandles, RequestHandles and ReleaseHandles D-Bus API
    directly
  + Added C accessors for TpProxy's read-only properties, and for
    TpConnection's connection-ready property
  + Added some infrastructure for test coverage analysis using lcov
  + Moved some of the release/checking machinery to tools/telepathy.am
    for easy pasting into other Telepathy projects
  + The first time TP_ERRORS is used, the error domain is now automatically
    registered with dbus-glib
  + Added sanity checks (g_return_if_fail/g_critical) to TpConnection,
    TpProxy, TpDBusDaemon and tp_dbus_check_* public API
  + tp_handle_is_valid and tp_handles_are_valid raise InvalidHandle on
    failure, not InvalidArgument (numerous methods in telepathy-spec require
    InvalidHandle to be raised, so this should make most CMs more
    spec-compliant)
  + The test and example CMs raise NotAvailable on syntactically incorrect
    strings, rather than InvalidArgument (which is not spec-compliant)
  + The example valgrind suppressions file now works if libdbus was not
    installed in /usr, or if glibc is version 2.7
  + fdo#17502: fixed documentation of the #include for TpDBusPropertiesMixin
  + Fixed a memory leak in TpContactsMixin

- Signed-off.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct  2 20:37:17 CEST 2008 - dominique-opensuse@leuenberger.net

- Update to version 0.7.16:
* We now support EnsureChannel on the Requests interface - to implement this,
  put a suitable function pointer in TpChannelManagerIface::ensure_channel
* Channel factories' RequestChannel implementations no longer need to
  validate handles - TpBaseConnection now does this automatically
* Added a function to compare presence types in order of "availability"

Fixes:
* The gtkdoc now documents GInterfaces' signals and properties (fd.o #16995,
  fd.o #17308)
* TpBaseConnection::self_handle is unreffed and cleared slightly later,
  for the benefit of channel managers that want to use it in their
  status-changed(Disconnected) callback
* Fixed a compiler warning on platforms with daemon(3) in their libc
* TpChannelManager can no longer be crashed by asking for unsupported
  handle types

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug 19 18:54:12 EDT 2008 - hfiguiere@suse.de

- Upgrade to 0.7.14
  * Updated to specification 0.17.9
  * Added TpContactsMixin, a generic implementation of the Contacts interface
  * Added tp_connection_get_status() convenience accessor for status and
    status-reason properties
  * Altered tp_debug_divert_messages() to support a "+" prefix to filenames,
    which changes the mode from truncate to append: you can now set something
    like GABBLE_LOGFILE="+gabble.log" to append to an existing log
