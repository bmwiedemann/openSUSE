  <title>Tcl Binding for the OpenSSL Library</title>
  <description>This extension provides a generic binding for Tcl to OpenSSL, utilizing
the new Tcl_StackChannel API for Tcl 8.2 and higher. The sockets behave
exactly the same as channels created using Tcl's built-in socket
command with additional options for controlling the SSL session.</description>
