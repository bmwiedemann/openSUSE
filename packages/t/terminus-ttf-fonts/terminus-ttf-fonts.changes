Sat May  7 07:12:54 UTC 2016 - sor.alexei@meowr.ru

- Update to version 4.40.1 (changes since 4.39):
  * Add 6 combining accents as separate characters.
  * Add 14 letters with dot above / dot below.
  * Add partial subscript and superscript: all digits and 11 letters.
  * Add 30+ math characters, notably large braces, brackets and parens.
  * Add unicode range 2800-28FF in two variants (br1 and br2).
  * A few small character fixes.
  * There now is a Bold Italic variant in order to satisfy some
    applications which refuse to treat Terminus TTF as monospaced
    unless that variant exists. It has the same drawbacks as the
    existing Italic variant: it is generated automatically by
    slanting the Bold variant of Terminus Font, so it is of lower
    quality than the Bold variant.
