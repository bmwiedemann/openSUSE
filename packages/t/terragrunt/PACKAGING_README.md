# Packaging terragrunt

terragrunt 0.58.4 changed the Makefile. Since then, the `mocks` need to be
prepared during build.
This also means, that vendoring fails without first creating the mocks...

1. Change the version in the `_service` file
3. Run `make`
4. Check the autogenerated changelog entry
5. Commit the changes as usual

For the OBS workflow you need `obs-service-tar_scm`.

For the `make` part you need `make` and a recent go installation.
