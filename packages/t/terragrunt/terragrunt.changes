- Update to version 0.99.2:
  * Bug Fixes
    - Interrupt signal propagation to OpenTofu/Terraform fixed
      The mechanism by which Terragrunt sends interrupt signals to
      OpenTofu/Terraform processes it started has been made more
      robust. Terragrunt will now send the interrupt signal in the
      event that a user explicitly sends an interrupt signal to
      Terragrunt in addition to scenarios where Terragrunt’s
      context cancellation is triggered (e.g. in the event of a
      timeout).
    - SOPS decryption race condition fixed
      A race condition in the concurrent access to SOPS decrypted
      secrets in different environments combined with usage of the
      --auth-provider-cmd flag resulted in authentication failures.
      Synchronization controls have been introduced to ensure
      authentication proceeds correctly for each environment
      independently.
  * What's Changed

Tue Jan 27 06:06:33 UTC 2026 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 0.99.0:
  * Breaking Changes
    - Undocumented behavior removed
      We have removed several undocumented features that served as
      temporary stop-gaps to facilitate experimentation.
      The following environment variables no longer affect
      Terragrunt behavior:
      - TERRAGRUNT_TEMP_QUOTE_NULL
      - TMP_UNDOCUMENTED_REPORT_PADDER
      - TMP_UNDOCUMENTED_REPORT_UNIT_COLORIZE
      - TMP_UNDOCUMENTED_COLORIZE_DEFAULT_SUMMARY_PADDING
    - Internal tflint deprecated
      Terragrunt has been shipping with a version of tflint
      compiled into the binary to allow for more convenient usage
      without installing tflint directly. However due to the
      adoption of a BUSL license in tflint, the version included in
      Terragrunt was frozen.
      We have now deprecated use of the internal tflint hook, and
      will be fully removing it in the future. We still do work to
      integrate with tflint; Including automatically running tflint
      init and passing through variables. For now using the
      internal version will only emit a warning, and you can opt in
      to the future behavior today in one of two ways:

        The legacy-internal-tflint strict control (recommended)

        Adding the --terragrunt-external-tflint flag to your hook
        usage (this also works in previous versions of Terragrunt);
        this flag is stripped prior to running the external tflint.
        Example:

        terraform {
            before_hook "tflint" {
            commands = ["apply", "plan"]
            execute = ["tflint", "--terragrunt-external-tflint", "--minimum-failure-severity=error", "--config", "custom.tflint.hcl"]
          }
        }

  * New Features
    - Depth control for dependency traversal
      Graph-based expressions in the --filter flag now support
      limiting the depth of graph traversal they perform when
      discovering units. You can now append/prepend a number to the
      end of a graph expression ellipsis to control how deep in
      graph traversal Terragrunt will look for
      dependents/dependencies.

      e.g.

        # Find 'service' and only its direct dependencies (1 level deep)
        terragrunt find --filter 'service...1'

        # Find 'vpc' and only components that directly depend on it (1 level)
        terragrunt find --filter '1...vpc'

        # Find 'db' with 2 levels of dependencies and 1 level of dependents
        terragrunt find --filter '1...db...2'

      This should result in significant performance and usability
      improvements for users with large dependency graphs.
      Special thanks to @sofianedjerbi for contributing this
      feature!
    - Run report schema extended
      The run report has been extended to include the Ref, Cmd and
      Args fields when relevant to a run.
      - The Ref field will be populated for runs performed in Git
        worktrees due to their discovery from a Git-based
        expression in a filter.
      - The Cmd field will contain the sub command of
        OpenTofu/Terraform executed in a run (e.g. plan , apply)
        and the Args field will contain the arguments passed to
        that subcommand (e.g. -auto-approve, -destroy). These can
        differ between runs when using Git-based expressions, as
        additions or modifications of units between Git references
        can result in a plan or apply, whereas removal of units can
        result in plan -destroy or apply -destroy .
  * Experiments Updated
    - IaC Engines Updated to use v0.1.0 of terragrunt-engine-go
      The iac-engine experiment has been updated to use v0.1.0 of
      the terragrunt-engine-go library.
      Given that this is still experimental functionality, no
      effort has been made to maintain backwards compatibility with
      existing engines. If you are currently using the OpenTofu
      engine, you will need to upgrade to v0.1.0 of the engine. The
      Terraform engine will be updated in the near future.
      This update pulls in changes to the protobuf schema used in
      communication between Terragrunt and IaC engines to give
      engines the ability to log messages in Terragrunt and reduces
      the overall size of messages passed to Terragrunt for
      stdout/stderr messages.
  * Process Updates
    - Curl to Bash script available
      In addition to all the other installation mechanisms
      available to install Terragrunt, a convenient curl to bash
      script has been added to minimize the friction in installing
      and getting started with Terragrunt, and removing any
      dependency on third party tools if you don’t want to use
      them.

        curl -sL https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/install | bash

      The installation can be customized, with full customization
      options available via the --help flag.

        curl -sL https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/install | bash -s -- --help

      In addition to providing this script, the ASDF plugin for
      Terragrunt has been updated to automatically perform
      signature verification on an opt-out basis for any version of
      Terragrunt equal or newer to v0.98.0. The Terragrunt entry in
      the Aqua registry has been updated to do the same, meaning
      mise users will automatically benefit from this as well.
      If you don’t want to use the curl to bash script, or any of
      the other distribution methods available, the instructions
      for performing signature verification manually have been
      updated in the installation documentation as well.
  * Documentation Updates
    - OpenTofu/Terraform compatibility matrix now available as API
      In addition to providing a compatibility matrix in the
      Supported Versions documentation, compatibility verification
      is also available via an API endpoint here:
      https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/api/v1/compatibility
      See the compatibility API documentation for more details,
      including availability of query string parameters for
      filtering responses.
    - JSON schema for --auth-provider-cmd published
      A JSON schema has been published for the schema expected for
      the stdout of commands invoked using --auth-provider-cmd. You
      can access the schema here.
      You can use tools like this JSON schema validator or other
      simple utilities to programmatically validate that the stdout
      of JSON responses in your commands invoked by
      --auth-provider-cmd obey the expected schema.
  * Bug Fixes
    - Exit Codes for run --all more consistent
      Fixed an issue where run --all incorrectly returned a 0 exit
      code when individual units failed.
    - Automatic retry for provider queries
      To address intermittent errors in queries to the
      OpenTofu/Terraform provider registries, we expanded the
      automatic retry logic to include timeouts from provider
      registries.

- Update to version 0.98.0:
  * New Features
    - The --filter flag now implies --all
      When using the --filter flag, it is now optional to also
      supply --all. Terragrunt will automatically set the --all
      flag when you use the --filter flag.
  * Bug Fixes
    - Plan files are now correctly passed as CLI arguments for
      destroy operations
      A bug in the logic used for injecting plan files as arguments
      to the apply -destroy command resulted in the plan file
      argument being injected prior to the -auto-approve flag,
      which is disallowed in OpenTofu/Terraform. That bug has been
      fixed.
    - GCS bootstrap authentication fixed
      A bug in the authentication logic for GCS backends prevented
      successful bootstrapping of backends when using the
      --auth-provider-cmd flag. That bug has been fixed.
    - Git-based and Graph-based combinations fixed
      A bug in the discovery logic for Git worktrees prevented
      using a combination of Git-based and Graph-based filter
      expressions in the same filter from working correctly.
      e.g.

        terragrunt find --filter '...^[HEAD^...HEAD]...'

      That bug has been fixed.
    - Proper exit codes returned from -detailed-exitcode
      A bug in the logic for handling retries combined with the
      OpenTofu/Terraform plan -detailed-exitcode and the Terragrunt
      --all flag resulted in the wrong exit code being returned
      when a failed run succeeded on a subsequent retry with a
      status code related to drift (exit code 2).
      That logic has been corrected, and properly follows the rules
      outlined under the --all flag:

      When not using -detailed-exitcode:
      - Terragrunt will return the highest exit code of all runs
        performed.

      When using -detailed-exitcode:
      - If any run has an exit code that is 1, or greater than 2,
        run --all will return the highest exit code.
      - Otherwise, if any run returns an exit code of 2, run --all
        will return an exit code of 2.
      - Otherwise, run --all will return an exit code of 0.

    - OpenTelemetry traces in console mode fixed
      A bug in OpenTelemetry trace exporting prevented traces from
      being exported when in console mode. That bug has been fixed.
    - Negation logic fixed
      A bug in how negation logic was handled in filter expressions
      prevented successful exclusion of stacks from generation and
      over excluded units in runs when users only supplied negative
      filters.
  * Process Improvements
    - Upgrade to Go 1.25.5
      The Golang toolchain used to build Terragrunt has been
      upgraded to v1.25.5.
    - Package reorganization
      All top-level Golang packages in the Terragrunt project have
      been migrated to either internal or pkg. The distinction
      between the two indicates maintainer expectations as to
      whether either are being actively being consumed as libraries
      by third parties (with internal being impossible to import
      without vendoring in go modules).
      Note that this does not indicate any backwards compatibility
      guarantee for usage of the Terragrunt as a library. It will
      remain unstable, and can change at any time.

Mon Jan 12 07:54:28 UTC 2026 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 0.97.2:
  * Performance Improvements
    - Partial parse used for get_working_dir()
      To assess where Terragrunt is going to run OpenTofu, it needs
      partially parsed information from the relevant terragrunt.hcl
      file of the unit running the HCL get_working_dir() function.
      The function was performing a full parse of the
      terragrunt.hcl file, which can be slow for users with large
      HCL configurations.
      Given that the parse only requires access to the value of
      source in the terraform block, a partial parse is now
      performed by the function, only looking at the contents of
      the terraform block, improving performance significantly.
  * Bug Fixes
    - False positive parsing errors suppressed
      When parsing an include that defined dependencies, the HCL
      parser used by Terragrunt would emit spurious errors that are
      internally ignored. Those messages are now suppressed.
    - Signal propagation for interrupts fixed
      A bug in how Terragrunt forwarded signals to processes it
      spawned (like running tofu) resulted in underlying processes
      receiving SIGKILL signals rather than the original signal
      (e.g. SIGINT) sent to the Terragrunt process. That has been
      fixed.
  * Chores
    - Avoiding contextcheck suppression
      While not changing much functionally in Terragrunt, this
      release did involve quite a lot of changes to Terragrunt
      internals. The majority of these changes related to better
      propagation of the Golang
      [context](https://pkg.go.dev/context) object to better obey
      Golang best practices. These issues were reported by the
      contextcheck linter in the codebase, but the findings were
      suppressed due to the scope of work required to address them.
      These changes should make it so that context is propagated
      correctly more reliably in the codebase, increasing the
      usefulness of things like OpenTelemetry tracing and reduced
      resource usage.
      Note that some public function signatures have changed in the
      Terragrunt codebase, which may be a breaking change to users
      consuming Terragrunt as a library. Given that we do not offer
      any stability guarantees for usage of Terragrunt as a
      library, these changes are still to be included in a patch
      release.
  * What's Changed
    - fix: Fixing signal propagation issues (#5326)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 12 07:34:51 UTC 2026 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 0.97.1:
  * New Features
    - All HCL functions instrumented with OpenTelemetry
      All Terragrunt HCL functions now emit OpenTelemetry spans
      when they run, making it easier to understand HCL function
      usage and performance.
    - HCL parsing telemetry improved
      Additional fidelity has been added to traces emitted during
      parsing to give insight as to why configuration parsing is
      being performed, and how.
  * Bug Fixes
    - plan -destroy called correctly for --filter-affected
      A bug in the logic for --filter-affected resulted in removed
      units getting planned/applied instead of being destroyed when
      users supplied --filter-allow-destroy. That bug has been
      fixed.
    - Nested spans in track parents appropriately even when the
      TRACEPARENT environment variable is used.
      A bug in the logic for propagating TRACEPARENT as the
      ultimate parent of traces started in Terragrunt prevented
      child traces from properly tracking parent spans. That bug
      has been fixed.
    - Reports on runs in worktrees now use relative directories to
      worktree root
      Instead of displaying runs of units in Git worktrees during
      Git-based filter expression runs with the absolute path of
      their directories in a temporary directory, they now display
      with the path to the unit relative to the root of the
      worktree.
    - Unnecessary relationship discovery prevented
      Discovery of relationships between units has been made opt-in
      in the discovery process. This will result in no changes to
      usage of commands like run --all, but will significantly
      improve the performance of commands like list and stack
      generate.

Mon Jan 12 06:56:11 UTC 2026 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 0.97.0:
  * Breaking Changes
    - The --queue-strict-include flag is deprecated
      Terragrunt no longer automatically includes dependencies of
      included units. As such the --queue-strict-include flag is no
      longer useful in the Terragrunt CLI.
      The flag has been deprecated, and no longer does anything.
      This flag will not be removed before 2.0.
    - Run report no longer reports --queue-exclude-dir as a reason
      for exclusion
      Run reports no longer report on units excluded from runs as a
      consequence of the --queue-exclude-dir flag.
    - The --units-that-include flag is deprecated
      The --units-that-include flag is now an alias for the
      reading= attribute filter, just like the
      --queue-include-units-reading flag.
      Given that the two flags no longer differ in functionality,
      and that the functionality of the --units-that-include is no
      longer strictly including units that are included, the flag
      has been deprecated.
    - The double-star strict control is complete
      The globbing behavior of Terragrunt in CLI flags has been
      updated to match all paths when ending with a trailing ** .
  * Experiments Completed
    - The filter-flag experiment is completed
      The filter-flag experiment is completed, and the --filter
      flag is now generally available.
      You can use filter expressions as a single unified API for
      controlling the Run Queue, replacing the need to use the
      following CLI flags:

      Legacy —queue flag 	                    Equivalent —filter expression

      —-queue-include-dir=path 	              —-filter='{./path}'
      —-queue-exclude-dir=path 	              —-filter='!{./path}'
      --queue-include-units-reading=root.hcl 	--filter='reading=root.hcl'
      --units-that-include=root.hcl 	        --filter='reading=root.hcl'
      --queue-include-external-dependencies 	--filter='{./**}...'
      --queue-excludes-file=excludes.txt 	    --filters-file='filters.txt' *
      --graph 	                              --filter='...{.}'

      Note that the file used for the --queue-excludes-file does
      not directly translate to the kind of file you can use for a
      --filters-file. To learn more, see the documentation.
      The table above also explains the aliasing that has been done
      internally to replace queue flags with their filter
      equivalents. The aliasing for these queue flags is present
      purely for backwards compatibility purposes, but they are not
      going to emit deprecation warnings, and will not be removed
      before the Terragrunt 1.0 release.
      You are heavily encouraged to adopt the new --filter flag for
      your infrastructure targeting needs as soon as feasible in
      your workflows. It will offer a significantly more flexible
      and powerful experience.
      To learn more see the Filters feature documentation.
      https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/features/filter
  * Bug Fixes
    - The get_original_terragrunt_dir() function is now supported
      in terragrunt.stack.hcl files
      When authoring explicit stacks, using the
      get_original_terragrunt_dir() HCL function in
      terragrunt.stack.hcl files will now return the directory
      where the terragrunt.stack.hcl file lives, even when the
      configuration is read from another stack/unit using
      read_terragrunt_config().
    - Using Git-based expressions with the --out-dir flag is fixed
      When using Git-based expressions using the --filter flag, the
      relative path of units relative to their respective Git
      worktree roots is used for determining where the plan file
      will be saved, rather than a path in the relevant Git
      worktree.
    - Color for output fetching is suppressed more reliably
      Terragrunt will use tofu output -json / terraform output
      -json more reliably when users expect a lack of colors (like
      when colors are suppressed for Terragrunt).

- Update to version 0.96.1:
  * Experiments Updated
    - The --filter-affected flag has more robust determination of
      the default branch in a Git repository
      The --filter-affected flag will now use Git plumbing to
      interrogate the default branch as considered by the remote
      repository before falling back to interrogating local
      configurations for determination of a default branch
      (remember that you must use the filter-flag experiment to try
      this out).

        # This is checked first
        $ git rev-parse --abbrev-ref origin/HEAD

        # Followed by this
        $ git ls-remote --symref origin HEAD

        # Followed with this
        $ git config init.defaultBranch

        # If none of the above succeed, the default branch is assumed to be `main`.

    - Git-based filter expressions now warn users when using local
      state
      Usage of --filter Git-based expressions in combination with
      local state will now emit a warning, recommending usage of
      remote states (remember that you must use the filter-flag
      experiment to try this out).

        $ terragrunt run --all --filter '[HEAD~1...HEAD]' -- plan
        09:30:38.017 WARN   One or more units discovered using Git-based filter expressions (e.g. [HEAD~1...HEAD]) do not have a remote_state configuration. This may result in unexpected outcomes, such as outputs for dependencies returning empty. It is strongly recommended to use remote state when working with Git-based filter expressions.

      See the warning at the bottom of Git-based expressions
      documentation for more information.
      https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/features/filter/#git-based-expressions
    - OpenTelemetry traces added for filter evaluation
      Filter evaluation now emits OpenTelemetry spans and metrics,
      including filter resolution details, evaluation duration, and
      filtering scope. This helps teams analyze performance and
      pinpoint bottlenecks in filtering with large Terragrunt
      repositories.
  * Bug Fixes
    - Path-based filters targeting external paths fixed
      A bug in the parsing of path-based filter expressions in the
      --filter flag of the filter-flag experiment prevented parsing
      of path-based filters for external paths (e.g. --filter
      ../external-dir). This bug has been fixed.
    - HTTPS Git CAS URLs fixed
      A bug in the parsing of source URLs with forced usage of the
      Git protocol (e.g. git::https://github.com/acme/catalog)
      prevented using the cas experiment with HTTPS Git URLs with
      forced usage of the Git protocol. This bug has been fixed.
    - Regression of support for root terragrunt.hcl fixed
      A bug in the processing of --queue-exclude-dir resulted in
      prefix based matching of non-glob expressions in
      --queue-exclude-dir values. This broke backwards
      compatibility for users with a root terragrunt.hcl file
      instead of a differently named file for the root include
      (e.g. root.hcl). This bug has been fixed.
      Note that you are still advised to migrate away from using a
      root terragrunt.hcl as soon as possible for your team. We
      will maintain backwards compatibility until at least 2.0,
      however.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec 16 06:14:21 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 0.96.0:
  * Breaking Changes
    - The --no-destroy-dependencies-check flag has been deprecated
      The default behavior of Terragrunt with respect to checking
      dependents during destroys has been inverted. As a
      consequence the --no-destroy-dependencies-check has been
      deprecated, and a new --destroy-dependencies-check flag has
      been introduced.
      Previously, Terragrunt would automatically parse all
      configurations that might depend on a unit being destroyed to
      warn users that the destroyed configuration might orphan
      other units that depend on it. This was frequently
      undesirable behavior due to the fact that it introduced
      additional unnecessary work (parsing all HCL configurations
      unnecessarily), and could introduce errors if users had
      unrelated invalid HCL configurations.
      Terragrunt now requires that users opt-in to this behavior
      via the new --destroy-dependencies-check flag, which enables
      the destroy check, and will not perform the destroy check by
      default.

        terragrunt run --destroy-dependencies-check -- destroy

      To learn more, see the no-destroy-dependencies-check strict
      control.
      https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/strict-controls/#no-destroy-dependencies-check
    - The --disable-command-validation flag has been deprecated
      Terragrunt no longer performs command name validation when
      passing commands to OpenTofu/Terraform from Terragrunt when
      using the run command. This makes the
      --disable-command-validation flag unnecessary, as the lack of
      validation is now the default behavior.
      Previously, Terragrunt had no way to explicitly indicate that
      a command being used on the Terragrunt CLI was intended as a
      passthrough to the OpenTofu/Terraform CLI, so it was
      important that validation be done on the command being
      supplied on the Terragrunt CLI.
      Since completion of the CLI Redesign, this has changed
      significantly. Users now have explicit shortcuts on the
      Terragrunt CLI for common OpenTofu/Terraform commands and an
      explicit interface for passing through OpenTofu/Terraform
      commands to the OpenTofu/Terraform CLIs using the run
      command. By removing this validation, Terragrunt will now
      automatically support new OpenTofu/Terraform commands in
      future versions of the tools and allow for greater
      flexibility in IaC Engines, as novel commands can be
      introduced.
      To learn more, see the disable-command-validation strict
      control.
      https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/strict-controls/#disable-command-validation
    - The --experimental-engine flag now enables the iac-engine experiment
      The experimental IaC Engine feature was introduced in
      Terragrunt prior to the introduction of the experiment
      system. As such, it wasn’t enabled when users enabled
      experiment mode, and didn’t have a dedicated section in the
      experiments docs.
      The --experimental-engine flag is now an alias for explicitly
      enabling the iac-engine experiment, and using IaC Engines
      will be allowed when using Terragrunt in experiment mode.
      This increases consistency with how experimental features are
      managed in Terragrunt, and reduces the surface area users
      have to be aware of in the Terragrunt CLI.

        terragrunt run --experiment=iac-engine

      Note that you can explicitly disable usage of engines now
      with the --no-engine flag, even when the experiment is
      active.

        terragrunt run --experiment=iac-engine --no-engine

      To learn more, see the iac-engine experiment.
      https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/experiments/#iac-engine
    - The --dependency-fetch-output-from-state flag now enables the
      dependency-fetch-output-from-state experiment
      The experimental —dependency-fetch-output-from-state flag was
      introduced in Terragrunt prior to the introduction of the
      experiment system. As such, it wasn’t enabled when users
      enabled experiment mode, and didn’t have a dedicated section
      in the experiments docs.
      The --dependency-fetch-output-from-state flag is now an alias
      for explicitly enabling the
      dependency-fetch-output-from-state experiment, and Terragrunt
      will automatically attempt to fetch outputs from backend
      state when in experiment mode. This increases consistency
      with how experimental features are managed in Terragrunt, and
      reduces the surface area users have to be aware of in the
      Terragrunt CLI.

        terragrunt run --experiment=dependency-fetch-output-from-state

      Note that you can explicitly disable fetching output from
      state with the --no-dependency-fetch-output-from-state flag,
      even when the experiment is active.

        terragrunt run --experiment=dependency-fetch-output-from-state --no-dependency-fetch-output-from-state

      To learn more, see the dependency-fetch-output-from-state
      experiment.
      https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/experiments/#dependency-fetch-output-from-state
  * Experiments Updated
    - The filter-flag experiment now supports the --filters-file
      flag
      The --filters-file flag has been introduced to allow for the
      application of multiple filters as defined in a
      newline-delimited text file, similar to the existing
      --excludes-file flag (remember that you must use the
      filter-flag experiment to try this).

        # custom-filters.txt
        !./unstable/**

        $ terragrunt find --filters-file custom-filters.txt
        # No results in `./unstable` discovered.

      When the filter-flag experiment is active, Terragrunt will
      automatically parse and apply filters found in a
      .terragrunt-filters file, similar to how it automatically
      parses and applies excludes found in a .terragrunt-excludes
      file.

        # .terragrunt-filters
        !./unstable/**

        # Note that it only does this by default when the experiment is active.
        terragrunt find
        # Still no results in `./unstable` discovered.

      To explicitly disable usage of filter files (including the
      automatic .terragrunt-filters file), use the
      --no-filters-file flag.

         # .terragrunt-filters
         !./unstable/**

        # Note that it only does this by default when the experiment is active.
        terragrunt find --no-filters-file
        # This _will_ allow results in `./unstable` to be discovered.

      Unlike the --excludes-file, usage of the --filters-file flag
      also allows for always filtering for particular
      configurations.

        # .terragrunt-filters
        ./always-include/**

      To learn more, see the filters file documentation.
      https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/cli/commands/run/#the-filters-file
  * Bug Fixes
    - Unnecessary .terragrunt-cache directory no longer generated
      in run --all runs
      Fixed a regression where run --all would create empty
      .terragrunt-cache directories in the current working

Sun Dec 14 09:05:40 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 0.95.1:
  * Experiments Updated
    - The filter-flag experiment now supports the --filter-affected
      flag
      The --filter-affected flag has been introduced as an
      convenience alias for --filter [main...HEAD] (remember that
      you must use the filter-flag experiment to try this).

        terragrunt find --filter-affected

      Note that if you have local Git configurations that results
      in a different branch being your default branch, that branch
      will be used instead of main.
  * Bug Fixes
    - Integration of --queue-strict-include with
      --queue-include-units-reading fixed
      A regression in --queue-strict-include resulted in empty run
      queues when using a combination of --queue-strict-include
      with --queue-include-units-reading. That bug has been
      resolved.
    - Integration of --source with run --all fixed
      A regression in --source prevented it from working correctly
      in combination with run --all , resulting in empty run
      queues. That bug has been resolved.
    - Integration of Git-expressions with explicit stacks
      A bug in the implementation of explicit stack generation for
      Git-expressions prevented stacks from being generated in Git
      worktrees when using Git-expressions in the filter-flag
      experiment. That bug has been resolved.

Fri Dec 12 16:04:42 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 0.95.0:
  * Breaking Changes
    - The --queue-exclude-external flag has been deprecated
      Previously, Terragrunt would automatically pull in external
      dependencies (dependencies outside the current working
      directory when running terragrunt run --all) into the run
      queue.
      To prevent this behavior, users had to manually supply the
      --queue-exclude-external flag. This has caused significant
      confusion and unexpected behavior for users over the duration
      of it’s existence in the Terragrunt CLI. To prevent this
      unexpected behavior for users and follow the principle of
      least surprise, this flag has been deprecated and its
      behavior is now the default in Terragrunt.
      To explicitly request inclusion of external dependencies in
      the run queue, use the —queue-include-external flag.
      https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/cli/commands/run/#queue-include-external
  * Process Updates
    - OpenTofu 1.11.x added to compatibility matrix
      We are now continuously testing against OpenTofu 1.11.1 in
      our Continuous Integration testing, and have updated the
      compatibility matrix to reflect that.
      https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/supported-versions/
  * Updated Experiments
    - The filter-flag experiment now supports Git-based expressions
      The --filter flag can now be used to filter units based on
      changes in Git history (remember that you must use the
      filter-flag experiment to try this).

        # Compare between two references
        terragrunt find --filter '[main...HEAD]'

        # Shorthand: compare reference to HEAD
        terragrunt find --filter '[main]'

        # Compare between specific commits
        terragrunt find --filter '[abc123...def456]'

        # Compare between tags
        terragrunt find --filter '[v1.0.0...v2.0.0]'

        # Compare using relative references
        terragrunt find --filter '[HEAD~1...HEAD]'

        # Compare between branches
        terragrunt find --filter '[feature-branch...main]'

      For more information, see the dedicated documentation on
      Git-Based Filtering.
      https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/features/filter/#git-based-filtering
  * Bug Fixes
    - Units now properly flush stdout in run --all
      A regression in unit stdout flushing caused stdout for unit
      logs to hang pending resolution of run --all runs. This
      regression has been fixed to ensure that logs are streamed in
      real time again.
    - Queue entries now properly run, even if dependent units are
      excluded
      A bug in run queue optimization made it so that excluding the
      dependent of a unit within a multi-unit run queue would
      incorrectly exclude the dependency unit from the run queue.
      This bug has been resolved, and units are now properly
      included, even if their dependents are excluded.
    - Provider cache server only contacts relevant registries
      The provider cache server was incorrectly establishing a
      connection with multiple registries even though only one
      registry for a given IaC tool run by Terragrunt. For users
      with network-restricted environments, this could cause
      problems. Terragrunt will now only contact the relevant
      registry for a given IaC tool unless users explicitly request
      for usage of multiple registries.
  * Documentation Updates
    - Provider cache server no longer documented as experimental
      The Provider Cache Server has been used in production by a
      good portion of the Terragrunt community based on voluntary
      community reporting. The need for the feature is also
      mitigated by advances in OpenTofu that makes the Automatic
      Provider Cache Dir the default solution all Terragrunt users
      using OpenTofu ≥ v1.10.0.
      As such, the Provider Cache Server has been promoted to a
      generally available feature that is exclusively opt-in for
      users that cannot benefit from the Automatic Provider Cache
      Dir feature, or are better served by the Provider Cache
      Server due to scale or platform limitations.

- Update to version 0.93.6:
  * Process Improvements
    - Terragrunt release automation moved to GitHub Actions
      The release automation for Terragrunt has moved to GitHub
      Actions. With this move, Terragrunt releases now support:
      - Windows binary signing
      - Additional packaging for artifacts (.zip and .tar.gz
        release artifacts)
      You can still download standalone executables from release
      assets for backward compatibility.
  * Experiments Updated
    - The filter-flag experiment now supports the source= attribute
      The --filter flag can now be used to filter units by their
      usage of particular OpenTofu/Terraform modules in their
      terraform source blocks (remember that you must use the
      filter-flag experiment to try this).

        # Filter by exact source match
        terragrunt find --filter 'source=github.com/acme/foo'
        terragrunt find --filter 'source=gitlab.com/example/baz'
        terragrunt find --filter 'source=./module'

        # Filter by source using glob patterns
        terragrunt find --filter 'source=*github.com**acme/*'
        terragrunt find --filter 'source=git::git@github.com:acme/**'
        terragrunt find --filter 'source=**github.com**'
        terragrunt find --filter 'source=gitlab.com/**'

- Update to version 0.93.5:
  * Experiments Updated
    - The filter-flag experiment now supports --filter in stack
      generate
      The --filter flag can now be used in the stack generate
      command, and any command that performs stack generation, e.g.
      run --all (remember that you must use the filter-flag
      experiment to try this).
      The --filter flag works in a slightly unique way when used to
      control stack generation in that it needs to be explicitly
      restricted to stacks for it to impact stack generation using
      the type=stack attribute filter.
      e.g.

        # Supported: Only generate the stacks that match the
        # filter, as we are explicitly indicating that we are
        # targeting stacks.
        terragrunt stack generate --filter 'name=prod | type=stack'

        # Not supported: This filter will be ignored, as we are not
        # explicitly indicating that we are targeting stacks.
        terragrunt stack generate --filter 'name=prod'  # This will not work

      The reason for this is that stack generation can also be done
      automatically as part of other commands, like run, and thus
      we need to make it clear that we’re trying to control stack
      generation rather than run behavior.

        # This will run any unit named 'vpc'
        terragrunt run --all --filter 'vpc' -- plan

        # This will run any unit named 'vpc', and prevent stack
        # generation in any stack not named 'dev' (including any
        # stacks named 'vpc')
        terragrunt stack run --filter 'vpc' --filter 'name=dev | type=stack' -- apply

      For more information, see the filter feature documentation

Mon Nov 10 16:31:06 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 0.93.4:
  * Updated Experiments
    - The filter-flag experiment now supports graph expressions
      The --filter flag now supports usage of graph expressions,
      allowing users to filter based on the dependency relationship
      of units discovered by Terragrunt (remember that you must use
      the filter-flag experiment to try this).

      e.g.

        # Find 'service' and everything it depends on
        terragrunt find --filter 'service...'

        # Find 'vpc' and everything that depends on it
        terragrunt find --filter '...vpc'

        # Find 'db' and its complete dependency graph
        terragrunt find --filter '...db...'

        # Find all dependents of 'vpc' but exclude 'vpc' itself
        terragrunt find --filter '...^vpc'

      You can learn more about graph-based filtering in the filter
      feature documentation.

Thu Nov 06 06:20:41 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 0.93.3:
  * Bug Fixes
    - hcl validate --inputs regression on validation blocks
      resolved
      A bug introduced in v0.93.1 preventing hcl validate --inputs
      from succeeding on OpenTofu/Terraform modules with variables
      containing validation blocks. This was caused by an error in
      the update to OpenTofu/Terraform .tf file parsing by
      Terragrunt in the hcl validate command.
      That bug has been resolved.
  * What's Changed
    - Allow validation blocks in inputs (#5063)
    - build(deps): bump tar from 7.5.1 to 7.5.2 in /docs-starlight
      (#5057)
    - chore: Updating pin to `v0.93.2` for remote references
      (#5058)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov 05 16:18:13 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 0.93.2:
  * New Features
    - The list command now supports the dot fomat
      The list command can now render its output in the Graphviz
      DOT language:

        $ terragrunt list --format=dot --dependencies
        digraph {
          "live/dev/vpc" ;
          "live/dev/db" ;
          "live/dev/ec2" ;
          "live/dev/db" -> "live/dev/vpc";
          "live/dev/ec2" -> "live/dev/db";
          "live/dev/ec2" -> "live/dev/vpc";
          "live/prod/vpc" ;
          "live/prod/db" ;
          "live/prod/ec2" ;
          "live/prod/db" -> "live/prod/vpc";
          "live/prod/ec2" -> "live/prod/db";
          "live/prod/ec2" -> "live/prod/vpc";
        }

      This was previously only possible using the dag graph
      command, but that command has been refactored to be an alias
      for the list --format=dot --dependencies command, to provide
      greater flexibility in how graphs are rendered in the DOT
      language. This includes integration with the experimental
      Filter feature.
      You can learn more about this in the list command
      documentation
      https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/cli/commands/list/#dot-format
  * What's Changed
    - docs: Documenting `dot` format for the `list` command (#5042)
    - chore: Refactor `find` & `list` so that they use a single
      write instead of intermediate writes (#5027)
    - feat: Moving `dag graph` to `list` (#5013)
    - fix: Pinning commit until we can fix more permanently
    - chore: Disable experimental tests ignore in CI
    - chore: CICD updates (#5056)

Tue Nov 04 20:20:56 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 0.93.1:
  * Performance Improvements
    - Reduced redundant --auth-provider-cmd invocations during
      run-all
    - This cuts down on external credential calls and lowers
      authentication overhead for large runs.
    - Updated the unit resolver to reuse the configuration parsed
      during discovery instead of re-parsing each terragrunt.hcl.
    - This reduces HCL parses and allocations, shortening execution
      time on complex stacks.
    In our internal “Run all with Auth Provider” benchmark (10
    runs, ~10 ms on auth command), these changes reduced average
    runtime from ~235 ms to ~213 ms (about 9% faster) compared to
    v0.93.0.
    https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/tag/v0.93.1
  * What's Changed
    - feat: unit resolver performance improvements (#5040)
    - Add beta releases (#5052)
    - allow input validation with variable in source or version
      (#5041)
    - perf: More useful benchmark for determining impact of `hcl
      fmt` optimization (#5026)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Nov 02 07:18:46 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 0.93.0:
  * Breaking Changes
    - Removal of deprecated HCL attributes
      The skip, retryable_errors, retry_max_attempts and
      retry_sleep_interval_sec have all been removed from
      Terragrunt.
      This is the final planned breaking change on the road to
      Terragrunt 1.0 related to removal of deprecated
      functionality. Breaking changes will be minimized before
      Terragrunt 1.0, but may still occur based on user feedback,
      or based on the need to stabilize parts of Terragrunt before
      1.0.
      If you are currently using the skip attribute, you'll want to
      adjust your usage to leverage the exclude block instead:

      Before:

        # terragrunt.hcl

        skip = true

      After:

        # terragrunt.hcl

        exclude {
          if      = true
          actions = ["all"]
        }

      If you are currently using the retryable_errors attribute,
      you'll want to adjust your usage to leverage the errors block
      instead:

      Before:

        # terragrunt.hcl

        retryable_errors = [
          ".*Error: transient network issue.*",
          ".*Error: timeout.*"
        ]

        retry_max_attempts     = 3
        retry_sleep_interval_sec = 5

      After:

        # terragrunt.hcl

        errors {
          retry "transient_errors" {
            retryable_errors = [
              ".*Error: transient network issue.*",
              ".*Error: timeout.*"
            ]
            max_attempts = 3
            sleep_interval_sec = 5
          }
        }

- Update to version 0.92.1:
  * New Features
    - hcl fmt supports --parallelism for controlling concurrency
      The hcl fmt command now supports the --parallelism flag for
      controlling the number of concurrent files getting formatted.
      By default, the number of concurrent file formats will be
      determined by the number of CPU cores detected on the system
      running Terragrunt.
      See hcl fmt documentation for more information.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct 28 05:46:20 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 0.92.0:
  For more details and code exmaples, please see the release notes:
  https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/tag/v0.92.0
  * Breaking Changes
    - Internal boilerplate dependency upgraded to v0.10.1
      The templating engine (Boilerplate) used by the Terragrunt
      catalog and scaffold commands has been upgraded to v0.10.1.
      As a consequence, the default behavior of scaffolding when
      using the catalog and scaffold commands has changed to allow
      for the use of Boilerplate hooks and shell commands (see
      hooks and helpers in Boilerplate documentation) by default.
      Note that Boilerplate will ask for permission interactively
      by default to run said hooks and shell commands, and that the
      interactive prompt will propagate to Terragrunt users.
  * Experiments Updated
    - filter-flag experiment now supported in hcl commands
      The --filter flag is now supported in hcl commands (validate
      and fmt) (remember that you must use the filter-flag
      experiment to try this).
      When using the --filter flag for hcl fmt, filtering applies
      to files instead of units / stacks. Only file path filters
      are supported for the hcl fmt command.
  * Performance Improvements
    - hcl fmt Performance Improved
      The performance of the hcl fmt command has been improved
      substantially.
      Formatting files is now roughly twice as fast due to
      parallelization of file formatting, and optimizations used in
      file exclusion.
  * What's Changed
    - docs: Documenting support for `--filter` in `hcl` commands
      (#5010)
    - chore: Bumping boilerplate (#4805)
    - feat: Adding support for `--filter` in `hcl` commands (#5006)

Mon Oct 27 05:51:44 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 0.91.5:
  * Experiments Updated
    - filter-flag updated with run support
      The --filter flag is now supported on the run command
      (remember that you must use the filter-flag experiment to try
      this).
      e.g.

        # Filter by path with glob patterns
        terragrunt run --all --filter 'prod/**' -- plan

        # Filter by name
        terragrunt run --all --filter 'app*' -- apply

        # Exclude specific configurations
        terragrunt run --all --filter '!./test/**' -- plan

        # Combine filters with intersection (refinement)
        terragrunt run --all --filter './prod/** | !name=legacy' -- apply

        # Multiple filters with union
        terragrunt run --all --filter 'app1' --filter 'app2' -- plan

      For more information, see the documentation on Filtering
      Units.

Fri Oct 24 05:38:03 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 0.91.4:
  * Experiments Updated
    - filter-flag updated with reading= support
      The --filter flag now supports usage of the reading=
      attribute to filter on components that read particular shared
      infrastructure configurations.
      e.g.

        terragrunt find --filter 'reading=shared.hcl'
        terragrunt find --filter 'reading=common/*.hcl' # Globs supported!
        terragrunt find --filter 'reading=config/**' # Double-wildcard globs are required filtering on files nested in subdirectories.
        terragrunt find --filter 'reading=config/vars.tfvars'

      This behavior is similar to that provided by the
      --queue-include-units-reading flag, with additional support
      for globs, negation and filter chaining supported in the
      --filter flag more generally.
      For more information, see the documentation on
      Attribute-Based Filtering.
      https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/cli/commands/find/#attribute-based-filtering

Fri Oct 24 05:09:11 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 0.91.3:
  * New Features
    - --reading flag added to the find command
      The find command now supports the --reading flag, which
      allows you to discover the shared configurations read by
      units and stacks when using the --json format.

        $ terragrunt find --reading --json
        [
          {
            "type": "unit",
            "path": "aws-account-1",
            "reading": [
              "aws-data.yml"
            ]
          },
          {
            "type": "unit",
            "path": "aws-account-2",
            "reading": [
              "aws-data.yml"
            ]
          },
          {
            "type": "unit",
            "path": "gcp-project-1",
            "reading": [
              "gcp-data.hcl"
            ]
          }
        ]

      You can use this information to drive custom logic in your
      workflows based on the changes related to particular files.
      e.g.

        $ terragrunt find --reading --json | jq '[.[] | select(.reading[]? | contains("aws-data.yml"))| .path]'
        [
          "aws-account-1",
          "aws-account-2"
        ]

        $ terragrunt find --reading --json | jq '[.[] | select(.reading[]? | contains("gcp-data.hcl"))| .path]'
        [
          "gcp-project-1"
        ]

      You can learn more about the --reading flag in the find
      documentation.
      https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/cli/commands/find/#reading-files
  * Bug Fixes
    - Empty stacks no longer throw errors
      Previously, a bug in the logic used for making sure that
      users didn’t accidentally run on empty stacks resulted in
      users getting a non-zero exit code when all units in a stack
      were excluded (e.g. via the exclude block).
      That bug has been fixed.
    - Dependency outputs can now be used in generate blocks
      Previously, a bug in the way HCL parsing was done during
      discovery resulted in errors being thrown for users when

- Update to version 0.91.2:
  * Experiments Introduced
    - filter-flag introduced
      A new experiment named filter-flag has been introduced,
      allowing for experimental usage of the new --filter flag
      described in RFC #4060. The filter-flag experiment is
      incomplete, and minimal support for the --filter flag has
      been added exclusively to the find and list commands.
      The filter flag allows for sophisticated querying of
      particular Terragrunt stacks and units in a way that is
      currently only possible using a combination of —queue-
      prefixed flags.
      Example filter usage might look like the following:

        $ terragrunt find --filter './prod/** | name=web'
        prod/services/web

      Important
      While the filter-flag experiment is active, you will need to
      enable the filter-flag experiment for any command that uses
      the filter-flag. See Controlling Experiment Mode for more
      details.

        e.g.

        terragrunt find --experiment filter-flag --filter './prod/** | name=web'

      You can learn more about filters, including documentation on
      the syntax and examples of each type of filter in the
      dedicated feature documentation for filters.

- Update to version 0.91.0:
  * Breaking Changes
    - Removal of behavior where inputs are read from dependencies
      Terragrunt no longer exposes dependency inputs as accessible
      values.
      This change improves performance and simplifies dependency
      handling by removing a feature that significantly slowed
      configuration parsing due to a requirement for recursive
      parsing of dependencies of dependencies for every dependent.
      If your configurations currently access dependency inputs
      like this:

      dependency "foo" {
        config_path = "../foo"
      }

      inputs = {
        my_input = dependency.foo.inputs.an_input_from_foo
      }

      You’ll need to update them to reference outputs instead:

      dependency "foo" {
        config_path = "../foo"
      }

      inputs = {
        my_input = dependency.foo.outputs.an_output_from_foo
      }

      Accessing outputs remains the supported and recommended way
      to share data between modules.

- Update to version 0.90.2:
  * New Features
    - Added --terragrunt-no-cache flag for run_cmd
      The run_cmd command now supports a new flag,
      --terragrunt-no-cache, which disables caching of command
      execution output.
      This option is useful when you want to ensure that each
      command run produces fresh results, especially in dynamic
      environments or when working with frequently changing
      external data.
  * What's Changed
    - feat: add `--terragrunt-no-cache` parameter for `run_cmd`
      (#4951)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct 17 06:12:25 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 0.90.1:
  * New Features
    - hcl fmt now supports --queue flags
      The hcl fmt command now supports --queue- prefixed flags
      (e.g. --queue-exclude-dir).
  * Bug Fixes
    - Discovery in run command discovers hidden directories
      When discovering units for the run command, Terragrunt will
      now search through (most) hidden directories.
      It will still avoid performing discovery in the following
      hidden directories:

          .git
          .terraform
          .terragrunt-cache

      To manually force or suppress discovery, use
      --queue-include-dir and --queue-exclude-dir respectively.
    - --queue-ignore-errors no longer breaks DAG resolution
      A bug in the implementation of --queue-ignore-errors resulted
      in the flag also preventing the proper resolution of the
      Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) when suppressing errors.
      This has been fixed.
    - --tf-path respected through dependencies
      A bug in the precedence resolution of the terraform_binary
      HCL attribute and the --tf-path flag resulted in the default
      value of terraform_binary taking affect (tofu if both tofu
      and terraform are installed) when terraform_binary was not
      specified in dependencies.
      This bug has been resolved, and the --tf-path flag will be
      respected in dependencies as well.
    - Spurious errors resolved in read_terragrunt_config()
      A bug caused the read_terragrunt_config() HCL function to
      return spurious errors when used in a configuration parsed
      during the discovery phase of configuration resolution of a
      run.
      This has been fixed.

  * Removal of deprecated commands
    This is the next step on the road to Terragrunt 1.0, completing
    the Terragrunt CLI Redesign. Read the CLI Redesign migration
    guide for guidance on adapting to these breaking changes.
    We anticipate no further breaking changes to the CLI prior to
    the release of Terragrunt 1.0, where the CLI will remain stable
    without breaking changes until at least Terragrunt 2.0.
    For a full list of deprecated features that will be removed
    prior to the release of Terragrunt 1.0, see the removal
    schedule.
  * Breaking Changes
    - Removal of Deprecated Commands
      The following deprecated CLI commands have been removed to
      streamline the command line API ahead of 1.0.
      Use the new commands introduced during the CLI redesign that
      replace them:
      - terragrunt terragrunt-info → terragrunt info print
      - terragrunt hclfmt → terragrunt hcl fmt
      - terragrunt hclvalidate → terragrunt hcl validate
      - terragrunt validate-inputs → terragrunt hcl validate --inputs
      - terragrunt render-json → terragrunt render --json -w

- Update to version 0.89.0:
  * Breaking Changes
    - Runner-pool
      Terragrunt now supports the Runner Pool concurrency model,
      replacing the traditional group-based concurrency model with
      a dynamic scheduler by default.
      Instead of waiting for groups of units that block downstream
      units to complete their runs, the Runner Pool executes each
      unit as soon as its dependencies (or dependents for destroys)
      are resolved. This improves efficiency, reduces bottlenecks,
      and limits the impact of individual failures on the run of
      the entire queue.
      New Features
      - Dynamically schedules Units as soon as dependencies (or
        dependents) are satisfied
      - Improves throughput for large stacks
      - Provides better fault-isolation for failed units
    - Report
      The experimental Report feature is now stable and enabled by
      default.
      Every Terragrunt run will now emit a short summary at the end
      of the run that looks like the following by default:

        $ terragrunt run --all plan

        # Omitted for brevity...

        ❯❯ Run Summary  3 units  62ms
           ────────────────────────────
           Succeeded    3

      This summary will give a high-level overview of the run
      results for units in a given Terragrunt run.
      You can optionally request a CSV or JSON report of runs as
      well, giving you detailed insights as to the performance of
      each run using the --report flag:

        $ terragrunt run --all plan --report-schema-file report.schema.csv
        Name,Started,Ended,Result,Reason,Cause
        first-exclude,2025-06-05T16:28:41-04:00,2025-06-05T16:28:41-04:00,excluded,exclude block,

            "Result": "succeeded"
          }
        ]

      New Features
      - Generates detailed run reports (CSV and JSON formats
        supported)
      - Displays run summaries directly in the CLI output
      - Allows disabling summaries if desired
      To learn more about the Run Report feature, read the
      dedicated guide on Run Reports here.
      https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/features/run-report/
      Migration Guide
      No action is required
      To disable summary output explicitly, use
      --disable-report-summary:

        terragrunt run --all plan --disable-report-summary

    - Auto OpenTofu Provider Cache Directory
      Terragrunt now automatically configures OpenTofu’s native
      provider caching mechanism by default when running with
      OpenTofu > = 1.10.
      Note that if you are using Terraform, you will not be able to
      take advantage of this new feature.
      This feature is only possible in OpenTofu due to the hard
      work and coordination with the OpenTofu team to ensure that
      concurrent access to the provider cache directory is safe for
      all OpenTofu users, regardless of whether they use
      Terragrunt.
      New Features
      - Automatically sets the TF_PLUGIN_CACHE_DIR environment
        variable
      - Uses OpenTofu’s native provider cache instead of
        Terragrunt’s internal cache server
      - Provides improved concurrency safety in multi-runner and CI
        environments
      Migration Guide
      No action is required if you’re running OpenTofu > = 1.10 —
      provider caching will be configured automatically.
      To disable this behavior, use the
      --no-auto-provider-cache-dir flag:

        terragrunt run --all apply --no-auto-provider-cache-dir

  * Breaking Changes
    - Default Command Forwarding Removed
      Terragrunt no longer forwards unknown top‑level commands to
      OpenTofu by default.
      Invoking an unknown command now fails with guidance to use
      the explicit run form.
      This is the next step in the removal of deprecated features
      in Terragrunt on the road to Terragrunt 1.0, with more to
      follow. Read the CLI Redesign migration guide for guidance on
      adapting to future breaking changes.
      https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/migrate/cli-redesign/
      For a full list of deprecated features that will be removed
      prior to the release of Terragrunt 1.0, see the removal
      schedule.
      https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/3535
      - Old Behavior (Deprecated)
        terragrunt workspace ls
        terragrunt graph
      - New Behavior
        terragrunt run -- workspace ls
        terragrunt run -- graph
      - Migration Guide
        Keep using shortcuts for common commands:
          terragrunt plan
          terragrunt apply
        Replace usage of any OpenTofu/Terraform command that isn’t
        a supported shortcut with explicit usage of the run
        command:
          terragrunt workspace ls => terragrunt run -- workspace ls
          terragrunt graph => terragrunt run -- graph
        When mixing Terragrunt and OpenTofu flags, separate them
        with --:
          terragrunt run -- apply -auto-approve
          terragrunt run -- output -json
          terragrunt run --all -- plan -var foo=bar
    - Command-specific flags must be used after their commands
      As part of the changes to remove the deprecated behavior of
      forwarding unknown commands to OpenTofu by default, users
      can no longer treat flags as global flags unless they are
      in-fact global flags.
      For example, the following will still work:
        terragrunt --log-level debug plan
        terragrunt --no-color plan
      But the following will no longer be supported:
        terragrunt --provider-cache run --all plan
      Instead, you must supply flags after the commands they are
      used by:
        terragrunt run --all --provider-cache plan
    - Flag Scope Changes (backend + feature flags)
      Backend migration and feature-related flags are now
      command-scoped and should appear after the relevant
      subcommand.
      These flags are accepted on run, backend, scaffold, find, and
      list
      Affected flags:
        backend-bootstrap
        backend-require-bootstrap
        disable-bucket-update
        feature key=value
      - Old Behavior (Deprecated)
        Command-specific flags could be set anywhere in the
        arguments for a command:
          terragrunt --backend-bootstrap backend delete --all
          terragrunt --feature stage=true plan
      - New Behavior
        Place flags after the respective command they control:
          terragrunt backend bootstrap --backend-bootstrap
          terragrunt plan --feature stage=true
          terragrunt find --feature stage=true
      - Migration Guide
        Move these flags to follow the subcommand they apply to
          terragrunt --feature stage=true plan => terragrunt plan --feature stage=true

  * Bug Fixes
    - Fixed S3 update prompt message
      A typo in the prompt for backend bootstrap adjustment
      resulted in the word "res" being used instead of "out".
        Remote state S3 bucket is res of date. Would you like
        Terragrunt to update it? (y/n)
      The typo has been corrected like so:
        Remote state S3 bucket is out of date. Would you like
        Terragrunt to update it? (y/n)
    - Added synchronization controls for queue and discovery
      The queue and discovery packages used in find and list
      commands and the runner-pool experiment were updated to

Sun Sep 21 13:14:51 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 0.87.0:
  * Breaking Changes
    - Automatic Backend Provisioning Removed
      Terragrunt no longer automatically provisions backend
      resources.
      If backend provisioning is required but not explicitly
      enabled, Terragrunt will now exit with an error.
  * Old Behavior (Deprecated)
    - The following command would silently provision backend
      resources before execution:

      terragrunt plan --non-interactive

  * New Behavior
    - This behavior has been removed. Running the same command
      without opting in will now produce an error if backend
      bootstrapping is required.
      To continue to automatically bootstrap backends, you must
      explicitly enable backend provisioning with either the
      --backend-bootstrap flag or the TG_BACKEND_BOOTSTRAP
      environment variable:

        terragrunt plan --backend-bootstrap --non-interactive
      or
        export TG_BACKEND_BOOTSTRAP=true
        terragrunt plan --non-interactive

  * Migration Guide
    - If you relied on automatic backend bootstrapping:
      - Add --backend-bootstrap to your Terragrunt commands, or set
        the TG_BACKEND_BOOTSTRAP environment variable.
    - If you don’t require backend provisioning:
      - No action needed — simply run Terragrunt commands without
        the flag.
  * Road to 1.0 Deprecated Feature Removal Schedule #3535
    https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/3535
  * What's Changed
    - chore: Disabled automatic backend provisioning by @denis256

Thu Sep 18 06:02:17 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 0.86.3:
  * Bug Fixes
    - Stacks now generate in topological order
      A race condition caused by concurrent generation of nested
      Terragrunt Stacks when a .terragrunt-stack directory already
      exists has been remediated.
      Stacks will now generate topologically regardless of whether
      they are cleanly generated or generated when a
      terragrunt-stack directory already exists, resulting in
      parent stacks generating before child stacks.
    - get_aws_account_id() interaction with --auth-provider-cmd
      fixed
      A bug introduced in the upgrade to AWS SDK v2 in v0.85.1
      where get_aws_account_id() would not work properly when used
      in conjunction with the --auth-provider-cmd flag has been
      remediated.
    - Custom API endpoints for backend resources are now set
      correctly
      A bug introduced in the upgrade to AWS SDK v2 in v0.85.1
      where integration with the S3 and DynamoDB AWS SDK clients
      did not properly respect the endpoint setting for backend
      configurations has been remediated.
    - ref properly handled in catalog urls
      The use of the ref query string parameter in Catalog
      go-getter URLs has been fixed, allowing users to explicitly
      specify the ref they want to use for their catalog sources.
    - dag graph updated to support all run flags
      The dag graph command has been updated to support all flags
      supported by the run command.
  * Docs
    - Terragrunt Scale page published
      The Terragrunt Scale page has been published, showcasing a
      new offering from Gruntwork to help customers scale up their
      IaC usage. It showcases the integration Terragrunt has with
      commercial offerings from Gruntwork to help organizations
      scale their infrastructure management.
    - The Terralith to Terragrunt has been published
      A step-by-step guide to transitioning IaC configurations from
      a Terralith (where all resources are in a single state file)
      to a modern Terragrunt IaC configuration, using Terragrunt
      Stacks has been published named Terralith to Terragrunt.
      This is the first major guide in this style, with more to
      come in the future to address specific pain points for
      members of the community in a step-by-step guide, rather than
      a reference or high level summary of features.

Tue Aug 19 07:12:54 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 0.85.0:
  * Breaking Changes
    - Removal of legacy Terragrunt flags
      All deprecated flags that start with --terragrunt- have been
      removed in favor of their modern counterparts.
      This is the next step in the removal of deprecated features
      in
      Terragrunt on the road to Terragrunt 1.0, with more to
      follow. Read the CLI Redesign migration guide for future
      breaking changes.
    - Update of stack run directory context
      The stack run command no longer assumes that users will have
      a .terragrunt-stack directory present in the same directory
      as the terragrunt.stack.hcl file. This caused issues for
      users that were leveraging the no_dot_terragrunt_stack
      attribute, as the run might have skipped over units generated
      outside the .terragrunt-stack directory and thrown an error
      if all units were generated without the .terragrunt-stack
      directory.
      (see example in the release notes)
      https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/tag/v0.85.0
  * Features
    - The runner-pool experiment has been integrated with
      OpenTelemetry
      The runner-pool experiment has been updated to integrate
      properly with OpenTelemetry.
  * Bug Fixes
    - stack output now respects no_dot_terragrunt_stack
      Previously, when running the stack output command, Terragrunt
      would incorrectly assume that all units were generated within
      a .terragrunt-stack directory. This bug has been fixed, and
      Terragrunt will know to look directly in the stack directory
      for a given unit when supplied with no_dot_terragrunt_stack.
    - The runner-pool experiment no longer parses stack files as
      units during discovery
      A bug in the logic for the discovery package resulted in
      discovery errors due to terragrunt.stack.hcl files being
      parsed as units. That bug has been fixed.
    - Fixed filesystem context for find_in_parent_folders() when
      used in terragrunt.stack.hcl
      The use of find_in_parent_folders() now functions correctly
      when run in the context of a terragrunt.stack.hcl file.
      Previously, it relied on the current working directory of the
      Terragrunt CLI, which incorrectly assumed that users would
      always be generating terragrunt.stack.hcl files from the
      current working directory.
    - The discovery package now emits less false positive warnings
      during parsing
      The discovery package used by the find and list commands, and
      the runner-pool experiment has been updated to emit less
      unimportant warnings when parsing configurations. These
      warnings were for early phase parsing that are known to be
      safe to ignore.
    - The discovery package no longer attempts to parse stack
      configurations as units
      A bug in the implementation of the discovery package resulted
      in attempts from Terragrunt to parse terragrunt.stack.hcl
      files as units. That has been remediated.
  * Docs
    - Edit Link Added
      The terragrunt-v1.gruntwork.io docs now include an "Edit
      page" button that conveniently allows the community to
      contribute fixes to documentation from within their browsers,
      using the GitHub UI.

    - chore: Addressing review feedback (#4672)

Sun Aug 03 12:18:26 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 0.84.0:
  * Breaking Changes
    - Removal of legacy-all commands
      The following commands have been removed from the Terragrunt CLI:
      - spin-up
      - tear-down
      - plan-all
      - apply-all
      - destroy-all
      - output-all
      - validate-all
      If you have been using any of these commands, see the
      migration guide under Removal of longstanding deprecated
      commands here.
      This is the first step in the removal of deprecated features
      in Terragrunt on the road to Terragrunt 1.0, with more to
      follow. You are also advised to read the CLI Redesign
      migration documentation for future breaking changes.
      See #3535 for more details.
  * New Features
    - Catalog/Scaffold now support --no-dependency-prompt
      The catalog/scaffold commands now support a new
      --no-dependency-prompt flag that disables the Boilerplate
      dependency prompt (equivalent of --disable-dependency-prompt
      in Boilerplate).
      This allows Boilerplate templates with dependencies to be
      used non-interactively, even when called by Catalog and
      Scaffold.
    - exclude block now supports no_run
      The exclude block now supports the no_run attribute, which
      lets users prevent direct runs of a unit when the run matches
      the configuration of an exclude block.
      e.g. When users define an exclude block like the following:

        # foo/terragrunt.hcl
        exclude {
            if      = true
            actions = ["plan"]
        }

      Terragrunt will only exclude the unit foo from the run queue
      if the user supplies a command like run --all plan. If a user
      uses the run plan command directly in the foo directory, it’s
      assumed that they are doing so intentionally, and don’t want
      the run to exit early.
      Users can now specify no_run to explicitly tell Terragrunt
      that it should never be run, even if a user attempts to
      perform the run in the unit directory directly.

        # foo/terragrunt.hcl
        exclude {
            if      = true
            no_run  = true
            actions = ["plan"]
        }
  * Enhancements
    - Stacks are now fully regenerated when the --source-update
      flag is set
      The .terragrunt-stack directory is now fully regenerated when
      the --source-update flag is set, similar to how the
      .terragrunt-cache directory is regenerated when the flag is
      set.
      This addresses some edge-cases where changes to local sources
      for units and stacks didn’t result in updates to generated
      stack configurations.
  * Bug Fixes
    - Stack Outputs Are Now Sorted
      To ensure consistency in the order in which outputs are
      displayed when using the stack output command, outputs are
      now sorted before they are displayed.
    - Lockfiles With Strong Constraints Normalized
      When manually generating lockfiles from the Provider Cache
      Server for modules with strong constraints like the
      following:

        terraform {
          required_providers {
            aws = {
              source  = "hashicorp/aws"
              version = "= 5.100.0"
            }
          }
        }

      Generated lockfiles now properly strip the = when generating
      the lockfile, as = constraints aren’t supported in
      .terraform.lock.hcl files.

Thu Jul 03 04:50:12 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 0.82.4:
  * New Features
    - Support for OpenTofu 1.10 Native S3 Locking
      The remote_state S3 backend now integrates natively with the
      OpenTofu 1.10 feature of state locking via S3 without the
      usage of DynamoDB using the new use_lockfile attribute.

        # Configure OpenTofu/Terraform state to be stored in S3
        with native S3 locking instead of DynamoDB.
        # This uses S3 object conditional writes for state locking,
        which requires OpenTofu >= 1.10.
        remote_state {
          backend = "s3"
          config = {
            bucket       = "my-tofu-state"
            key          = "${path_relative_to_include()}/tofu.tfstate"
            region       = "us-east-1"
            encrypt      = true
            use_lockfile = true
          }
        }

      In previous releases, if users wanted to integrate with this
      OpenTofu feature, they would have to use the generate
      attribute, which opts users out of more advanced features of
      Terragrunt remote state management like automatic
      provisioning of state resources.
      By using the native attribute in config, users can retain the
      benefits of automatic backend bootstrapping in addition to
      native integration with the new OpenTofu feature.
      You can learn more about backend configurations in the HCL
      docs.
      https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/config-blocks-and-attributes/#backend
  * What's Changed
    - feat: Adding support for native state locking (#4485)
    - chore: update external dependencies (#4486)
    - fix: Use a constant for min version of tofu for auto provider
      cache dir (#4479)
    - fix: resolve failing CAS & DAG tests (#4480)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun 30 06:42:44 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 0.82.3:
  * Experiments Added
    - Introduction of the auto-provider-cache-dir experiment
      The new auto-provider-cache-dir experiment has been added to
      automatically configure OpenTofu provider caching when
      certain conditions are met:
      - You are using OpenTofu
      - You are using a version of OpenTofu >= 1.10
      This leverages recent improvements in how OpenTofu handles
      provider caching to allow for safe concurrent access to
      provider plugins in OpenTofu 1.10.
      In micro-benchmarks, the native provider cache directory
      out-performs the Provider Cache Server, as the overhead of
      starting and running the provider cache server is eliminated.
      Once generally available, this feature will be enabled by
      default, automatically providing performance improvements to
      Terragrunt users using OpenTofu >= 1.10. If you are currently
      using the Provider Cache Server, you are advised to
      experiment with this feature, and share your feedback.
      You can learn more about the feature in the dedicated feature
      docs, including a comparison with the Provider Cache Server,
      so you can learn if limitations in how the native OpenTofu
      provider cache directory will result in a requirement to
      continue using the Provider Cache Server going forward.
      https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/features/provider-cache-server/
      https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/features/auto-provider-cache-dir/
      https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/features/auto-provider-cache-dir/#comparison-with-provider-cache-server
  * New Features
    - --version-manager-file-name Flag Added
      During a run --all, Terragrunt memoizes the version of
      OpenTofu/Terraform being run to determine if version
      constraints are being satisfied, without doing unnecessary
      work to repeatedly check the version of OpenTofu/Terraform
      being run in each directory.
      To ensure that users using tool managers are able to leverage
      different versions of OpenTofu/Terraform in different
      directories, the cache key for this memoization includes
      calculations based on common version manager tools.
      By default, the following are detected:
        - .terraform-version
        - .tool-versions
        - .mise.toml
        - mise.toml
      To support the usage of any arbitrary tool manager, a new
      --version-manager-file-name flag has been introduced to allow
      configurability over this list.
      To learn more about --version-manager-file-name read the
      docs.
      https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/cli-options/#version-manager-file-name
  * What's Changed
    - feat: Adding auto provider cache dir experiment (#4466)
    - docs: Adding docs for local state to the side with stacks
      (#4477)
    - feat: add new `--version-cache-file` flag that allows users
      to override previously hardcoded values used for the
      `version` cache key; resolves #4326 (#4415)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun 30 06:38:49 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 0.82.2:
  * Bug Fixes
    - get_terragrunt_dir returns appropriate directory
      The get_terragrunt_dir() HCL function now returns the
      expected stack directory containing a terragrunt.stack.hcl
      when used in a terragrunt.stack.hcl file.
    - non-git default templates supported for Catalog/Scaffold
      A bug in how the default_template attribute of the catalog
      configuration block worked resulted in a requirement that the
      default template be a Git repository. That bug has been
      resolved, removing the restriction.
  * What's Changed
    - fix: Support non-git templates for Catalog/Scaffold (#4474)
    - build(deps): bump github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest (#4457)
    - build(deps): bump github.com/labstack/echo/v4 from 4.13.3 to
      4.13.4 (#4456)
    - Fix the inconsistent behaviour of get_terragrunt_dir function
      (#4443)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun 30 06:24:14 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 0.82.1:
  * Experiments Updated
    - The cas experiment now supports terraform block source
      attributes
      The cas experiment now supports de-duplication of
      OpenTofu/Terraform module source cloning during unit
      initialization.
      This both reduces time spent cloning OpenTofu/Terraform
      module sources by reducing network bandwidth overhead, and
      reduces disk utilization.
  * Bugs Fixed
    - The hcl validate command now returns an appropriate exit code
      When using hcl validate, if any unit fails validation when
      run against a stack of units, the final exit code will be
      non-zero when any unit fails validation.
      While this is technically a bugfix that is a 🛠️ breaking
      change in behavior, maintainers have opted to release this as
      part of a patch release, as it's what most users expect from
      the command and it's how the command is documented. We are
      also trying to reduce the number of minor releases on the
      road to 1.0 to make it easier to focus on the big changes
      that require significant adjustment in usage of Terragrunt,
      and want to make sure that users take special note of
      breaking removal of deprecated functionality.
      Avoiding the breaking change is fairly simple:
        terragrunt hcl validate || true
  * What's Changed
    - 4211 - fix: Setting correct exit code for `hcl validate`

- Update to version 0.82.0:
  * OpenTofu 1.10 support: We are now testing Terragrunt against
    OpenTofu 1.10, and is confirmed to be working.
    NOTE: Although this release is marked as backward incompatible,
    it is functionally compatible as nothing has been changed in
    Terragrunt internals. The minor version release is useful to
    mark the change in the OpenTofu version that is being tested.
  * What's Changed
    - Add support for OpenTofu 1.10 (#4465)

- Update to version 0.81.8:
  * New Features
    - Scaffold now supports Boilerplate dependencies and partials
      The Scaffold feature now supports leveraging Boilerplate
      dependencies and partials.
      This was a missing feature in the integration between
      Scaffold and Boilerplate, and Terragrunt users do not have to
      change anything in how they invoke Scaffold to have custom
      Boilerplate templates properly render using those Boilerplate
      features.
  * What's Changed
    - fix: Add scaffold support for boilerplate dependencies and
      partials (#4437)
    - Improve error message when terragrunt.hcl file does not exist
      (#4425)
    - build(deps): bump ruby/setup-ruby from 1.242.0 to 1.245.0

Mon Jun 16 19:22:48 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 0.81.7:
  * Experiments Updated
    - --summary-unit-duration replaced with --summary-per-unit
      Per design feedback, the flag --summary-unit-duration has
      been replaced with --summary-per-unit in the report
      experiment.
      This was done to streamline the information conveyed by the
      run summary, and to maximize leverage over the screen real
      estate taken by the summary.
      The report experiment is still ongoing, and community
      feedback is encouraged. Please share any feedback you may
      have before the design of Run Reports and Run Summaries are
      finalized.
  * What's Changed
    - fix: Replace summary unit durations (#4418)
    - fix: Adding E2E tests for catalog (#4424)

- Update to version 0.81.6:
  * Bug Fixes
    - The catalog command no longer panics during scaffolding
      A mistake in a refactor of internal logging caused a panic
      during scaffolding while using the Terragrunt Catalog
      Terminal User Interface (TUI).
      That bug has been fixed.
    - IaC Engines now properly handle errors during init and
      shutdown
      Some missing error handling in IaC Engines has been
      introduced to properly handle failed initialization and
      shutdown by IaC Engines.
  * What's Changed

- Update to version 0.81.4:
  * Experiments Updated
    The reports experiment now supports the --summary-unit-duration
    flag
    As part of delivering #3628 , the reports experiment has been
    updated to support optionally displaying unit-level duration
    information in the Run Summary.
    You can now optionally display the duration for each unit run
    as part of the Run Summary by adding the
    --summary-unit-duration flag to your run commands:
      $ terragrunt run --all plan --summary-unit-duration

      # Omitted for brevity...

      ❯❯ Run Summary
         Duration:   10m
            long-running-unit:    10m
            medium-running-unit:  12s
            short-running-unit:   5ms
         Units:      3
         Succeeded:  3

    By default, this information will be omitted.

- Update to version 0.81.3:
  * Experiments Updated
    - The reports experiment now supports generating reports in
      JSON format
      As part of delivering #3628 , the reports experiment has been
      updated to support JSON report generation in addition to the
      default of CSV report generation.
      To generate a report using JSON formatting, either use the
      --report-format flag to explicitly set the format to one of
      csv or json or provide a --report-file with a .csv or .json
      file extension to implicitly select the report format.
    - The reports experiment now supports generating a JSON schema
      for reports
      As part of delivering #3628 , the reports experiment has been
      updated to support generating a JSON schema following the
      JSON Schema specification in addition to generating reports.
      To generate a schema, use the --report-schema-file flag.

- Update to version 0.81.2:
  * Experiments Updated
    The reports experiment now supports generating reports
    As part of delivering #3628 , the reports experiment has been
    updated to support CSV report generation.
    When the reports experiment is enabled, and the --report-file
    argument is passed to a run --all / run --graph / stack run
    command, Terragrunt will generate a CSV report of the run in
    addition to the summary that is emitted by default.
    That report offers details on the outcome of each run in the
    Run Queue.

- Update to version 0.81.1:
  * Experiments Added
    The reports experiment has been added
    As part of delivering #3628 , the reports experiment has been
    added.  When enabled, Terragrunt will emit summaries of runs at
    the end of run --all commands.
    e.g.
      $ terragrunt run --all plan

      # Omitted for brevity...

      ❯❯ Run Summary
         Duration:   62ms
         Units:      3
         Succeeded:  3

    The summary can also be disabled using the --summary-disable
    flag, even when the experiment is active.
    You can learn more about this feature here.
    https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/features/run-report/
    More will be added in the near future to allow for report
    generation and customization. Stay tuned!

Tue Jun 03 04:56:06 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 0.81.0:
  * Breaking Changes
    - Bare Includes Deprecated
      Use of bare includes (include configuration blocks without a
      label) are now deprecated.
      For example:
        include {
            path = find_in_parent_folders("root.hcl")
        }
      Will now result in a deprecation warning, while the following usage of an include with a label added won't:
        include "root" {
            path = find_in_parent_folders("root.hcl")
        }
      Using labeled includes result in better performance, as
      backwards compatibility requires that Terragrunt does
      additional work during configuration processing. You are
      advised to update your bare includes to use labels as early
      as possible.
      Note that although this deprecation won't be an immediate
      breaking change. It will be a breaking change in the future.
      To opt-in to this breaking change today, you can use the
      bare-include strict control to mandate usage of the modern,
      labelled include. Doing so will ensure that you and your
      teammates are leveraging the most performant version of the
      configuration block.
      Backwards compatibility is guaranteed to remain present for
      this functionality until at least Terragrunt 2.0.
    - Logging Moved from Terragrunt Options
      If you depend on Terragrunt as a Golang library, you'll want
      to take note that this release introduces a breaking change
      to public functions in multiple packages to adjust how the
      logger is passed. The Terragrunt logger is no longer a member
      of the TerragruntOptions struct in the options package, and
      is instead passed explicitly as an argument to functions that
      need the logger.
      For example, the signature for the RunCommand function in the
      shell package changed from this:
        func RunCommand(ctx context.Context, opts *options.TerragruntOptions, command string, args ...string) error
      To this:
        func RunCommand(ctx context.Context, l log.Logger, opts *options.TerragruntOptions, command string, args ...string) error
      You maybe need to manually construct a logger to pass into
      public functions you are calling in Terragrunt packages as a
      consequence.
  * New Features
    - Added constraint_check HCL Function
      A new HCL function, constraint_check, has been added to
      Terragrunt.
      This HCL function allows you to drive logic in your
      configurations based on constraints checked against arbitrary
      semantic versions.
      For example:
        feature "module_version" {
          default = "1.2.3"
        }
        locals {
          module_version       = feature.module_version.value
          needs_v2_adjustments = constraint_check(local.module_version, ">= 2.0.0")
        }
        terraform {
          source = "github.com/my-org/my-module.git//?ref=v${local.module_version}"
        }
        inputs = !local.needs_v2_adjustments ? {
          old_module_input_name = "old_module_input_value"
        } : {
          new_module_input_name = "new_module_input_value"
        }
      Using this function, you can alter the behavior of units when
      particular OpenTofu/Terraform module versions are used,
      including changing inputs or altering error handling.

- Update to version 0.80.4:
  * New Features
    The exec command has gained support for use of the --tf-path
    flag. This can be important when Terragrunt incidentally uses
    OpenTofu/Terraform to do things like fetch outputs from
    dependencies.

Thu May 29 05:39:25 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 0.80.3:
  * Performance Improvements
    - Significant performance improvements for run --all
      The performance of run --all has been improved in two
      significant ways:
      1. Performance for named includes has improved.
         Backwards compatibility for bare includes required that
         Terragrunt do some inefficient work internally to handle
         both named includes and bare includes by doing an
         in-memory rewrite of Terragrunt configurations. An
         optimization has been introduced to avoid this behavior
         when users use named includes. This optimization does not
         extend to users that are using bare includes.
         Users are advised to avoid using bare includes whenever
         possible for maximum performance. A strict control has
         been introduced to enforce usage of named includes.
         In a future minor release, a warning will be emitted,
         instructing users to stop using bare includes. Maintainers
         will avoid breaking support for bare includes until at
         least 2.0.
         For more information on how to benefit from this
         optimization, see the migration guide.
      2. The check for OpenTofu/Terraform code has been optimized.
         To provide helpful error messages when users don't have
         OpenTofu/Terraform code for Terragrunt to run, Terragrunt
         checks for the presence of OpenTofu/Terraform
         configuration files (e.g. *.tf, *.tofu). This check has
         been optimized to improve performance.
      In a micro-benchmark on an M3 Max, using the
      BenchmarkManyEmptyTerragruntInits benchmark, which tests the
      performance of a Terragrunt run --all init across 1000 inits,
      the following performance gains were released:
        42% speed improvement.
        43% memory reduction.
      More optimizations of this sort are planned for future
      releases.
    - Size reduction of compiled binaries
      The size of compiled binaries will be reduced due to the
      stripping of debug symbols from the final executable. As an
      example, this drops the size of the compiled Linux AMD64
      binary from 99MB to 70MB.
      This can be a small improvement to download times for
      environments where Terragrunt is downloaded frequently.
  * Bug Fixes
    - Fixed -detailed-exitcode behavior in run --all
      An unintended side-effect of addressing a different bug for
      Terragrunt’s handling of the -detailed-exitcode flag in
      OpenTofu/Terraform in retries was that any run in a run --all
      could override the exit code of the entire run --all.
      This has been fixed. The exit code of the run --all -- plan
      -detailed-exitcode command will now properly aggregate exit
      codes from all runs in a run --all, only reseting the exit
      code for an individual unit if it properly recovers after a
      retry.

- Update to version 0.80.2:
  * New Features
    - find adds support for --include
      The find command now supports the --include flag to allow for
      fine grained control over the discovery of units that include
      other partial configurations.
  * Bug Fixes
    - --tf-path now correctly overrides terraform_binary
      A bug in the precedence logic for Terragrunt configuration
      parsing resulted in the CLI flag --tf-path from being ignored
      when the terraform_binary attribute was set.
      Terragrunt will now correctly respect the terraform_binary
      attribute when set, and allow --tf-path to override the value
      when it is set.

- Update to version 0.80.0:
  Terraform 1.12 support: We are now testing Terragrunt against
  Terraform 1.12 and is confirmed to be working.
  NOTE: Although this release is marked as backward incompatible,
  it is functionally compatible as nothing has been changed in
  Terragrunt internals. The minor version release is useful to mark
  the change in Terraform version that is being tested.

Thu May 22 04:52:33 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 0.79.3:
  * Enhancements
    - Limitation on Catalog URLs lifted
      A limitation on only supporting recognized go-getter URL
      patters has been lifted from the catalog command.
      The reason this limitation existed in the past was to ensure
      that users were able to have Terragrunt load module source
      code in browsers from the catalog Terminal User Interface
      (TUI). To support that, only a constrained set of sources
      were supported, to ensure that a button was available to pop
      open the link in the browser.
      Terragrunt will now dynamically adjust the buttons available
      after module selection to gracefully degrade the experience,
      instead of completely rejecting repository sources that can't
      be predictably converted to browser URLs.
      This allows more users to adopt the Terragrunt Catalog, while
      providing the same great user experience for users that are
      on fully supported platforms, like GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket,
      etc.

  * Enhancements
    The run --all command automatically generates Terragrunt Stacks
    If you are using terragrunt.stack.hcl files in your codebase,
    run --all commands will now automatically expand all
    terragrunt.stack.hcl files into generated stack configurations,
    as if you had run stack generate before running the run --all
    command.
    e.g.
      terragrunt run --all plan
    Is now equivalent to:
      terragrunt stack generate
      terragrunt run --all plan
    If you would like to disable this new behavior, you can use the
    --no-stack-generate to opt out of automatic stack generation.

  * New Features
    - OpenTelemetry Trace Propogation
      In anticipation of the introduction of OpenTelemetry support
      in OpenTofu 1.10, Terragrunt will now propagate the
      TRACEPARENT environment variable to child processes to
      support OpenTelemetry traces that maintain context across
      Terragrunt and OpenTofu.
      This work is based on @Yantrio 's PoC PR #4254, and is only

    after the CLI Redesign, read the CLI Redesign Migration Guide.
    The following are now deprecated:
    - hclfmt (use hcl fmt instead)
    - hclvalidate (use hcl validate instead)
    - validate-inputs (use hcl validate --inputs and hcl validate
      --inputs --strict instead)
    - terragrunt-info (use info print instead)
    - output-module-groups (use find --dag --json instead)
    - render-json (use render --json -w instead)
    - graph-dependencies (use dag graph instead)
    - run-all (use run --all instead)
    - graph (use run --graph instead)
    - The default command. e.g. terragrunt workspace list (use
      terragrunt run -- workspace list instead)
    - Default bootstrap (automatically provisioning backend
      resources without additional flags). This is now opt in
      behavior, and requires usage of the --backend-bootstrap flag
      or explicitly running the new backend bootstrap command.
    - aws-provider-patch (we are simply deprecating this command,
      and removing it when the other commands are removed. It
      served its purpose as a short term stopgap tool).
    Note that this will not result in an immediate breaking change
    for users, as we’ll have an initial deprecation window to give
    users time to adjust to these changes. If you’d like to ensure
    that you are prepared for the future removal of legacy
    commands, you can take advantage of the cli-redesign strict
    control to opt in to the future breaking change early.
  * Enhancements

- Update to version 0.77.21:
  * New Features
    - Introduction of hcl commands
      As part of the CLI Redesign experiment, the hcl commands have
      been introduced.
      The hcl commands allow users to directly interact with HCL
      content independent of the underlying functionality they
      support.
      The functionality of the hcl commands replace existing
      functionality that is soon to be deprecated:
        hclfmt --> hcl fmt
        hclvalidate --> hcl validate
        validate-inputs --> hcl validate --inputs
        validate-inputs --strict-validate --> hcl validate --inputs --strict

- Update to version 0.77.18:
  * New Features
    - Support for HCL formatting with the render command
      As part of the CLI Redesign experiment, the render command
      now supports HCL formatting for rendered configurations,
      which is the default output format.
      Using the render command with HCL formatting allows users to
      get a quick, minimal evaluation of Terragrunt unit
      configurations with as much pre-processing done as possible.
      Using the render command with HCL formatting offers a way to
      resolve complex HCL function evaluation, include merging or
      string interpolation, etc. to achieve equivalent Terragrunt
      HCL configurations that are easier to reason about.

- Update to version 0.77.17:
  * New Features
    - Introduction of the render command
      As part of the CLI Redesign experiment, the render command
      has been introduced.
      The render command allows users to easily render Terragrunt
      unit configurations with reduced complexity, making it easier
      to understand configurations at a glance.
      The introduction of the render command is part of the
      eventual deprecation of the existing render-json command,
      which will be deprecated by the end of the CLI Redesign. The
      render command is a higher level command, that offers the
      ability to write to stdout, in addition to writing to files,
      and will support HCL configurations in addition to JSON
      (coming soon).
      To learn more about the render command, read the official
      documentation here.

- Update to version 0.77.16:
  * New Features
    - Introduction of the backend migrate command
      As part of the CLI Redesign experiment, the backend migrate
      command has been introduced.
      The backend migrate command allows you to simply migrate
      state between different units (or renames of units) without
      manually running OpenTofu/Terraform state migration commands.
      To learn more about the backend migrate command, read the
      official docs.

- Update to version 0.77.14:
  * New Features
    Support for --exclude and --queue-construct-as in find and list
    The find and list commands have been updated to leverage new
    capabilities involving greater understanding of the Terragrunt
    run queue.
    Users can now leverage the --queue-construct-as (or just --as)
    flag in the find and list commands to discover configurations
    as if a particular Terragrunt command was being run (e.g. plan,
    destroy).
    The find and list commands will now construct the Terragrunt
    run queue as if a particular command was being run, potentially
    altering the position of elements in the run queue, based on
    their dependencies (dependencies before dependents for plans,
    applies, etc. and dependents before dependencies for destroys).
    In addition, users can leverage the --exclude flag on the find
    command to get information on the exclude block included in
    results. The exclude block is also factored in to discovery
    results when the --queue-construct-as flag is passed, allowing
    users to dry-run behavior of the exclude block before
    performing any Terragrunt runs.

  * New Features
    Introduced no_validation attribute for stack and unit, allowing
    users to bypass Terragrunt's validation checks when deploying
    infrastructure. This is particularly useful in scenarios where
    you need to deploy infrastructure that doesn't strictly adhere
    to Terragrunt's validation rules, such as during emergency
    deployments or when working with legacy infrastructure
    patterns.

- Update to version 0.77.4:
  * Bug fixes
    - Newlines reduced in Error Logging for Configuration Errors
      Logging for configuration errors has been compacted to reduce
      noise, and make errors easier to read.
    - Improved Cycle Detection Logic for stack generate
      On the default filesystem for macOS, path length was likely
      to result in an error before internal cycle detection logic,
      so cycle detection was updated to leverage a maximum path
      length of 1024 characters as an earlier exit for all
      operating systems.
    - Excessive warning for bootstrap requirement resolved
      Internal logic for determination that backends required
      bootstrapping was adjusted to no longer leverage the value of
      the OpenTofu state file.
      While cheaper than making a network request to assess the
      current state of backend resources, it also resulted in false
      negatives, which triggered excessive backend bootstrap
      warnings.
  * What's Changed
    - fix: New lines in TF diagnostic log by @levkohimins in #4108
    - fix: Stack cycles detection improvements by @denis256 in

Mon Mar 31 18:51:41 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 0.77.3:
  * Enhancements
    Error Handling for Discovery
    The find and list commands now leverage improved error handling
    when discovering configurations throughout Terragrunt projects.
    When configurations require authentication due to usage of
    functionality like get_aws_account_id(), have errors in their
    configurations or cycles between dependencies, the commands
    will do their best to return valid results, and warn the user
    that the results are incomplete due to suppressed errors or cut
    cycles.
    This should allow for usage of the find and list commands in
    more real-world use-cases, which frequently require this kind
    of error handling.
  * What's Changed
    - feat: Adding error handling for discovery by @yhakbar in
      #4098

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 31 18:45:23 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 0.77.2:
  * New Features
    The backend configuration block now supports
    assume_role_with_web_identity for configuring the backend block
    of the OpenTofu/Terraform terraform block.
    This allows users separately authenticating to backends with a
    different role to leverage role assumption with OIDC.
    For more information, see the backend docs.

    - Improved error handling by adding a test check for
      non-existent stack and unit paths, ensuring clearer messages
      when expected files are missing.
  * What's Changed
    - feat: added support for reading stack configuration and
      values files by @denis256 in #4085

Fri Mar 28 14:48:26 UTC 2025 - opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de

- Update to version 0.77.0:
  * Breaking Changes
    - Best Effort Parsing
      Exported functions like ParseConfig and ParseConfigString now
      perform best effort parsing instead of early returns.
      Consumers of Terragrunt as a library should be aware of this
      change, as it can result in partially parsed configurations
      being returned instead of nil when errors are encountered
      during parsing. As a consumer of these functions, you are
      responsible for checking the errors being returned, and
      handling the returned configuration value accordingly.
      These changes are being introduced to support greater parsing
      flexibility for usage in the find and list command, which
      will be able to handle partial parse failures while still
      returning valuable information, along with the Terragrunt
      LSP, which needs the same adjustments to parsing.
    - Struct Field Alignment
      The fieldalignment govet lint has been introduced to the
      codebase, and all structs that had less efficient struct
      field alignment have been updated to minimize their memory
      footprint. If you are consuming Terragrunt as a library, you
      may have to make changes to how you are leveraging exported
      structs from Terragrunt.
      The simplest way to avoid any breakage related to this change
      is to avoid usage of unkeyed composite literals.
      See the release for details:
      https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/tag/v0.77.0
    - Telemetry Environment Variable Name Changes
      The following environment variables now have new aliases:
      - TERRAGRUNT_TELEMETRY_TRACE_EXPORTER --> TG_TELEMETRY_TRACE_EXPORTER
      - TERRAGRUNT_TELEMETRY_TRACE_EXPORTER_HTTP_ENDPOINT --> TG_TELEMETRY_TRACE_EXPORTER_HTTP_ENDPOINT
      - TERRAGRUNT_TELEMETRY_TRACE_EXPORTER_INSECURE_ENDPOINT --> TG_TELEMETRY_TRACE_EXPORTER_INSECURE_ENDPOINT
      - TERRAGRUNT_TELEMETRY_METRIC_EXPORTER --> TG_TELEMETRY_METRIC_EXPORTER
      - TERRAGRUNT_TELEMETRY_METRIC_EXPORTER_INSECURE_ENDPOINT --> TG_TELEMETRY_METRIC_EXPORTER_INSECURE_ENDPOINT
      These environment variables have been renamed to align more
      closely with the rest of the changes in the CLI Redesign.
      Note that the TRACEPARENT environment variable has not
      changed. This environment variable is semi-standard in the
      OpenTelemetry space, so we've preserved it.
      This is not a breaking change with this release, but will be
      in the future. As with all the environment variable renames
      that have taken place during the CLI Redesign, both the
      legacy environment variable and the new environment variable
      will be supported to give users time to make requisite
      adjustments. If you would like to opt in to stricter behavior
      that requires usage of the new environment variables,
      leverage the terragrunt-prefix-env-vars strict control.
  * New Features
    - Introduction of backend bootstrap and backend delete
      This release introduces two new commands named backend
      bootstrap and backend delete.
      These commands allow for manual control over the process by
      which Terragrunt can manage backend state resources on behalf
      of users.
    - backend bootstrap
      The backend bootstrap command allows users to explicitly
      bootstrap resources like S3 buckets, GCS buckets, DynamoDB
      tables, etc. used to manage state for OpenTofu/Terraform.
      It is accompanied by a flag (--backend-bootstrap) which
      explicitly enables this behavior by default before performing
      any operation that might require backend resources (like the
      run command).
      The introduction of this command is part of the future
      deprecation of provisioning backend resources by default when
      using Terragrunt. You can learn more about this in the CLI
      Redesign.
    - backend delete
      The backend delete command allows users to delete state
      resources relevant to one or more units in remote state.
      Terragrunt performs two safety checks to mitigate the risk of
      accidentally removing the wrong backend state resource:
      1. By default, Terragrunt will refuse to remove any backend
         state file if versioning is not enabled for the backend S3
         bucket or GCS bucket. To explicitly ignore this safety
         check, users must provide the --force flag.
      2. By default, Terragrunt will prompt users to confirm their
         decision to remove a given backend state file. To
         explicitly ignore this safety check, users must provide
         the --non-interactive flag.
      The introduction of this command is part of a larger effort
      to provide users greater control over the full lifecycle of
      backend state resources by Terragrunt. You can learn more
      about this in the CLI Redesign.

- Update to version 0.76.8:
  * New Features
    OpenTofu file extension detection
    OpenTofu-specific file extensions (*.tofu and *.tofu.json) are
    detected by default, just like generic *.tf, *.tf.json files,
    which are used by both OpenTofu and Terraform.
    This ensures that future incompatibility between OpenTofu and
    Terraform which specifically requires usage of the *.tofu file
    extension will be supported without additional effort.
    Thank you to @wazy for contributing this new feature.

- Update to version 0.76.3:
  * Breaking Changes
    - find --sort=dag changed to find --dag
      The experimental find command no longer has a --sort flag.
      Instead the ability to sort configurations according to their
      position in the DAG has been replaced with the dedicated
      --dag flag, which puts the command in "DAG Mode". These
      changes have been done to allow for closer parity in the
      behavior of find and list.

        # Before
        terragrunt find --sort=dag
        # After
        terragrunt find --dag

  * New Features
    - Introduction of the list command
      As part of the CLI Redesign experiment, the list command has
      been introduced. As with other new features, usage requires
      enabling the CLI Redesign experiment.
      The list command helps you discover and display Terragrunt
      configurations in your codebase. It provides various output
      formats and options to help you understand the structure and
      dependencies of your Terragrunt configurations.
      The list command is very similar to the find command. It uses
      the same backend logic for configuration discovery. It also
      supports very similar flags and configuration options.
      Generally, the list command is optimized for displaying
      configurations in a format that is easy for a human to read
      and understand, so there are more configuration options, and
      the output is more verbose. Output from the list command can
      vary significantly depending on the flags used, and the
      output structure is more variable than that of the find
      command.
      Use the list command when you want to visualize your
      Terragrunt configurations in a human-readable format. Use the
      find command when you want to programmatically search for
      configurations in your codebase.
      Usage

- Update to version 0.76.2:
  * New Features
    - Added --no-stack-generate support in stack run and stack
      output, allowing users to disable automatic stack
      regeneration before executing commands. This provides greater
      control over execution by enabling operations to run using
      the existing .terragrunt-stack directory, improving
      efficiency and avoiding unnecessary updates.

- Update to version 0.76.1:
  * New Features
    Introduced no_dot_terragrunt_stack support in stack and unit,

    directories. This enables seamless adoption of
    terragrunt.stack.hcl without requiring state migration for
    existing infrastructure.

- Update to version 0.76.0:
  * New Features / Breaking Changes
    - Catalog/Scaffold no longer requires --root-file-name root.hcl
      The catalog and scaffold commands will now attempt to
      discover a parent root.hcl file by default and use it as the
      default root Terragrunt configuration when present to help
      users adopt the changes in
      migrating-from-root-terragrunt-hcl.
      Users that have switched over to use root.hcl as the root of
      their Terragrunt configurations instead of terragrunt.hcl
      will no longer need to explicitly pass --root-file-name
      root.hcl or use the root-terragrunt-hcl strict control to
      automatically discover the root of their Terragrunt
      configurations when using catalog or scaffold.
      Note that this is technically a breaking change to the way
      that catalog and scaffold work. With this change, users that
      have both a root.hcl file and a terragrunt.hcl file at the
      root of their repositories will have the root.hcl file used
      instead of the terragrunt.hcl file for the catalog and
      scaffold commands.
      If you are not yet ready to rename the terragrunt.hcl file at
      the root of your repository, use the --root-file-name flag to
      explicitly provide terragrunt.hcl as the name of the
      Terragrunt configuration at the root of your Terragrunt
      project.
      This change was made as most users are very unlikely to have
      both root.hcl (the recommended root of Terragrunt
      configurations) and terragrunt.hcl (the legacy root of
      Terragrunt configurations in the same Terragrunt project) at
      the root of their Terragrunt project. This configuration is
      entirely CLI based, making it relatively easy to address for
      users (as opposed to HCL configurations, which might take
      more time for teams to address).
      Users looking to move from a root terragrunt.hcl file to a
      root.hcl file will still need to read through the migration
      guide to adjust all usages of find_in_parent_folders when
      making the switch.
  * What's Changed
    - fix: Lookup root.hcl if present by @yhakbar in #4022
    - fix: Improving logic for scaffold default root discovery by
      @yhakbar in #4029
    - fix: Fixing configuration parsing order link by @yhakbar in

  * Bug fixes
    - Using absolute paths for mark_as_read
      The internal store for the values mark_as_read was tracking
      now use absolute paths instead of "canonical paths". The
      result of this is that even if you are using tooling like
      run_cmd to dynamically discover files to mark as read, you
      should still expect --queue-include-units-reading to work
      correctly.

  * New Features
    - find supports dag sorting
      The find command now supports the ability to sort results by
      their relative positions in the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
      To use the find command, you must enable the cli-redesign
      experiment.
    - The stack run command now supports all run flags
      The stack run command now supports all the same flags run
      supports, including --queue-include-dir.
      To use stack commands, you must enable the stacks experiment.
      As an example of what's supported now:

        terragrunt --experiment stacks stack run apply --queue-strict-include --queue-include-dir=./.terragrunt-stack/app1 --non-interactive

      More information can be found in the stack run docs.

- Update to version 0.75.5:
  * New Features
    This release introduces experimental support for the Terragrunt
    Content Addressable Store (CAS).
    To enable this feature, you must use the cas experiment.
    When using the CAS, the catalog command will store its contents
    in a CAS to deduplicate repository contents, then construct the
    resultant repo from the CAS.
    You can use Git URLs for the catalog command normally, and when
    the cas experiment is enabled, Terragrunt will leverage the CAS
    to save you clone time and disk space:

    catalog {
      urls = [
        "git@github.com:acme/modules.git"
      ]
    }

    There are more planned integration points for the CAS, but for
    now only the catalog command is supported.
    You can learn more about the CAS in the feature documentation.

- Update to version 0.73.0:
  * Breaking Changes
    - Removal of terragrunt- prefix in flags
      All Terragrunt CLI flags no longer start with the terragrunt-
      prefix. This will not immediately break workflows, but will
      start to emit warnings for users.
      We will announce removal of support for flags without the
      terragrunt- prefix well in advance, and it will be done in a
      future minor release before v1.0.
      You can opt in to making this a breaking change today via
      usage of the terragrunt-prefix-flags strict control.
    - Rename of TERRAGRUNT_ prefixed environment variables
      All Terragrunt environment variables are no longer prefixed
      with TERRAGRUNT_, but are now instead prefixed with TG_. This
      will not immediately break workflows, but will start to emit
      warnings for users.
      We do not currently have plans to remove support for
      environment variables with the TERRAGRUNT_ prefix, and are
      aiming to support them after the release of v1.0, as we know
      this can be a more difficult configuration to change.
      You can opt in to making this a breaking change today via
      usage of the terragrunt-prefix-env-vars strict control.
    - Removal of support for the Terragrunt default command
      Prior to this release, Terragrunt would forward all commands
      that were not defined in the Terragrunt CLI directly to
      OpenTofu/Terraform. With the introduction of the new run
      command, this behavior is no longer necessary, nor desirable.
      In addition to supporting the new run command, Terragrunt now
      also supports explicit OpenTofu shortcuts. You can learn more
      about both below.
      We will announce removal of support for the default command
      of Terragrunt well in advance, and it will be done in a
      future minor release before v1.0.
      You can opt in to making this a breaking change today via
      usage of the default-command strict control.
  * New Features
    All of the features released in this release require usage of
    the cli-redesign experiment.
    - New run command
      This command replaces what used to be the responsibility of
      the default command in Terragrunt. Going forward, when users
      want to explicitly have Terragrunt run an OpenTofu/Terraform
      command on their behalf, they'll use the run command.
      In a future release, this command will also gain the two
      following flags to replace the functionality of the run-all
      and graph commands:
        --all: Replaces the run-all command.
        --graph: Replaces the graph command.
      You can learn more about the run command here:
      https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/cli-options/#run
    - New exec command
      This command provides tooling to explicitly execute an
      arbitrary command using Terragrunt (even if it's not related
      to OpenTofu/Terraform). It users additional control over
      exactly what Terragrunt does when it's executing a command,
      and gives them additional flexibility they wouldn't have
      otherwise.
      You can learn more about the exec command here:
      https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/cli-options/#exec
    - New info strict command
      The new info strict command gives users a quick way to
      determine which strict controls are available in the
      Terragrunt CLI using the terminal.
      We'll be making updates in the near future to update the
      UI/UX of the command, but we've released an early version for
      preview via the cli-redesign experiment flag.
