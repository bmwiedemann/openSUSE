Fri Jul  3 09:59:22 UTC 2020 - Fridrich Strba <fstrba@suse.com>

- Update to 1.6.0
  * Summary of changes in 1.6.0:
    + Faster target platform resolution
      Tycho needs to resolve the target platform during the initial
      phase of a build. This is now much faster than before, thanks
      to improved caching. In an example application with 800
      bundles in its target platform Tycho 1.5 needs about 2 seconds
      per Maven module for target platform resolution, while Tycho
      1.6 needs about 0.2 seconds per Maven module.
    + Drop support for obsolete modular JVMs (10 and 12)
      Due to Equinox no longer shipping EEs (they kind of lost sense
      with modular JVMs which may or may not include a module) these
      EEs are shipped as part of Tycho now, but it can't go
      indefinitely. Dropped Java 10 and 12 which are no longer
      supported versions already.
    + Plexus Utils has been updated to version 3.3.0 as a prereq for
      other dependency updates. 
  * Summary of changes in 1.5.0:
    + Pomless Build
      The pomless build has been improved to support some new
      features and improve existing ones
    + FreeBSD support
    + Thread stack traces dump before forkedProcessTimeoutInSeconds
      timeout occurs
      The parameter forkedProcessTimeoutInSeconds can be specified
      to kill the process which runs tests (also prior to Tycho
      1.5.0). With the change for bug 542876, a few minutes before
      the process is killed due to this timeout, thread stack traces
      are dumped in the test log. I.e. when a timeout occurs (e.g.
      due to a deadlock) the logs would now contain some indication
      of which code causes the timeout.
    + A Mojo to list dependencies. A new
      org.eclipse.tycho.extras:tycho-dependency-tools-plugin:list-dependencies mojo
      can list the bundles resulting of dependency resolution for
      Tycho projects.
    + ECJ has been updated to version 3.19.0. This version adds
      support for Java 12 bytecode and features.
    + JGit has been updated to version 5.5.0.
    + Equinox and p2 has been updated to their 2019-09 versions.
  * Summary of changes in 1.4.0:
    + ObjectWeb ASM has been updated to version 7.0 from 5.0.3 which
      provides Java 11 compatibility in artifactcomparator.
      Note: Due to upstream no longer producing
      org.ow2.asm:asm-debug-all Tycho now requires
      org.ow2.asm:asm-tree and org.ow2.asm:asm-util.
    + Resolving Java 11 removed modules
      Java 11 removed a number of modules which broke
      compilation/tests/resolving deps when the bundle has lower
      BREE as they were resolved from the BREE profile. Now Tycho
      will check if runtime Java is 11+ and if it differs from
      bundle's EE - in this case it will resolve deps with current
      runtime's EE.
    + Performance improvement using Git timestamp provider
      If you have configured Tycho to create reproducable version
      qualifiers, then Tycho will calculate the qualifier from the
      underlying git history.
    + ECJ has been updated to version 3.17.0 from 3.15.1. This
      version brings support for Java 11 bytecode and features.
  * Summary of changes in 1.3.0
    + Java 11: JDT was updated to 3.15.1 (we are now using ecj
      binaries from  maven central as opposed to jdt.core and
      jdt.compiler.apt) to support compiling against Java 11
    + Tycho 1.3.0 surefire plugin supports starting applications
      that use org.apache.felix.scr bundle in place of
      org.eclipse.equinox.ds (like Eclipse Platform 4.10 based
      target-platforms)
    + download.stats artifact metadata property
      Support for download.stats property on artifacts metadata.
      In order to (partially) enable p2 download stats as
      documented in Equinox_p2_download_stats, you can now configure
      you tycho-p2-plugin:p2-metadata generateDownloadStats
      parameter to add the necessary property on the artifacts or
      alternatively, you can override the
      tycho.generateDownloadStatsProperty property either by CLI
      with mvn -Dtycho.generateDownloadStatsProperty=true ... or
      by adding
        <tycho.generateDownloadStatsProperty>
          true
        </tycho.generateDownloadStatsProperty>
      in the <properties> element of your pom.xml.
    + Extra artifact repository properties (like p2.statsURI or
      p2.mirrorsURL)
      The tycho-p2-repository-plugin:assemble-repository plugin now
      accepts a extraArtifactRepositoryProperties parameter to
      configure addition properties to add to the artifact
      repository.
    + Configure trimStackTrace in Tycho Surefire
      Maven Surefire aggressively trims stack traces in test case
      failure reports, which can lead to confusion where an
      error/exception actually happened. To avoid that Tycho
      Surefire now allows configuring the trimStackTrace property as
      in Maven Surefire.
    + The Maven Surefire plugins had been updated to v2.22.0 and are
      now using the Surefire JUnit 5 Platform Provider (prior Tycho
      used the JUnit 5 Platform Provider from the JUnit Team).
      So the provider specific properties (e.g. "excludeTag") might
      not work anymore.
