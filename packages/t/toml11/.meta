  <title>TOML for Modern C++</title>
  <description>toml11 is a C++11 (or later) header-only toml parser/encoder depending only on C++ standard library.
 
  * It is compatible to the latest version of TOML v1.0.0.
  * It is one of the most TOML standard compliant libraries, tested with the
    language agnostic test suite for TOML parsers by BurntSushi.
  * It shows highly informative error messages.
  * It has configurable container. You can use any random-access containers
    and key-value maps as backend containers.
  * It optionally preserves comments without any overhead.
  * It has configurable serializer that supports comments, inline tables,
    literal strings and multiline strings.
  * It supports user-defined type conversion from/into toml values.
  * It correctly handles UTF-8 sequences, with or without BOM, both on posix
    and Windows.</description>
