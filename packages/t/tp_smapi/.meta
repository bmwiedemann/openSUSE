Description
-----------

ThinkPad laptops include a proprietary interface called SMAPI BIOS
(System Management Application Program Interface) which provides some
hardware control functionality that is not accessible by other means.

This driver exposes some features of the SMAPI BIOS through a sysfs
interface. It is suitable for newer models, on which SMAPI is invoked
through IO port writes. Older models use a different SMAPI interface;
for those, try the &quot;thinkpad&quot; module from the &quot;tpctl&quot; package.</description>
