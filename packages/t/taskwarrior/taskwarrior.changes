- Update to 3.1.0
 * Support for task purge has been restored, and new support added for
   automatically expiring old tasks. (#3540, #3546, #3556)
 * task news is now better behaved, and can be completely disabled.
 * Multiple imports of the same UUID will now generate a warning. (#3560)
 * The sync.server.url config replaces sync.server.origin and allows a URL
   containing a path. (#3423)
 * The new bubblegum-256.theme has improved legibility and contrast over
   others. (#3505)
 * Warnings regarding .data files are only show for reports. (#3473)
 * Inherited urgency is correctly calculated to make parents more urgent than
   children (#2941)
 * Task completion commands no longer trigger hooks (#3133)
- Refreshed:
  * task-skip-INSTALL.patch
  * vendor.tar.zst

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr 24 22:20:30 UTC 2024 - Joshua Smith <smolsheep@opensuse.org>

- Updated task-skip-INSTALL.patch to current CMakeLists.txt
- Add _service file and vendor the new rust dependencies
- Remove unneeded __TIME__/__DATE__ replacement (Fixed in PR#2494)
- Update to 3.0.2:
  * Fix an accidentally-included debug print which polluted output
    of reports with the Taskwarrior version
  * Fix an error in creation of the 3.0.0 tarball which caused
    builds to fail
  * Improvements to `task news`, including notes for the 3.0.0
    release
  * Minor improvements to documentation and error handling
  * Fix incorrect task ID of 0 when using hooks
  * Issue a warning if .data files remain
  * [BREAKING CHANGE] the sync functionality has been rewritten
    entirely, and no longer supports taskserver/taskd. Instead, the
    recommended solution is a cloud-storage backend, although
    `taskchampion-sync-server` is also available.
  * The Taskwarrior build no longer requires GnuTLS. The build
    option `ENABLE_SYNC=OFF` is also no longer supported; sync
    support is always built in.
  * Fix urgency inheritance for negative-urgency tasks.
  * `task show` now shows `hooks.location.
  * Fix leading space before urgency value in `task info`.
  * Fix formatting of countdown-style dates
  * Fix issue with filter not applied correctly during `task _tags`
    command
  * Parsing of timestamp values now uses 64-bit integers, avoiding
    issues in the year 2032.
  * Fix fish completion.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb 21 15:04:53 UTC 2024 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

  %patchN.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr 13 16:59:00 UTC 2022 - Ferdinand Thiessen <rpm@fthiessen.de>

  * Fix the bulk removal of depends: and tags: is ignored
  * Fix tag exclusion should be detected as invalid write context
  * Fix the value of soww named date is incorrect
  * Fix corruption of the depends attribute upon syncing with
    taskd 1.1.0
  * Fix assigning dependencies via ID ranges
  * Fix recurring report does not include parent tasks

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Nov 28 20:00:55 UTC 2021 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 2.6.1:
  - The logic behind new-uuid verbosity option changed. New-uuid now overrides
    new-id if set and will cause Taskwarrior to display UUIDs instead of IDs
    for new tasks (machine friendly).
  - If ~/.taskrc is not found, Taskwarrior will look for its configuration in
    $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/task/taskrc (defaulting to ~/.config/task/taskrc). This
    allows users to setup their Taskwarrior to follow XDG standard without
    using config overrides.
  - Newer Unicode characters, such as emojis are correctly handled and displayed.
    Taskwarrior now supports all Unicode characters up to Unicode 12.
  - Datetime values until year 9999 are now supported.
    Duration values of up to 1 000 000 years are now supported.
  - 64-bit numeric values (up to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807) are now supported.
  - Later/someday named datetime values now resolve to 9999-12-30 (instead of
    2038-01-18).
  - Calendar now supports displaying due dates until year 9999.
  - Calendar now displays waiting tasks with due dates on the calendar.
  - Calendar supports highlighting days with scheduled tasks.
  - Multi-day holidays are now supported.
  - Holiday data files for fr-CA, hu-HU, pt-BR, sk-SK and sv-FI locales are now
    generated and shipped with Taskwarrior.
  - The task edit command can now handle multi-line annotations and UDAs in a
    user friendly way, withouth having to handle with JSON escaping of special
    chars.
  - A large portion of currently known parser-related issues was fixed.
  - The taskrc file now supports relative paths, which are evaluated with
    respect to (a) current directory, (b) taskrc directory and (c) now also the
    installation directory of configuration files.
  - The currently selected context is now applied for "task add" and "task log"
    commands. Section on contexts in the manpage was updated to describe this
    functionality.
  - Users can specify per-context specific overrides of configuration variables.
  - The `task import` command can now accept annotations with missing entry
    values. Current time will be assumed.
  - The new 'by' filter attribute modifier compares using '<=' rather than '<'
    as 'before' uses.  This allows the last second of the day to match with
    'due.by:eod', which it would not otherwise.  It also works with
    whole units like days, e.g. 'add test due:2021-07-17' would not match
    'due.before:tomorrow' (on the 16th), but would match 'due.by:tomorrow'.
  - Waiting is now an entirely "virtual" concept, based on a task's
    'wait' property and the current time. Task is considered "waiting" if its
    wait attribute is in the future. TaskWarrior no longer explicitly
    "unwaits" a task (the wait attribute is not removed once its value is in
    the past), so the "unwait' verbosity token is no longer available.
    This allows for filtering for tasks that were waiting in the past
    intervals, but are not waiting anymore.
  - The configuration file now supports environment variables.
  - Taskwarrior can now handle displaying tasks in windows with limited width,
    even if columns contain long strings (like URLs).
  - The nag message is emitted at most once per task command, even with bulk
    operations. Additionally, the urgency of the task considered is taken
    before the completion, not after.
  - The export command now takes an optional argument that references an
    existing report. As such, "task export <report>" command will export
    the same tasks that "task <report>" prints, and in the same order.
  - The burndown command now supports non-cumulative display, where tasks only
    get plotted within the interval segment when they got completed.
