%description
Torsocks allows you to use most applications in a safe way with Tor.
It ensures that DNS requests are handled safely and explicitly rejects
any traffic other than TCP from the application you're using.

Torsocks is an ELF shared library that is loaded before all others.
The library overrides every needed Internet communication libc function
calls such as connect(2) or gethostbyname(3).

This process is transparent to the user and if torsocks detects any
communication that can't go through the Tor network such as UDP traffic,
for instance, the connection is denied. If, for any reason, there is no way
for torsocks to provide the Tor anonymity guarantee to your application,
torsocks will force the application to quit and stop everything.

Adjust when needed /etc/tor/torsocks.conf and use Torsocks with

    torsocks application

So, for example you can use ssh to a some.ssh.com by doing

    torsocks ssh -p SSH-Port -i ~/.ssh/ssh-key.rsa username@some.ssh.com

You can use in /etc/bash.bashrc.local or /etc/zsh.zshrc.local alias

    alias slogin-='torsocks slogin'

And can ajust ~/.ssh/config with your data for server or PC and then use simple

    slogin- server

or add too an alias

    alias slogin-server='slogin- server'

and use simple

    slogin-server
