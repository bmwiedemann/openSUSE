  <summary>Tool for the Design of Origami Bases</summary>
  <description>
    <p>
      TreeMaker is a program for the design of origami bases. You draw a stick figure
      of the base on the screen; each stick in the stick figure (the “tree”) will be
      represented by a flap on the base. You can also place various constraints on
      the flaps, forcing them to be corner, edge, or middle flaps, and/or setting up
      various symmetry relationships (forcing pairs of flaps to be symmetric about a
      line of symmetry of the paper, for example). Once you have defined the tree,
      TreeMaker computes the full crease pattern for a base which, when folded, will
      have a projection (roughly speaking, its “shadow”) equivalent to that specified
      by the defining tree. The crease pattern can be printed out, or copied and
      pasted into another graphics program for further processing.
