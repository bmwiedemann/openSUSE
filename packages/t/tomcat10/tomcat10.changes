Tue Jul  9 12:52:37 UTC 2024 - Ricardo Mestre <ricardo.mestre@suse.com>

- Update to Tomcat 10.1.25
  * Fixed CVEs:
    + CVE-2024-34750: Improper handling of exceptional conditions
      (bsc#1227399)
  * Catalina
    + Add: Add support for shallow copies when using WebDAV. (markt)
    + Code: Deprecate the WebdavFixFilter as it is no longer required. (markt)
    + Fix: 69066: Fix regression in SPNEGO authenticator when processing Base64.
      Submitted by Daniel Lyko. (remm)
    + Add: Add RealmBase.getPrincipal(GSSName, GSSCredential, GSSContext) for
      retrieving extended/additional information from an established GSS
      context. (michaelo)
    + Fix: Correct a regression in the fix for 68721 that caused some instances
      of LinkageError to be reported as ClassNotFoundException. (markt)
    + Fix: Ensure that static resources deployed via a JAR file remain
      accessible when the context is configured to use a bloom filter. Based on
      pull request #730 provided by bergander. (markt)
    + Add: Introduce reference counting so the AprLifecycleListener is more
      robust. This particularly targets more complex embedded configurations
      with multiple server instances with independent lifecycles where more than
      one server instance requires the AprLifecycleListener. (markt)
    + Add: Small performance optimization when logging cookies with no values.  
      (schultz)
    + Fix: Correct error handling for asynchronous requests. If the application
      performs an dispatch during AsyncListener.onError() the dispatch is now
      performed rather than completing the request using the error page
      mechanism. (markt)
    + Add: Re-factor ElapsedTimeElement in AbstractAccessLogValve to use a
      customizable style. (schultz)
    + Add: Add more timescale options to AccessLogValve and
      ExtendedAccessLogValve. Allow timescales to apply to "time-taken" token in
      ExtendedAccessLogValve. (schultz)
    + Fix: Fix WebDAV lock null (locks for non existing resources) thread safety
      and removal. (remm)
    + Fix: Add periodic checking for WebDAV locks expiration. (remm)
    + Fix: Extend Asn1Parser to parse UTF8Strings. (michaelo)
    + Fix: Remove MBean metadata for attibutes that have been removed. Based on
      pull request #719 by Shawn Q. (markt)
    + Update: Deprecate and remove sessionCounter (replaced by the addition of
      the active session count and the expired session count, as a reasonable
      approximation) and duplicates (which does not represent a possible event
      in current implementations) statistics from the session manager. (remm)
    + Fix: 68890 Align output encoding of JSPs in the Manager webapp with the
      XML declarations in those same files. (schultz)
    + Fix: Update Basic authentication to implement the requirements of RFC 7617
      including the changing of the trimCredentials setting which is now
      defaults to false. Note that the trimCredentials setting will be removed
      in Tomcat 11. (markt)
    + Fix: Change the thread-safety mechanism for protecting
      StandardServer.services from a simple synchronized lock to a
      ReentrantReadWriteLock to allow multiple readers to operate
      simultaneously. Based upon a suggestion by Markus Wolfe. (schultz)
    + Fix: Improve Service connectors, Container children and Service executors
      access sync using a ReentrantReadWriteLock. (remm)
    + Fix: Improve handling of integer overflow if an attempt is made to upload
      a file via the Servlet API and the file is larger than
      Integer.MAX_VALUE. (markt)
    + Fix: 68862: Handle possible response commit when processing read errors.  
      (remm)
  * Jasper
    + Fix: 68546: Small additional optimisation for initial loading of Servlet
      code generated for JSPs. Based on a suggestion by Dan Armstrong. (markt)
    + Add: Add support for specifying Java 23 (with the value 23) as the
      compiler source and/or compiler target for JSP compilation. If used with
      an Eclipse JDT compiler version that does not support these values, a
      warning will be logged and the default will used. (markt)
  * Web applications
    + Add: Add the ability to set a sub-title for the Manager web application
      main page. This is intended to allow users with lots of instances to
      easily distinguish them. Based on pull request #724 by Simon Arame.  
      (markt)
    + Fix: Examples: Improve performance of WebSocket chat application when
      multiple clients disconnect at the same time. (markt)
    + Update: Examples: Increase the number of previous messages displayed when
      using the WebSocket chat application. (markt)
    + Fix: Examples: Improve performance of WebSocket snake application when
      multiple clients disconnect at the same time. (markt)
  * Coyote
    + Fix: Fix OpenSSL FFM use of ERR_error_string with a 128 byte buffer, and
      use ERR_error_string_n instead. (remm)
    + Fix: Fix a crash on Windows setting CA certificate on null path. (remm)
    + Fix: 69068: Ensure read timouts are triggered for asynchronous,
      non-blocking reads when using HTTP/2. (markt)
    + Update: 69133: Add task queue size configuration on the Connector element,
      similar to the Executor element, for consistency. (remm)
    + Fix: Make counting of active HTTP/2 streams per connection more robust.  
      (markt)
    + Add: Add support for TLS 1.3 client initiated re-keying. (markt)
    + Fix: Improve the algorithm used to identify the IP address to use to
      unlock the acceptor thread when a Connector is listening on all local
      addresses. Interfaces that are configured for point to point connections
      or are not currently up are now skipped. (markt)
    + Fix: Align non-secure and secure writes with NIO and skip the write
      attempt when there are no bytes to be written. (markt)
    + Fix: Allow any positive value for socket.unlockTimeout. If a negative or
      zero value is configured, the default of 250ms will be used. (mark)
    + Fix: Reduce the time spent waiting for the connector to unlock. The
      previous default of 10s was noticeably too long for cases where the unlock
      has failed. The wait time is now 100ms plus twice socket.unlockTimeout.  
      (markt)
    + Fix: Ensure that the onAllDataRead() event is triggered when the request
      body uses chunked encoding and is read using non-blocking IO. (markt)
    + Fix: 68934: Add debug logging in the latch object when exceeding
      maxConnections. (remm)
    + Fix: Refactor trailer field handling to use a MimeHeaders instance to
      store trailer fields. (markt)
    + Fix: Ensure that multiple instances of the same trailer field are handled
      correctly. (markt)
    + Fix: Fix non-blocking reads of chunked request bodies. (markt)
    + Fix: When an invalid HTTP response header was dropped, an off-by-one error
      meant that the first header in the response was also dropped. Fix based on
      pull request #710 by foremans. (markt)
    + Fix: Fix bnd jar descriptor to include the OpenSSL FFM support. (remm)
    + Fix: Add OpenSSL FFM classes to tomcat-embed-core.jar. (remm)
    + Add: Add OpenSSL integration using the FFM API rather than Tomcat Native.
      OpenSSL support may be enabled by adding the
      org.apache.catalina.core.OpenSSLLifecycleListener listener on the Server
      element when using Java 22 or later. (remm)
  * WebSocket
    + Fix: 68884: Reduce the write timeout when writing WebSocket close messages
      for abnormal closes. The timeout defaults to 50 milliseconds and may be
      controlled using the
      org.apache.tomcat.websocket.ABNORMAL_SESSION_CLOSE_SEND_TIMEOUT property
      in the user properties collection associated with the WebSocket session.  
      (markt)
  * Other
    + Update: Revert Derby to 10.16.1.1 as that is the latest version of Derby
      that runs on Java 17. (markt)
    + Update: Update to Commons Daemon 1.4.0. (markt)
    + Update: Update to Objenesis 3.4. (markt)

    + Add: Improvements to Japanese translations by tak7iji. (markt)
    + Update: Switch to using the Base64 encoder and decoder provided by the JRE
      rather than the version provided by Commons Codec. The internal fork of
      Commons Codec has been deprecated and will be removed in Tomcat 11.  
      (markt)
    + Update: Update NSIS to 3.10. (mark0t)

Fri Apr  5 16:00:06 UTC 2024 - Michele Bussolotto <michele.bussolotto@suse.com>

- Update to Tomcat 10.1.20
  * Fixed CVEs:
    + CVE-2024-24549: Improved request header validation for HTTP/2 stream 
      (bsc#1221386)
    + CVE-2024-23672: Ensure that WebSocket connection closure completes if 
      the connection is closed when the server side has used the proprietary 
      suspend/resume feature to suspend the connection (bsc#1221385) 
  * Catalina
    + Fix:  Minor performance improvement for building filter chains. 
      Based on ideas from #702 by Luke Miao. (remm)
    + Fix:  Align error handling for Writer and OutputStream. Ensure 
      use of either once the response has been recycled triggers a 
      NullPointerException provided that discardFacades is configured with 
      the default value of true. (markt)
    + Fix:  68692: The standard thread pool implementations that are 
      configured using the Executor element now implement ExecutorService 
      for better support NIO2. (remm)
    + Fix:  68495: When restoring a saved POST request after a 
      successful FORM authentication, ensure that neither the URI, the 
      query string nor the protocol are corrupted when restoring the 
      request body. (markt)
    + Fix:  After forwarding a request, attempt to unwrap the 
      response in order to suspend it, instead of simply closing it if it 
      was wrapped. Add a new suspendWrappedResponseAfterForward boolean 
      attribute on Context to control the bahavior, defaulting to false. 
      (remm)
    + Fix:  68721: Workaround a possible cause of duplicate class 
      definitions when using ClassFileTransformers and the transformation 
      of a class also triggers the loading of the same class. (markt)
    + Fix:  The rewrite valve should not do a rewrite if the output 
      is identical to the input. (remm)
    + Update:  Add a new valveSkip (or VS) rule flag to the rewrite 
      valve to allow skipping over the next valve in the Catalina pipeline. 
      (remm)
    + Update:  Add highConcurrencyStatus attribute to the 
      SemaphoreValve to optionally allow the valve to return an error 
      status code to the client when a permit cannot be acquired from the 
      semaphore. (remm)
    + Add:  Add checking of the "age" of the running Tomcat instance 
      since its build-date to the SecurityListener, and log a warning if 
      the server is old. (schultz)
    + Fix:  When using the AsyncContext, throw an 
      IllegalStateException, rather than allowing an NullPointerException, 
      if an attempt is made to use the AsyncContext after it has been 
      recycled. (markt)
    + Fix:  Correct JPMS and OSGi meta-data for tomcat-embed-core.jar 
      by removing reference to org.apache.catalina.ssi package that is no 
      longer included in the JAR. Based on pull request #684 by Jendrik 
      Johannes. (markt)
    + Fix:  Fix ServiceBindingPropertySource so that trailing \r\n 
      sequences are correctly removed from files containing property values 
      when configured to do so. Bug identified by Coverity Scan. (markt)
    + Add:  Add improvements to the CSRF prevention filter including 
      the ability to skip adding nonces for resource name and subtree URL 
      patterns. (schultz)
    + Fix:  Review usage of debug logging and downgrade trace or data 
      dumping operations from debug level to trace. (remm)
    + Fix:  68089: Further improve the performance of request 
      attribute access for ApplicationHttpRequest and ApplicationRequest. 
      (markt)
    + Fix:  68559: Allow asynchronous error handling to write to the 
      response after an error during asynchronous processing. (markt)
  * Coyote
    + Fix:  Improve the HTTP/2 stream prioritisation process. If a 
      stream uses all of the connection windows and still has content to 
      write, it will now be added to the backlog immediately rather than 
      waiting until the write attempt for the remaining content. (markt)
    + Fix:  Add threadsMaxIdleTime attribute to the endpoint, to 
      allow configuring the amount of time before an internal executor will 
      scale back to the configured minSpareThreads size. (remm)
    + Fix:  Correct a regression in the support for user provided 
      SSLContext instances that broke the 
      org.apache.catalina.security.TLSCertificateReloadListener. (markt)
    + Fix:  Setting a null value for a cookie attribute should remove 
      the attribute. (markt)
    + Fix:  Make asynchronous error handling more robust. Ensure that 
      once a connection is marked to be closed, further asynchronous 
      processing cannot change that. (markt)
    + Fix:  Make asynchronous error handling more robust. Ensure that 
      once the call to AsyncListener.onError() has returned to the 
      container, only container threads can access the AsyncContext. This 
      protects against various race conditions that woudl otherwise occur 
      if application threads continued to access the AsyncContext.
    + Fix:  Review usage of debug logging and downgrade trace or data 
      dumping operations from debug level to trace. In particular, most of 
      the HTTP/2 debug logging has been changed to trace level. (remm)
    + Fix:  Add support for user provided SSLContext instances 
      configured on SSLHostConfigCertificate instances. Based on pull 
      request #673 provided by Hakan Altındağ. (markt)
    + Fix:  Partial fix for 68558: Cache the result of converting to 
      String for request URI, HTTP header names and the request 
      Content-Type value to improve performance by reducing repeated byte[] 
      to String conversions. (markt)
    + Fix:  Improve error reporting to HTTP/2 clients for header 
      processing errors by reporting problems at the end of the frame where 
      the error was detected rather than at the end of the headers. (markt)
    + Fix:  Remove the remaining reference to a stream once the 
      stream has been recycled. This makes the stream eligible for garbage 
      collection earlier and thereby improves scalability. (markt)
  * Jasper
    + Add:  Add support for specifying Java 22 (with the value 22) as 
      the compiler source and/or compiler target for JSP compilation. If 
      used with an Eclipse JDT compiler version that does not support these 
      values, a warning will be logged and the default will used. (markt)
    + Fix:  Handle the case where the JSP engine forwards a 
      request/response to a Servlet that uses an OutputStream rather than a 
      Writer. This was triggering an IllegalStateException on code paths 
      where there was a subsequent attempt to obtain a Writer. (markt)
    + Fix:  Correctly handle the case where a tag library is packaged 
      in a JAR file and the web application is deployed as a WAR file 
      rather than an unpacked directory. (markt)
    + Fix:  68546: Generate optimal size and types for JSP imports 
      maps, as suggested by John Engebretson. (remm)
    + Fix:  Review usage of debug logging and downgrade trace or data 
      dumping operations from debug level to trace. (remm)
  *	Cluster
    + Fix:  Avoid updating request count stats on async. (remm)
  * WebSocket
    + Fix:  Correct a regression in the fix for 66508 that could 
      cause an UpgradeProcessor leak in some circumstances. (markt)
    + Fix:  Review usage of debug logging and downgrade trace or data 
      dumping operations from debug level to trace. (remm)
    + Fix:  Ensure that WebSocket connection closure completes if the 
      connection is closed when the server side has used the proprietary 
      suspend/resume feature to suspend the connection. (markt)
  * Web applications
      Add:  Add support for responses in JSON format from the examples 
      application RequestHeaderExample. (schultz)
  * Other
    + Add:  Improvements to French translations. (remm)
    + Add:  Improvements to Japanese translations by tak7iji. (markt)
    + Fix:  57130: Allow digest.(sh|bat) to accept password from a 
      file or stdin. (csutherl/schultz)
    + Update:  Update Checkstyle to 10.14.1. (markt)
    + Fix:  Correct the remaining OSGi contract references in the 
      manifest files to refer to the Jakarta EE contract names rather than 
      the Java EE contract names. Based on pull request #685 provided by 
      Paul A. Nicolucci. (markt)
    + Update:  Update Checkstyle to 10.13.0. (markt)
    + Update:  Update JSign to 6.0. (markt)
    + Update:  Update the packaged version of the Tomcat Migration 
      Tool for Jakarta EE to 1.0.7. (markt)
    + Update:  Update Tomcat Native to 2.0.7. (markt)
    + Update:  Add strings for debug level messages. (remm)
    + Add:  Improvements to French translations. (remm)
    + Add:  Improvements to Japanese translations by tak7iji. (markt)

      the application swallows the exception. (markt)
  * Coyote
    + Fix:  Refactor the VirtualThreadExecutor so that it can be
      used by the NIO2 connector which was using platform threads
      even when configured to use virtual threads. (markt)
    + Fix:  Correct a regression in the fix for 67675 that broke
      TLS key file parsing for PKCS#8 format keys that do not specify

      This typically affects keys generated by OpenSSL 1.0.2.
      (markt)
    + Fix:  Allow multiple operations with the same name on
      introspected mbeans, fixing a regression caused by the
      introduction of a second addSslHostConfig method. (remm)
    + Fix:  Relax the check that the HTTP Host header is consistent
      with the host used in the request line, if any, to make the
      check case insensitive since host names are case insensitive.

    + Fix:  67666: Ensure TLS connectors using PEM files either
      work with the TLSCertificateReloadListener or, in the rare case
      that they do not, log a warning on Connector start. (markt)
    + Fix:  67675: Support a wider range of KDF and ciphers for PEM
      files than the combinations supported by the JVM by default.
      Specifically, support the OpenSSL default of HmacSHA256 and
      DES-EDE3-CBC. (markt)

  * Catalina
    + Add: 65770: Provide a lifecycle listener that will
      automatically reload TLS configurations a set time before the
      certificate is due to expire. This is intended to be used with
      third-party tools that regularly renew TLS certificates.
    + Fix: Fix handling of an error reading a context descriptor on

      actually being engaged.
    + Add: Improve handling of failures within recycle() methods.
  * Coyote
    + Fix: 67670: Fix regression with HTTP compression after code
      refactoring.
    + Fix: 67198: Ensure that the AJP connector attribute
      tomcatAuthorization takes precedence over the
      tomcatAuthentication attribute when processing an auth_type
      attribute received from a proxy server.
    + Fix: 67235: Fix a NullPointerException when an AsyncListener

    + Fix: When an error occurs during asynchronous processing,
      ensure that the error handling process is only triggered once
      per asynchronous cycle.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 21 16:41:56 UTC 2023 - Fridrich Strba <fstrba@suse.com>

- Update to Tomcat 9.0.80
  * Catalina
    + Add RateLimitFilter which can be used to mitigate DoS and
      Brute Force attacks
    + Move the management of the utility executor from the
      init()/destroy() methods of components to the start()/stop()
      methods.
    + Add org.apache.catalina.core.StandardVirtualThreadExecutor,
      a virtual thread based executor that may be used with one or
      more Connectors to process requests received by those
      Connectors using virtual threads. This Executor requires a
      minimum Java version of Java 21.
    + 66513: Add a per session Semaphore to the PersistentValve that
      ensures that, within a single Tomcat instance, there is no
      more than one concurrent request per session. Also expand the
      debug logging to include whether a request bypasses the Valve
      and the reason if a request fails to obtain the per session
      Semaphore.
    + 66609: Ensure that the default servlet correctly escapes file
      names in directory listings when using XML output.
    + 66618: Add a numeric last modified field to the XML directory
      listings produced by the default servlet to enable sorting in
      the XSLT.
    + 66621: Attempts to lock a collection with WebDAV may
      incorrectly fail if a child collection has an expired lock.
    + 66622: Deprecate the xssProtectionEnabled setting from the
      HttpHeaderSecurityFilter and change the default value to false
      as support for the associated HTTP header has been removed
      from all major browsers.
    + 59232: Add org.apache.catalina.core.ContextNamingInfoListener,
      a listener which creates context naming information
      environment entries.
    + 66665: Add
      org.apache.catalina.core.PropertiesRoleMappingListener, a
      listener which populates the context's role mapping from a
      properties file.
    + Fix an edge case where intra-web application symlinks would be
      followed if the web applications were deliberately crafted to
      allow it even when allowLinking was set to false.
    + Add utility config file resource lookup on Context to allow
      looking up resources from the webapp (prefixed with webapp:)
      and make the resource lookup API more visible.
    + Fix potential database connection leaks in
      DataSourceUserDatabase identified by Coverity Scan.
    + Make parsing of ExtendedAccessLogValve patterns more robust.
    + Fix failure trying to persist configuration for an internal
      credential handler.
    + 66680: When serializing a session during the session
      presistence process, do not log a warning that null Principals
      are not serializable.
    + Catch NamingException in JNDIRealm#getPrincipal. It is used in
      Java up to 17 to signal closed connections.
    + 66822: Use the same naming format in log messages for
      Connector instances as the associated ProtocolHandler instance.
    + The parts count should also lower the actual maxParameterCount
      used for parsing parameters if parts are parsed first.
    + If an application or library sets both a non-500 error code
      and the javax.servlet.error.exception request attribute, use
      the provided error code during error page processing rather
      than assuming an error code of 500.
    + Update code comments and Tomcat output to use MiB for
      1024 * 1024 bytes and KiB for 1024 bytes rather than
      MB and kB.
    + Avoid protocol relative redirects in FORM authentication
      (CVE-2023-41080, bsc#1214666).
  * Coyote
    + Update the HTTP/2 implementation to use the prioritization
      scheme defined in RFC 9218 rather than the one defined in
      RFC 7540.
    + 66602: not sending WINDOW_UPDATE when dataLength is ZERO on
      call SwallowedDataFramePayload.
    + 66627: Restore the documented behaviour of
      MessageBytes.getType() that it returns the type of the
      original content rather than reflecting the most recent
      conversion.
    + 66635: Correct certificate logging on start-up so it
      differentiates between keystore based keys/certificates and
      PEM file based keys/certificates and logs the relevant
      information for each.
    + Refactor blocking reads and writes for the NIO connector to
      remove code paths that could allow a notification from the
      Poller to be missed resuting in a timeout rather than the
      expected read or write.
    + Refactor waiting for an HTTP/2 stream or connection window
      update to handle spurious wake-ups during the wait.
    + Correct a regression introduced in 9.0.78 and use the correct
      constant when constructing the default value for the
      certificateKeystoreFile attribute of an
      SSLHostConfigCertificate instance.
    + Refactor HTTP/2 implementation to reduce pinning when using
      virtual threads.
    + Pass through ciphers referring to an OpenSSL profile, such as
      PROFILE=SYSTEM instead of producing an error trying to parse
      it.
    + 66841: Ensure that AsyncListener.onError() is called after an
      error during asynchronous processing with HTTP/2.
    + 66842: When using asynchronous I/O (the default for NIO and
      NIO2), include DATA frames when calculating the HTTP/2
      overhead count to ensure that connections are not prematurely
      terminated.
    + Correct a race condition that could cause spurious RST
      messages to be sent after the response had been written to an
      HTTP/2 stream.
  * WebSocket
    + 66548: Expand the validation of the value of the
      Sec-Websocket-Key header in the HTTP upgrade request that
      initiates a WebSocket connection. The value is not decoded but
      it is checked for the correct length and that only valid
      characters from the base64 alphabet are used.
    + Improve handling of error conditions for the WebSocket server,
      particularly during Tomcat shutdown.
    + Correct a regression in the fix for 66574 that meant the
      WebSocket session could return false for onOpen() before the
      onClose() event had been completed.
    + 66681: Fix a NullPointerException when flushing batched
      messages with compression enabled using permessage-deflate.
  * Web applications
    + Documentation. Expand the security guidance to cover the
      embedded use case and add notes on the uses made of the
      java.io.tmpdir system property.
    + 66662: Documentation. Fix a typo in the name of the algorithms
      attribute in the configuration section for the Digest
      authentication value.
    + Documentation. Update documentation to use MiB for
      1024 * 1024 bytes and KiB for 1024 bytes rather than
      MB and kB.
  * jdbc-pool
    + Fix the releaseIdleCounter does not increment when testAllIdle
      releases them.
    + Fix the ConnectionState state will be inconsistent with actual
      state on the connection when an exception occurs while
      writing.
  * Other
    + Update to Commons Daemon 1.3.4.
    + Improvements to French translations.
    + Update Checkstyle to 10.12.0.
    + Update the packaged version of the Apache Tomcat Native
      Library to 1.2.37 to pick up the Windows binaries built with
      with OpenSSL 1.1.1u.

      variable as intended on Windows when the path to the Java
      executable contains spaces.
    + Update Tomcat Native to 1.2.38 to pick up Windows binaries
