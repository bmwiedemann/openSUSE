# The strategy used is similar to e.g. OpenSSH:
# specify options with their default value where possible, 
# but leave them commented. Uncommented options change 
# a default value. Parenthesis state the command line option

# Port to listen on (-p)
#port=80

# www root directory (-d)
dir=/srv/www/htdocs

# The eternal question whether to chroot() or not to chroot()
# into "dir" above. If you don't want thttpd to chroot() change
# the next line to "nochroot" (-r|-nor)
#chroot

# data directory in the chroot dir
# as the default configuration just chroots into "dir"
# we leave this unset. Use it for running more complex webs with 
# thttpd (note, that at some point something more robust 
# (e.g. apache)might be a better choice). (-dd)
#data_dir=

# Instructs thttpd to check whether symlinked documents really 
# belong to the document tree. Disable with "nosymlinkcheck", 
# although this is not recommended (-s|-nos)
#symlinkcheck

# "El-cheapo" webhosting, enable with "vhost" (-v|-nov)
#novhost

# Use server-global .htpasswd file (see man page). Enable with 
# "globalpasswd" (-g|-nog)
#noglobalpasswd

# User to switch to after initialization when started as root
# (-u)
#user=wwwrun

# CGI scripts pattern (-c)

# File of throttle settings (-t) - see manpage

# Hostname to bind to for multihoming (-h)
#host=your.hostname.here

# Log-file; empty = use syslog(), /dev/null = without log. (-l)
