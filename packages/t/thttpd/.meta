  <title>Small and very simple webserver</title>
  <description>Thttpd is a very compact no-frills httpd serving daemon that can handle
very high loads.  While lacking many of the advanced features of Roxen
or Apache, thttpd operates without forking and is extremely efficient
in memory use.	Basic support for cgi scripts, authentication, and ssi
is provided for.  Advanced features include the ability to throttle
traffic.</description>
