  <title>A Clone of the Original Tetris Game</title>
  <description>  TINT is a clone of the original tetris game written by Alexey Pajitnov,
  Dmitry Pavlovsky, and Vadim Gerasimov.  The game is as close to the original
  as possible, but there are a few differences. Nevertheless, it's probably the
  closest to the original that you'll ever find in the UNIX world.
