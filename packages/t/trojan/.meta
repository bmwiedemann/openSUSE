  <title>An unidentifiable mechanism that helps you bypass internet censorship</title>
  <description>Trojan features multiple protocols over TLS to avoid both active/passive detections and ISP QoS limitations.

Trojan is not a fixed program or protocol. It's an idea, an idea that imitating the most common service, to an extent that it behaves identically, could help you get across the Great FireWall permanently, without being identified ever. We are the GreatER Fire; we ship Trojan Horses.</description>
