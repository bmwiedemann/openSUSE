%description
This package provides the alternatives made to transform a standard GRUB2
into a version that offers TCG (TPM) support for granting the integrity of the
boot process (trusted boot). This project was highly inspired by the former
projects TrustedGrub1 and GRUB-IMA. However TrustedGRUB2 was completely written
from scratch.
