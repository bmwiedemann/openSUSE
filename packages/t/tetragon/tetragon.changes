- Update to version 1.3.0:
  Large changelog, please find the full changelog here:
  https://github.com/cilium/tetragon/releases
  * Upgrade notes
    Depending on your setup, changes listed here might require a
    manual intervention.
    - Behavior of export-file-perm flag (and corresponding Helm
      value tetragon.exportFilePerm) changed. In case the export
      file exists, but has different permissions than specified in
      the option, Tetragon will change the file permissions on the
      next log rotation. In older versions, log rotation preserved
      permissions of the existing file. Before upgrading check if
      permissions of the existing export file match the option (600
      by default), and set the agent flag or Helm value to the
      desired value if needed.
    - Events (protobuf API)
      New events for syscall64 type
      Previous versions of Tetragon did not distinguish between
      different ABIs when using the syscall64 type because the
      output was just a size_arg with the id. When executing the
      getcpu syscall, for example, the JSON for 64- and 32-bits
      would be:
      "args":[{"size_arg":"309"}]
      "args":[{"size_arg":"318"}]
      Note that id 318 for x86_64 is a different syscall: getrandom
      so we cannot distinguish between a getrandom syscall on
      x86_64 and a getcpu call on 32-bit (i386). To address this
      issue, the output of syscall64 was changed to a SyscallId
      object that also includes the ABI. So the JSON for 64- and
      32-bits getcpu now is:
      "args":[{"syscall_id":{"id":309,"abi":"x64"}}]
      "args":[{"syscall_id":{"id":318,"abi":"i386"}}]
      Users that want to maintain the old behavior can use the
      --enable-compatibility-syscall64-size-type flag for this
      version.
      The flag will be removed in v1.4.
    - Metrics
      tetragon_ratelimit_dropped_total metric is renamed to
      tetragon_export_ratelimit_events_dropped_total
  * Major Changes:
    - IMA hashes in LSM events (#2818) by @anfedotoff
    - tetragon: add support for associating pod information when
      nested cgroups are used (#3170) by @kkourt
