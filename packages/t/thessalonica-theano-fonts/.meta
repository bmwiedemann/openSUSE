  <title>Theano Classical Fonts</title>
  <description>Theano Classical Fonts include three fonts listed below. Each font is
currently available just in one weight/shape (regular) and contains
Latin, Greek and Cyrillic letters.

Theano Didot.
A classicist face, with both its Roman and Greek parts implemented in
Didot style. Unlike Old Standard, this font is designed from French
sources.

Theano Modern.
A font with Greek letters designed in the Porsonic style. Unlike most
modern implementation, it is based on Figgins Pica No. 3 / Small Pica
No. 2 — probably the most successful and once the most popular Greek
face of a Porsonic origin — rather than on later Monotype's design.
The accompanying Latin font is implemented in the Modern style and
modelled after English Modern faces of later 19th century, often used
alonglide with Porsonic Greek types.

Theano Old Style.
A modernized &quot;Old Style&quot; Greek font with a large number of historic
ligatures and alternate forms, modelled after some early 19th century
types designed by Figgins' type foundry. It is accompanied by a Latin
face based on some &quot;Old Style&quot; Roman fonts of the late 19th and early
20th century.
