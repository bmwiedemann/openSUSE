%description
TimescaleDB is a database for making SQL more scalable for
time-series data. It is engineered up from PostgreSQL, providing
automatic partitioning across time and space (partitioning key), as
well as full SQL support.

TimescaleDB is packaged as a PostgreSQL extension.

This build includes only Apache2 modules;
TSL (timescale licenced modules are not built).
