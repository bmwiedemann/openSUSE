- Update to version 2.25.0
  This release contains performance improvements and bug fixes
  since the 2.24.0 release. We recommend that you upgrade at the
  next available opportunity.

  Highlighted features in TimescaleDB v2.25.0

  This release features multiple improvements for continuous
  aggregates on the columnstore:

  - Faster refreshes: You can now utilize direct compress during
    materialized view refreshes, resulting in higher throughput and
    reduced I/O usage.
  - Efficiency: The enablement of delete optimizations
    significantly lowers system resource requirements.
  - Smaller transactions: Adjusted defaults for buckets_per_batch
    to 10 reduces transaction sizes, requiring less WAL holding
    time.
  - Faster queries: Smarter defaults for segmentby and orderby
    yield improved query performance and better compression ratio
    on the columnstore.

  Sunsetting announcements

  - This release removes the WAL-based invalidation of continuous
    aggregates. This feature was introduced in 2.22.0 as tech
    preview to use logical decoding for building the invalidation
    logs. The feature was designed for high ingest workloads,
    reducing the write amplification. With the upcoming stream of
    improvements to continuous aggregates, this feature was
    deprioritized and removed.
  - The old continuous aggregate format, deprecated in version
    2.10.0, has been fully removed from TimescaleDB in this
    release. Users still on the old format should read the
    migration documentation to migrate to the new format. Users of
    Tiger Cloud have already been automatically migrated.

Wed Dec  3 11:19:23 UTC 2025 - Marcus Rueckert <mrueckert@suse.de>

- Update to version 2.24.0
  This release contains performance improvements and bug fixes
  since the 2.23.1 release. We recommend that you upgrade at the
  next available opportunity.

  Highlighted features in TimescaleDB v2.24.0
  - Direct Compress just got smarter and faster: it now works
    seamlessly with hypertables generating continuous aggregates.
    Invalidation ranges are computed directly in-memory based on
    the ingested batches and written efficiently at transaction
    commit. This change reduces the IO footprint drastically by
    removing the write amplification of the invalidation logs.
  - Continuous aggregates now speak UUIDv7: hypertables partitioned
    by UUIDv7 are fully supported through an enhanced time_bucket
    that accepts UUIDv7 values and returns precise, timezone-aware
    timestamps — unlocking powerful time-series analytics on modern
    UUID-driven table schemas.
  - Lightning-fast recompression: the new recompress := true option
    on the compress_chunk API enables pure in-memory recompression,
    delivering a 4–5× speed boost over the previous disk-based
    process.

  ARM support for bloom filters
  The sparse bloom filter indexes will stop working after upgrade
  to 2.24. If you are affected by this problem, the warning "bloom
  filter sparse indexes require action to re-enable" will appear in
  the Postgres log during upgrade.

  In versions before 2.24, the hashing scheme of the bloom filter
  sparse indexes used to depend on the build options of the
  TimescaleDB executables. These options are set by the package
  publishers and might differ between different package sources or
  even versions. After upgrading to a version with different
  options, the queries that use the bloom filter lookups could
  erroneously stop returning the rows that should in fact match the
  query conditions. The 2.24 release fixes this by using distinct
  column names for each hashing scheme.

  The bloom filter sparse indexes will be disabled on the
  compressed chunks created before upgrading to 2.24. To re-enable
  them, you have to decompress and then compress the affected
  chunks.

  If you were running the official APT package on AMD64
  architecture, the hashing scheme did not change, and it is safe
  to use the existing bloom filter sparse indexes. To enable this,
  set the GUC timescaledb.read_legacy_bloom1_v1 = on in the server
  configuration.

  The chunks compressed after upgrade to 2.24 will use the new
  index format, and the bloom filter sparse indexes will continue
  working as usual for these chunks without any intervention.

  For more details, refer to the pull request #8761.

  - Deprecations
    - The next release of TimescaleDB will remove the deprecated
      partial continuous aggregates format. The new format was
      introduced in 2.7.0 and provides significant improvements in
      terms of performance and storage efficiency. Please use
      cagg_migrate(<CONTINUOUS_AGGREGATE_NAME>) to migrate to the
      new format. Tiger Cloud users are migrated automatically.
    - In future releases the deprecated view
      timescaledb_information.compression_settings will be removed.
      Please use
      timescaledb_information.hypertable_columnstore_settings as a
      replacement.
    - The experimental view timescaledb_experimental.policies and
      the adjacent experimental functions add_policies,
      alter_policies, show_policies, remove_policies, and
      remove_all_policies to manage continuous aggregates will be
      removed in an upcoming release. For replacements, please use
      the Jobs API.
  - Backward-Incompatible Changes
    - #8761 Fix matching rows in queries using the bloom filter
      sparse indexes potentially not returned after extension
      upgrade. The version of the bloom filter sparse indexes is
      changed. The existing indexes will stop working and will
      require action to re-enable. See the section above for
      details.

Wed Oct 29 10:03:59 UTC 2025 - Marcus Rueckert <mrueckert@suse.de>

- Update to version 2.23.0
  This release contains performance improvements and bug fixes
  since the 2.22.1 release. We recommend that you upgrade at the
  next available opportunity.

  Highlighted features in TimescaleDB v2.23.0

  - This release introduces full PostgreSQL 18 support for all
    existing features. TimescaleDB v2.23 is available for
    PostgreSQL 15, 16, 17, and 18.
  - UUIDv7 compression is now enabled by default on the
    columnstore. This feature was shipped in v2.22.0. It saves you
    at least 30% of storage and delivers ~2× faster query
    performance with UUIDv7 columns in the filter conditions.
  - Added the ability to set hypertables to unlogged, addressing an
    open community request #836. This allows the tradeoff between
    durability and performance, with the latter being favourable
    for larger imports.
  - By allowing set-returning functions in continuous aggregates,
    this releases addresses a long standing blocker, raised by the
    community #1717.

  PostgreSQL 15 deprecation announcement

  - We will continue supporting PostgreSQL 15 until June 2026.
    Closer to that time, we will announce the specific TimescaleDB
    version in which PostgreSQL 15 support will not be included
    going forward.

  This release contains performance improvements and bug fixes
  since the 2.20.3 release. We recommend that you upgrade at the
  next available opportunity.

  Highlighted features in TimescaleDB v2.21.0

  - The attach & detach chunks feature allows manually adding or
    removing chunks from a hypertable with uncompressed chunks,
    similar to PostgreSQL’s partition management.
  - Continued improvement of backfilling into the columnstore,
    achieving up to 2.5x speedup for constrained tables, by
    introducing caching logic that boosts throughput for writes to
    compressed chunks, bringing INSERT performance close to that of
    uncompressed chunks.
  - Optimized DELETE operations on the columstore through
    batch-level deletions of non-segmentby keys in the filter
    condition, greatly improving performance to up to 42x faster in
    some cases, as well as reducing bloat, and lowering resource
    usage.
  - The heavy lock taken in Continuous Aggregate refresh was
    relaxed, enabling concurrent refreshes for non-overlapping
    ranges and eliminating the need for complex customer
    workarounds.
  - [tech preview] Direct Compress is an innovative TimescaleDB
    feature that improves high-volume data ingestion by compressing
    data in memory and writing it directly to disk, reducing I/O
    overhead, eliminating dependency on background compression
    jobs, and significantly boosting insert performance.

  Sunsetting of the hypercore access method

  We made the decision to deprecate hypercore access method (TAM)
  with the 2.21.0 release. It was an experiment, which did not show
  the signals we hoped for and will be sunsetted in TimescaleDB
  2.22.0, scheduled for September 2025. Upgrading to 2.22.0 and
  higher will be blocked if TAM is still in use. Since TAM’s
  inception in 2.18.0, we learned that btrees were not the right
  architecture. The recent advancements in the columnstore—such as
  more performant backfilling, SkipScan, adding check constraints,
  and faster point queries—put the columnstore close to or on par
  with TAM without the storage from the additional index. We
  apologize for the inconvenience this action potentially causes
  and are here to assist you during the migration process.

- Update to release 0.9.2 (2018-05-04)
  + High-level changes
    Fixed handling of DISCARD ALL command when parallel workers are
     involved, which sometimes caused the extension to complain it
     was not preloaded
    User permission bug fix where users locating TRIGGER permissions
    in a database could not insert data into a hypertable
   + Fixes for some issues with 32-bit architectures
- Changes for 0.9.1
  + High-level changes
    For this release only, you will need to restart the database
    before running ALTER EXTENSION
    Several edge cases regarding CTEs addressed
    Updated preloader with better error messaging and fixed edge case
    ABI compatibility with latest PostgreSQL to help catch any
    breaking changes
- Changes for 0.9.0
  + When updating your database, you should connect using
    psql with the -X flag to prevent any .psqlrc commands from
    accidentally triggering the load of a previous DB version.
  + High-level changes
    Support for multiple extension versions on different databases
    in the same PostgreSQL instance.
    This allows different databases to be updated independently
    and provides for smoother updates between versions. No
    more spurious errors in the log as the extension is being
    updated, and new versions no longer require a restart of
    the database.
  + Streamlined update process for smaller binary/package sizes
  + Significant refactoring to simplify and improve codebase,
    including improvements to error handling, security/permissions
  + Corrections to edge-case scenarios involving dropping schemas,
    hypertables, dimensions, and more
  + Correctness improvements through propagating reloptions from main
    table to chunk tables and blocking ONLY commands that try to alter
    hypertables (i.e., changes should be applied to chunks as well)
  + Addition of a migrate_data option to create_hypertable to allow
    non-empty tables to be turned into hypertables without separate
    creation & insertion steps. Note, this option may take a while
    if the original table has lots of data
  + Support for ALTER TABLE RENAME CONSTRAINT
  + Support for adjusting the number of partitions for a space dimension
  + Improvements to tablespace handling
