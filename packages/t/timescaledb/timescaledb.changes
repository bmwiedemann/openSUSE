Sat May  5 11:02:20 UTC 2018 - bruno@ioda-net.ch

- Update to release 0.9.2 (2018-05-04)
  + High-level changes
    Fixed handling of DISCARD ALL command when parallel workers are
     involved, which sometimes caused the extension to complain it
     was not preloaded
    User permission bug fix where users locating TRIGGER permissions
    in a database could not insert data into a hypertable
   + Fixes for some issues with 32-bit architectures
- Changes for 0.9.1
  + High-level changes
    For this release only, you will need to restart the database
    before running ALTER EXTENSION
    Several edge cases regarding CTEs addressed
    Updated preloader with better error messaging and fixed edge case
    ABI compatibility with latest PostgreSQL to help catch any
    breaking changes
- Changes for 0.9.0
  + When updating your database, you should connect using
    psql with the -X flag to prevent any .psqlrc commands from
    accidentally triggering the load of a previous DB version.
  + High-level changes
    Support for multiple extension versions on different databases
    in the same PostgreSQL instance.
    This allows different databases to be updated independently
    and provides for smoother updates between versions. No
    more spurious errors in the log as the extension is being
    updated, and new versions no longer require a restart of
    the database.
  + Streamlined update process for smaller binary/package sizes
  + Significant refactoring to simplify and improve codebase,
    including improvements to error handling, security/permissions
  + Corrections to edge-case scenarios involving dropping schemas,
    hypertables, dimensions, and more
  + Correctness improvements through propagating reloptions from main
    table to chunk tables and blocking ONLY commands that try to alter
    hypertables (i.e., changes should be applied to chunks as well)
  + Addition of a migrate_data option to create_hypertable to allow
    non-empty tables to be turned into hypertables without separate
    creation & insertion steps. Note, this option may take a while
    if the original table has lots of data
  + Support for ALTER TABLE RENAME CONSTRAINT
  + Support for adjusting the number of partitions for a space dimension
  + Improvements to tablespace handling
