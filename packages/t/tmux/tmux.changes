Sat Oct  5 07:38:40 UTC 2024 - Fredrik Lönnegren <fredrik.lonnegren@suse.com>

- tmux 3.5a:
  * Do not translate BSpace as Unicode with extended keys.
  * Fix so that keys with Shift are represented correctly with extended keys.
  * Revert to using /bin/sh for #() and run-shell and if-shell; the change to
    use default-shell only applies now to popups.
  * Fix grey colour without a number suffix in styles.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 30 07:32:52 UTC 2024 - Fredrik Lönnegren <fredrik.lonnegren@suse.com>

- tmux 3.5:
  * Revamp extended keys support to more closely match xterm and support mode 2
    as well as mode 1. This is a substantial change to key handling which
    changes tmux to always request mode 2 from parent terminal, changes to an
    unambiguous internal representation of keys, and adds an option
    (extended-keys-format) to control the format similar to the xterm(1)
    formatOtherKeys resource.
  * Clear an overlay (popup or menu) when command prompt is entered.
  * Add copy-mode -d flag to scroll a page down if in copy mode already
    (matching -e).
  * Display hyperlinks in copy mode and add copy_cursor_hyperlink format to get
    the hyperlink under the cursor.
  * Add a prefix timeout option.
  * Mouse move keys are not useful as key bindings because we do not turn them
    on unless the application requests them. Ignore them so they do not cause
    the prefix to be canceled
  * Add search_count and search_count_partial formats in copy mode.
  * Do not reset mouse pane if clicked on status line,
  * Add mirrored versions of the main-horizontal and main-vertical layouts
    where the main pane is bottom or right instead of top or left.
  * Allow REP to work with Unicode characters.
  * Fix size calculation of terminators for clipboard escape sequences.
  * Treat CRLF as LF in config files where it is easy to do so.
  * The Linux console has some bugs with bright colours, so add some
    workarounds for it.
  * If built with systemd, remove some environment variables it uses.
  * Adjust the logic when deleting last buffer to better preserve the
    selection: if selecting the element below the deleted one fails (because as
    the last one), select the one above it instead.
  * Add --enable-jemalloc to build with jemalloc memory allocator (since glibc
    malloc is so poor).
  * Add a way (refresh-client -r) for control mode clients to provide OSC 10
    and 11 responses to tmux so they can set the default foreground and
    background colours.
  * Add N to search backwards in tree modes.
  * Use default-shell for command prompt, #() and popups.
  * Revert part of a change intended to improve search performance by skipping
    parts of lines already searched, but which in fact skipped the ends of
    lines altogether.
  * Add a command-error hook when a command fails.
  * Add an option allow-set-title to forbid applications from changing the pane
    title.
  * Correct handling of mouse up events (don't ignore all but the last released
    button), and always process down event for double click.
  * Fix a crash if focusing a pane that is exiting.
  * Pick newest session (as documented) when looking for next session for
    detach-on-destroy.
  * Reduce default escape-time to 10 milliseconds.
  * Add display-menu -M to always turn mouse on in a menu.
  * Look for feature code 21 for DECSLRM and 28 for DECFRA in the device
    attributes and also accept level 1.
  * Fix crash if built with SIXEL and the SIXEL colour register is invalid;
    also remove SIXEL images before reflow.
  * Do not notify window-layout-changed if the window is about to be destroyed.
  * Do not consider a selection present if it is empty for the selection_active
    and selection_present format variables.
  * Fix split-window -p.

Fri Jul  8 06:52:13 UTC 2022 - llyyr <llyyr.public@gmail.com>

- update to 3.3a:
  * Do not crash when run-shell produces output from a config file.
  * Do not unintentionally turn off all mouse mode when button mode is also
    present.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jun  4 07:12:46 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 3.3:
  * Add an ACL list for users connecting to the tmux socket. Users may be
    forbidden from attaching, forced to attach read-only, or allowed to attach
    read-write. A new command, server-access, configures the list. File system
    permissions must still be configured manually.
  * Emit window-layout-changed on swap-pane.
  * Better error reporting when applying custom layouts.
  * Handle ANSI escape sequences in run-shell output.
  * Add pane_start_path to match start_command.
  * Set PWD so shells have a hint about the real path.
  * Do not allow pipe-pane on dead panes.
  * Do not report mouse positions (incorrectly) above the maximum of 223 in
    normal mouse mode.
  * Add an option (default off) to control the passthrough escape sequence.
  * Support more mouse buttons when the terminal sends them.
  * Add a window-resized hook which is fired when the window is actually resized
    which may be later than the client resize.
  * Add next_session_id format with the next session ID.
  * Add formats for client and server UID and user.
  * Add argument to refresh-client -l to forward clipboard to a pane.
  * Add remain-on-exit-format to set text shown when pane is dead.
  * With split-window -f use percentages of window size not pane size.
  * Add an option (fill-character) to set the character used for unused areas of
    a client.
  * Add an option (scroll-on-clear) to control if tmux scrolls into history on
    clear.
  * Add a capability for OSC 7 and use it similarly to how the title is set (and
    controlled by the same set-titles option).
  * Add support for systemd socket activation (where systemd creates the Unix
    domain socket for tmux rather than tmux creating it). Build with
    --enable-systemd.
  * Add an option (pane-border-indicators) to select how the active pane is shown
    on the pane border (colour, arrows or both).
  * Support underscore styles with capture-pane -e.
  * Make pane-border-format a pane option rather than window.
  * Respond to OSC 4 queries
  * Fix g/G keys in modes to do the same thing as copy mode (and vi).
  * Bump the time terminals have to respond to device attributes queries to three
    seconds.
  * If automatic-rename is off, allow the rename escape sequence to set an empty
    name.
  * Trim menu item text more intelligently.
  * Add cursor-style and cursor-colour options to set the default cursor style
    and colour.
  * Accept some useful and non-conflicting emacs keys in vi normal mode at the
    command prompt.
  * Add a format modifier (c) to force a colour to RGB.
  * Add -s and -S to display-popup to set styles, -b to set lines and -T to set
    popup title. New popup-border-lines, popup-border-style and popup-style
    options set the defaults.
  * Add -e flag to set an environment variable for a popup.
  * Make send-keys without arguments send the key it is bound to (if bound to a
    key).
  * Try to leave terminal cursor at the right position even when tmux is drawing
    its own cursor or selection (such as at the command prompt and in choose
    mode) for people using screen readers and similar which can make use of it.
  * Change so that {} is converted to tmux commands immediately when parsed. This
    means it must contain valid tmux commands. For commands which expand %% and
    %%%, this now only happens within string arguments. Use of nested aliases
    inside {} is now forbidden. Processing of commands given in quotes remains
    the same.
  * Disable evports on SunOS since they are broken.
  * Do not expand the file given with tmux -f so it can contain :s.
  * Bump FORMAT_LOOP_LIMIT and add a log message when hit.
  * Add a terminal feature for the mouse (since FreeBSD termcap does not have kmous).
  * Forbid empty session names.
  * Improve error reporting when the tmux /tmp directory cannot be created or
    used.
  * Give #() commands a one second grace period where the output is empty before
    telling the user they aren't doing anything ("not ready").
  * When building, pick default-terminal from the first of tmux-256color, tmux,
    screen-256color, screen that is available on the build system (--with-TERM
    can override).
  * Do not close popups on resize, instead adjust them to fit.
  * Add a client-active hook.
  * Make window-linked and window-unlinked window options.
  * Do not configure on macOS without the user making a choice about utf8proc
    (either --enable-utf8proc or --disable-utf8proc).
  * Do not freeze output in panes when a popup is open, let them continue to
    redraw.
  * Add pipe variants of the line copy commands.
  * Change copy-line and copy-end-of-line not to cancel and add -and-cancel
    variants, like the other copy commands.
  * Support the OSC palette-setting sequences in popups.
  * Add a pane-colours array option to specify the defaults palette.
  * Add support for Unicode zero-width joiner.
  * Make newline a style delimiter as well so they can cross multiple lines for
    readability in configuration files.
  * Change focus to be driven by events rather than scanning panes so the
    ordering of in and out is consistent.
  * Add display-popup -B to open a popup without a border.
  * Add a menu for popups that can be opened with button three outside the popup
    or on the left or top border. Resizing now only works on the right and bottom
    borders or when using Meta. The menu allows a popup to be closed, expanded to
    the full size of the client, centered in the client or changed into a pane.
  * Make command-prompt and confirm-before block by default (like run-shell). A
    new -b flags runs them in the background as before. Also set return code for
    confirm-before.
  * Change cursor style handling so tmux understands which sequences contain
    blinking and sets the flag appropriately, means that it works whether cnorm
    disables blinking or not. This now matches xterm's behaviour.
  * More accurate vi(1) word navigation in copy mode and on the status line. This
    changes the meaning of the word-separators option: setting it to the empty
    string is equivalent to the previous behavior.
  * Add -F for command-prompt and use it to fix "Rename" on the window menu.
  * Add different command histories for different types of prompts ("command",
    "search" etc).
- tmux-socket-path.patch: refresh
- build with utf8proc enabled
- set default TERM to recommended tmux-256colors

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jun 26 08:40:36 UTC 2021 - Andreas Stieger <andreas.stieger@gmx.de>

- update to 3.2a:
  * Add an "always" value for the "extended-keys" option; if set
    then tmux will forward extended keys to applications even if
    they do not request them.
  * Add a "mouse" terminal feature so tmux can enable the mouse on
    terminals where it is known to be supported even if
    terminfo(5) says otherwise.
  * Do not expand the filename given to -f so it can contain
    colons.
  * Fixes for problems with extended keys and modifiers, scroll
    region, source-file, crosscompiling, format modifiers and other
    minor issues.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat May  8 08:48:53 UTC 2021 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- refresh tmux-socket-path.patch: 
  restore ability to overwrite socket path using $TMUX_TMPDIR (bsc#1185572)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Apr 17 20:56:38 UTC 2021 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 3.2:
  * status-fg and status-bg are now applied before status-style rather than instead
    of; this means that if either is set to default the status-style colour will be
    used. To fix, replace status-bg default with status-style bg=default.
  * How data is sent to control mode clients has been completely revamped to both
    be more fair with multiple panes and to prevent huge amounts of data being
    backed up; this feature is used by default when tmux is attached with the
    latest iTerm2 nightly builds.
  * Configuration file parsing has changed slightly: the contents of the new {}
    syntax introduced in 3.1 must now be valid tmux command syntax; and to allow
    formats to be annotated, strings given with quotes may now contain newlines
    (leading spaces and comments are stripped).
  * A new customize mode available with C-b C (C-b S-c) which allows options and
    key bindings to be browsed and changed interactively.
  * Support for extended keys offered by some terminals (xterm, mintty, iTerm2),
    see https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki/Modifier-Keys#extended-keys.
  * A pane-border-lines option to change the characters used to draw the pane
    border separators.
  * How UTF-8 data is stored has been rewritten to reduce memory use for characters
    in the BMP.
  * The message log (C-b ~) has been changed to be per server instead of per client
    and to have some useful content.
  * Client flags have been extended (refresh-client -F becomes -f and also added
    for attach-session and new-session), and a read-only flag added (same as -r to
    attach-session).
  * A new active-pane client flag that if given allows a client to have its own
    active pane for each window rather than being tied to the server's active pane.
  * Improved command-prompt completion including showing a menu of completions.
  * All style options can now be formats, for example the default
    pane-active-border-style now changes colour depending on pane_in_mode and
    synchronize-panes.
  * Search match count has come back in copy mode, as well as performance
    improvements and additional styles for marking of search terms.
  * Try $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tmux/tmux.conf as well as ~/.config/tmux/tmux.conf.
  * Window and pane hooks such as window-layout-changed and pane-exited are now
    window or pane options instead of session options.
  * copy-pipe and friends can now be given with no arguments in which case they get
    the command from a new copy-command option. The default copy commands all now
    use copy-pipe. This makes it much easier to configure copy-pipe for all copy
    key bindings.
  * Terminal detection and feature code has been rewritten. tmux now collects sets
    of related terminfo(5) capabilties together with sensible default values into
    named "terminal features" which makes them easier to configure via a new
    terminal-features option or -T flag to tmux itself. tmux can detect and will
    automatically configure a number of common, modern terminal emulators.
  * Support for per-client overlay popups with a new display-popup command. A popup
    is also used for an e key binding in buffer mode to edit a buffer using the
    editor given in the new editor option (filled in from the EDITOR or VISUAL
    environment variables by default).
  * DoubleClick and TripleClick mouse key bindings have changed so that only one is
    fired. Behaviour similar to the old double-click key binding is now available
    as SecondClick. There are now default double- and triple-click bindings to copy
    a word or line, and a default middle-click binding to paste the top buffer.
  * When a server socket is given with -S, it is now created with umask 177 rather
    than 117.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov  9 10:35:03 UTC 2020 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Drop pkgconfig(systemd) BuildRequires: there is no reason to pull
  in systemd into the build.
- Use %tmpfiles_create instead of calling systemd-tmpfiles
  directly.
- Replace systemd_requires with systemd_ordering: tmux is very well
  capable to run without systemd (and by using tmpfiles_create, the
  post script can also cope with the absence of if).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 30 07:31:37 UTC 2020 - Andreas Stieger <andreas.stieger@gmx.de>

- tmux 3.1a:
  * Do not close stdout prematurely in control mode since it is
    needed to print exit messages. Prevents hanging when detaching
   with iTerm2
- includes changes between 3.1-rc1 and 3.1:
  * Only search the visible part of the history when marking
    (highlighting) search terms. This is much faster than searching
    the whole history and solves problems with large histories. The
    count of matches shown is now the visible matches rather than
    all matches
  * Search using regular expressions in copy mode. search-forward
    and search-backward use regular expressions by default; the
    incremental versions do not
  * Turn off mouse mode 1003 as well as the rest when exiting
  * Add selection_active format for when the selection is present
    but not moving with the cursor
  * Fix dragging with modifier keys, so binding keys such as
    C-MouseDrag1Pane and C-MouseDragEnd1Pane now work
  * Add -a to list-keys to also list keys without notes with -N
  * Do not jump to next word end if already on a word end when
    selecting a word; fixes select-word with single character words
    and vi(1) keys
  * Fix top and bottom pane calculation with pane border status
    enabled

  - Fix bugs in select-pane and the main-horizontal and main-vertical layouts.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun  4 06:49:49 UTC 2019 - Aleksa Sarai <asarai@suse.com>

- Add trailing newline to tmpfiles.d/tmux.conf. On newer systems (such as Leap
  15.1), the lack of a trailing newline appears to cause the directory to not
  be created.

  This is only evident on setups where /run is an actual tmpfs (on btrfs-root
  installs, /run is a btrfs subvolume and thus /run/tmux is persistent across
  reboots).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr 26 15:46:52 UTC 2019 - Ismail Dönmez <idonmez@suse.com>

- Update to version 2.9
  * Add format variables for the default formats in the various modes
    (tree_mode_format and so on) and add a -a flag to display-message
    to list variables with values.
  * Add a -v flag to display-message to show verbose messages as the
    format is parsed, this allows formats to be debugged
  * Add support for HPA (\033[`).
  * Add support for origin mode (\033[?6h).
  * No longer clear history on RIS.
  * Extend the #[] style syntax and use that together with previous
    format changes to allow the status line to be entirely configured
    with a single option.
  * Add E: and T: format modifiers to expand a format twice
    (useful to expand the value of an option).
  * The individual -fg, -bg and -attr options have been removed; they
    were superseded by -style options in tmux 1.9.
  * Add -b to display-panes like run-shell.
  * Handle UTF-8 in word-separators option.
  * New "terminal" colour allowing options to use the terminal default
    colour rather than inheriting the default from a parent option.
  * Do not move the cursor in copy mode when the mouse wheel is used.
  * Use the same working directory rules for jobs as new windows rather than
    always starting in the user's home.
  * Allow panes to be one line or column in size.
  * Go to last line when goto-line number is out of range in copy mode.
  * Yank previously cut text if any with C-y in the command prompt, only use the
    buffer if no text has been cut.
  * Add q: format modifier to quote shell special characters.
  * Add -Z to find-window.
  * Support for windows larger than the client. This adds two new options,
    window-size and default-size, and a new command, resize-window. The
    force-width and force-height options and the session_width and session_height
    formats have been removed.

- Update to 2.7
  * Remove EVENT_* variables from environment on platforms where
    tmux uses them so they do not pass on to panes.
  * Fixed for hooks at server exit.
  * Remove SGR 10 (was equivalent to SGR 0 but no other terminal
    seems to do this).
  * Expand formats in window and session names.
  * Add -Z flag to choose-tree, choose-client, choose-buffer to
    automatically zoom the pane when the mode is entered and unzoom
    when it exits, assuming the pane is not already zoomed. This is
    now part of the default key bindings.
  * Add C-g to exit modes with emacs keys.
  * Add exit-empty option to exit server if no sessions (default = on)
  * Show if a filter is present in choose modes.
  * Add pipe-pane -I to to connect stdin of the child process.
  * Performance improvements for reflow.
  * Use RGB terminfo(5) capability to detect RGB colour terminals
    (the existing Tc extension remains unchanged).
  * Support for ISO colon-separated SGR sequences.
  * Add select-layout -E to spread panes out evenly (bound to E key).
  * Support wide characters properly when reflowing.
  * Pass PWD to new panes as a hint to shells, as well as calling
    chdir().
  * Performance improvements for the various choose modes.
  * Only show first member of session groups in tree mode (-G flag
    to choose-tree to show all).
  * Support %else in config files to match %if
  * Fix "kind" terminfo(5) capability to be S-Down not S-Up.
  * Add a box around the preview label in tree mode.
  * Show exit status and time in the remain-on-exit pane text
  * Correctly use pane-base-index in tree mode.
  * Change the allow-rename option default to off.
  * Support for xterm(1) title stack escape sequences
  * Correctly remove padding cells to fix a UTF-8 display problem

- update to 2.6
* Add select-pane -T to set pane title.
* Fix memory leak when lines with BCE are removed from history.
* Fix (again) the "prefer unattached" behaviour of attach-session.
* Reorder how keys are checked to allow keys to be specified that have a
  leading escape. GitHub issue 1048.
* Support REP escape sequence (\033[b).
* Run alert hooks based on options rather than always, and allow further bells
  even if there is an existing bell.
* Add -d flag to display-panes to override display-panes-time.
* Add selection_present format when in copy mode (allows key bindings that do
  something different if there is a selection).
* Add pane_at_left, pane_at_right, pane_at_top and pane_at_bottom formats.
* Make bell, activity and silence alerting more consistent by: removing the
  bell-on-alert option; adding activity-action and silence-action options with
  the same possible values as the existing bell-action; adding a "both" value
  for the visual-bell, visual-activity and visual-silence options to trigger
  both a bell and a message.
* Add a pane_pipe format to show if pipe-pane is active.
* Block signals between forking and resetting signal handlers so that the
  libevent signal handler doesn't get called in the child and incorrectly write
  into the signal pipe that it still shares with the parent. GitHub issue 1001.
* Allow punctuation in pane_current_command.
* Add -c for respawn-pane and respawn-window.
* Wait for any remaining data to flush when a pane is closed while pipe-pane is
  in use.
* Fix working out current client with no target. GitHub issue 995.
* Try to fallback to C.UTF-8 as well as en_US.UTF-8 when looking for a UTF-8
  locale.
* Add user-keys option for user-defined key escape sequences (mapped to User0
  to User999 keys).
* Add pane-set-clipboard hook.
* FAQ file has moved out of repository to online.
* Fix problem with high CPU usage when a client dies unexpectedly. GitHub issue
  941.
* Do a dance on OS X 10.10 and above to return tmux to the user namespace,
  allowing access to the clipboard.
* Do not allow escape sequences which expect a specific terminator (APC, DSC,
  OSC) to wait for forever - use a small timeout. This reduces the chance of
  the pane locking up completely when sent garbage (cat /dev/random or
  similar).
* Support SIGUSR2 to toggle logging on a running server, also generate the
  "out" log file with -vv not -vvvv.
* Make set-clipboard a three state option: on (tmux both sends to outside
  terminal and accepts from applications inside); external (tmux sends outside
  but does not accept inside); and off.
* Fix OSC 4 palette setting for bright foreground colours. GitHub issue 954.
* Use setrgbf and setrgbb terminfo(5) capabilities to set RGB colours, if they
  are available. (Tc is still supported as well.)
* Fix redrawing panes when they are resized several times but end up with the
  size unchanged (for example, splitw/resizep -Z/breakp).
* Major rewrite of choose mode. Now includes preview, sorting, searching and
  tagging; commands that can be executed directly from the mode (for example,
  to delete one or more buffers); and filtering in tree mode.
* choose-window and choose-session are now aliases of choose-tree (in the
  command-alias option).
* Support OSC 10 and OSC 11 to set foreground and background colours.
* Check the U8 capability to determine whether to use UTF-8 line drawing
  characters for ACS.
* Some missing notifications for layout changes.
* Control mode clients now do not affect session sizes until they issue
  refresh-client -C. new-session -x and -y works with control clients even if
  the session is not detached.
* All new sessions that are unattached (whether with -d or started with no
  terminal) are now created with size 80 x 24. Whether the status line is on or
  off does not affect the size of new sessions until they are attached.
* Expand formats in option names and add -F flag to expand them in option values.
* Remember the search string for a pane even if copy mode is exited and entered
  again.
* Some further BCE fixes (scroll up, reverse index).
* Improvements to how terminals are cleared (entirely or partially).

- update to 2.4
- refresh tmux-socket-path.patch
  + Incompatible Changes
	* Key tables have undergone major changes. Mode key tables are no longer
	  separate from the main key tables. All mode key tables have been removed,
	  together with the -t flag to bind-key and unbind-key.
	  The emacs-edit, vi-edit, emacs-choose and vi-choose tables have been replaced
	  by fixed key bindings in the command prompt and choose modes. The mode-keys
	  and status-keys options remain.
	  The emacs-copy and vi-copy tables have been replaced by the copy-mode and
	  copy-mode-vi tables. Commands are sent using the -X and -N flags to
	  send-keys. So the following:
		bind -temacs-copy C-Up scroll-up
		bind -temacs-copy -R5 WheelUpPane scroll-up
	  Becomes:
		bind -Tcopy-mode C-Up send -X scroll-up
		bind -Tcopy-mode WheelUpPane send -N5 -X scroll-up
	  This changes allows the full command parser (including command sequences) and
	  command set to be used - for example, the normal command prompt with editing
	  and history is now used for searching, jumping, and so on instead of a custom
	  one. The default C-r binding is now:
		bind -Tcopy-mode C-r command-prompt -p'search up' "send -X search-backward '%%'"
	  There are also some new commmands available with send -X, such as
	  copy-pipe-and-cancel.
	* set-remain-on-exit has gone -- can be achieved with hooks instead.
	* Hooks: before hooks have been removed and only a selection of commands now
	  have after hooks (they are no longer automatic). Additional hooks have been
	  added.
	* The xterm-keys option now defaults to on.
 + Normal Changes
	* Support for mouse double and triple clicks.
	* BCE (Background Colour Erase) is now supported.
	* All occurrences of a search string in copy mode are now highlighted;
	  additionally, the number of search results is displayed. The highlighting
	  updates interactively with the default emacs key bindings (incremental
	  search).
	* source-file now understands glob patterns.
	* Formats now have simple comparisons:
		#{==:a,b}
		#{!=:a,b}
	* There are the following new formats:
	  - #{version} -- the tmux server version;
	  - #{client_termtype} -- the terminal type of the client;
	  - #{client_name} -- the name of a client;
	  - #{client_written} -- the number of bytes written to the client.
	* The configuration file now accepts %if/%endif conditional blocks which are
	  processed when it is parsed; the argument is a format string (useful with the
	  new format comparison options).
	* detach-client now has -E to execute a command replacing the client instead of
	  exiting.
	* Add support for custom command aliases, this is an array option which
	  contains items of the form "alias=command". This is consulted when an
	  unknown command is parsed.
	* break-pane now has -n to specify the new window name.
	* OSC 52 support has been added for programs inside tmux to set a tmux buffer.
	* The mouse "all event" mode (1003) is now supported.
	* Palette setting is now possible (OSC 4 and 104).
	* Strikethrough support (a recent terminfo is required).
	* Grouped sessions can now be named (new -t).
	* terminal-overrides and update-environment are now array options (the previous
	  set -ag syntax should work without change).
	* There have been substantial performance improvements.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep 30 12:29:29 UTC 2016 - aloisio@gmx.com

- Update to version 2.3
  * New option 'pane-border-status' to add text in the oane
    borders.
  * Support for hooks on commands: 'after' and 'before' hooks.
  * 'source-file' understands '-q' to supress errors for
    nonexistent files.
  * Lots of UTF8 improvements, especially on MacOS.
  * 'window-status-separator' understands #[] expansions.
  * 'split-window' understands '-f' for performing a full-width
    split.
  * Allow report count to be specified when using 'bind-key -R'.
  * 'set -a' for appending to user options (@foo) is now
    supported.
  * 'display-panes' can now accept a command to run, rather
    than always selecting the pane.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr 12 07:44:49 UTC 2016 - idonmez@suse.com

- Update to 2.2
 + Incompatible changes:
   * The format strings which referenced time have been removed.  Instead:
     #{t:window_activity} can be used.
   * Support for TMPDIR has been removed.  Use TMUX_TMPDIR instead.
   * UTF8 detection how happens automatically if the client supports it, hence
     the mouse-utf8, utf8 options has been removed.
   * The mouse_utf8_flag format string has been removed.
   * The -I option to show-messages has been removed.  See #{t:start_time}
     format option instead.
  + Other changes:
    * Panes are unzoomed with selectp -LRUD
    * New formats added:
      #{scroll_position}
      #{socket_path}
      #{=10:...} -- limit to N characters (from the start)
      #{=-10:...} -- limit to N characters (from the end)
      #{t:...} -- used to format time-based formats
      #{b:...} -- used to ascertain basename from string
      #{d:...} -- used to ascertain dirname from string
     #{s:...} -- used to perform substitutions on a string
    * Job output is run via the format system, so formats work again
    * If display-time is set to 0, then the indicators wait for a key to be
      pressed.
    * list-keys and list-commands can be run without starting the tmux server.
    * kill-session learns -C to clear all alerts in all windows of the session.
    * Support for hooks (internal for now), but hooks for the following have been
      implemented:
      alert-bell
      alert-silence
      alert-activity
      client-attached
      client-detached
      client-resized
      pane-died
      pane-exited
    * RGB (24bit) colour support.  The 'Tc' flag must be set in the external TERM
      entry (using terminal-overrides or a custom terminfo entry).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Oct 18 18:38:49 UTC 2015 - mimi.vx@gmail.com

- update to 2.1
- Incompatible Changes:
* Mouse-mode has been rewritten.  There's now no longer options for:
	- mouse-resize-pane
	- mouse-select-pane
	- mouse-select-window
	- mode-mouse
  Instead there is just one option:  'mouse' which turns on mouse support
  entirely.
* 'default-terminal' is now a session option.  Furthermore, if this is set
  to 'screen-*' then emulate what screen does.  If italics are wanted, this
  can be set to 'tmux' but this is still new and not necessarily supported
  on all platforms with older ncurses installs.
* The c0-* options for rate-limiting have been removed.  Instead, a backoff
  approach is used.
- Normal Changes:
* New formats:
	- session_activity
	- window_linked
	- window_activity_format
	- session_alerts
	- session_last_attached
	- client_pid
	- pid
* 'copy-selection', 'append-selection', 'start-named-buffer' now understand
  an '-x' flag to prevent it exiting copying mode.
* 'select-pane' now understands '-P' to set window/pane background colours.
* 'renumber-windows' now understands windows which are unlinked.
* 'bind' now understands multiple key tables.  Allows for key-chaining.
* 'select-layout' understands '-o' to undo the last layout change.
* The environment is updated when switching sessions as well as attaching.
* 'select-pane' now understands '-M' for marking a pane.  This marked pane
  can then be used with commands which understand src-pane specifiers
  automatically.
* If a session/window target is prefixed with '=' then only an exact match
  is considered.
* 'move-window' understands '-a'.
* 'update-environment' understands '-E' when attach-session is used on an
  already attached client.
* 'show-environment' understands '-s' to output Bourne-compatible commands.
* New option: 'history-file' to save/restore command prompt history.
* Copy mode is exited if the history is cleared whilst in copy-mode.
* 'copy-mode' learned '-e' to exit copy-mode when scrolling to end.

  since 1.9
- expand the make_install macro to make it work on distros without
  the macro
- expand tmpfiles_create macro as it isnt defined on sle12 e.g.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May  7 07:30:00 UTC 2015 - gber@opensuse.org

- update to version 2.0
  - Incompatible changes:
    - The choose-list command has been removed.
    - 'terminal-overrides' is now a server option, not a session
      option.
    - 'message-limit' is now a server option, not a session option.
    - 'monitor-content' option has been removed.
    - 'pane_start_path' option has been removed.
    - The "info" mechanism which used to (for some commands)
      provide feedback has been removed, and like other commands,
      they now produce nothing on success.
  - Normal changes:
    - tmux can now write an entry to utmp if the library 'utempter'
      is present at compile time.
    - set-buffer learned append mode (-a), and a corresponding
      'append-selection' command has been added to copy-mode.
    - choose-mode now has the following commands which can be
      bound:
        - start-of-list
        - end-of-list
        - top-line
        - bottom-line
    - choose-buffer now understands UTF-8.
    - Pane navigation has changed:
        - The old way of always using the top or left if the choice
          is ambiguous.
        - The new way of remembering the last used pane is annoying
          if the layout is balanced and the leftmost is obvious to
          the user (because clearly if we go right from the
          top-left in a tiled set of four we want to end up in
          top-right, even if we were last using the bottom-right).
          So instead, use a combination of both: if there is only
          one possible pane alongside the current pane, move to it,
          otherwise choose the most recently used of the choice.
    - 'set-buffer' can now be told to give names to buffers.
    - The 'new-session', 'new-window', 'split-window', and
      'respawn-pane' commands now understand multiple arguments and
      handle quoting problems correctly.
    - 'capture-pane' understands '-S-' to mean the start of the
      pane, and '-E-' to mean the end of the pane.
    - Support for function keys beyond F12 has changed.  The
      following explains:
        - F13-F24 are S-F1 to S-F12
        - F25-F36 are C-F1 to C-F12
        - F37-F48 are C-S-F1 to C-S-F12
        - F49-F60 are M-F1 to M-F12
        - F61-F63 are M-S-F1 to M-S-F3
      Therefore, F13 becomes a binding of S-F1, etc.
    - Support using pane id as part of session or window specifier
      (so % means session-of-%1 or window-of-%1) and window id as
      part of session
      (so @1 means session-of-@1).
    - 'copy-pipe' command now understands formats via -F
    - 'if-shell'  command now understands formats via -F
    - 'split-window' and 'join-window' understand -b to create the
      pane to the left or above the target pane.
- drop obsolete tmux-fix-malloc-check-abort.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov 14 17:56:33 UTC 2014 - crrodriguez@opensuse.org

- tmux-socket-path.patch: Just like screen, create socket
  directory with tmpfiles.d functionality in /run/tmux
  and not in /tmp. This patch only alters the default
  directory that can be still overrriden by setting
  TMUX_TMPDIR or TMPDIR environment variable. This add some
  robustness against accidental deletion via
  systemd-tmpfiles-clean, tmpwatch, or similar.

  - Fix -fg/-bg/-style with 256 colour terminals.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb 20 22:18:42 UTC 2014 - gber@opensuse.org

- update to version 1.9
  - NOTE: This release has bumped the tmux protocol version. It is
    therefore advised that the prior tmux server is restarted when
    this version of tmux is installed, to avoid protocol mismatch
    errors for newer clients trying to talk to an older running
    tmux server.
  - 88 colour support has been removed.
  - 'default-path' has been removed. The new-window command accepts
    '-c' to cater for this. The previous value of "." can be
    replaced with: 'neww -c $PWD', the previous value of '' which
    meant current path of the pane can be specified as: 'neww -c
    "#{pane_current_path}"'
  - The single format specifiers: #A -> #Z (where defined) have
    been deprecated and replaced with longer-named equivalents, as
    listed in the FORMATS section of the tmux manpage.
  - The various foo-{fg,bg,attr} commands have been deprecated and
    replaced with equivalent foo-style option instead. Currently
    this is still backwards-compatible, but will be removed over
    time.
  - A new environment variable TMUX_TMPDIR is now honoured,
    allowing the socket directory to be set outside of TMPDIR
    (/tmp/ if not set).
  - If -s not given to swap-pane the current pane is assumed.
  - A #{pane_syncronized} format specifier has been added to be a
    conditional format if a pane is in a syncronised mode (c.f.
    syncronize-panes)
  - Tmux now runs under Cygwin natively.
  - Formats can now be nested within each other and expanded
    accordingly.
  - Added 'automatic-rename-format' option to allow the automatic
    rename mechanism to use something other than the default of
    #{pane_current_command}.
  - new-session learnt '-c' to specify the starting directory for
    that session and all subsequent windows therein.
  - The session name is now shown in the message printed to the
    terminal when a session is detached.
  - Lots more format specifiers have been added.
  - Server race conditions have been fixed; in particular commands
    are not run until after the configuration file is read
    completely.
  - Case insensitive searching in tmux's copy-mode is now possible.
  - attach-session and switch-client learnt the '-t' option to
    accept a window and/or a pane to use.
  - Copy-mode is only exited if no selection is in progress.
  - Paste key in copy-mode is now possible to enter text from the
    clipboard.
  - status-interval set to '0' now works as intended.
  - tmux now supports 256 colours running under fbterm.
  - Many bug fixes!

    key-binding actions
  - choose-* commands now work outside of an attached client
  - aliases are now shown for list-commands command
  - status learns about formats
  - free-form options can be set with set-option if prepended with
    an '@' sign
  - capture-pane learnt '-p' to send to stdout, and '-e' for

    screen, and '-P' to dump pending output
  - many new formats added (client_session, client_last_session,
    etc.)
  - control mode, which is a way for a client to send tmux commands
    currently more useful to users of iterm2
  - resize-pane learnt '-x' and '-y' for absolute pane sizing
  - config file loading now reports errors from all files which are
    loaded via the 'source-file' command
  - 'copy-pipe' mode command to copy selection and pipe the
    selection to a command
  - changes panes can now emit focus notifications for certain
    applications which use those
  - run-shell and if-shell now accept format placeholders
  - resize-pane learnt '-Z' for zooming a pane temporarily
  - new-session learnt '-A' to make it behave like attach-session
  - set-option learnt '-o' to prevent setting an option which is
    already set

    "\" at the end of a line
  - new option status-position to move the status line to the top
    or bottom of the screen
  - enforce history-limit option when clearing the screen
  - Give each window a unique id, like panes but prefixed with @
  - add pane id to each pane in layout description (while still
    accepting the old form)
  - provide defined ways to set the various default-path
    possibilities: ~ for home directory, . for server start
    directory, - for session start directory and empty for the
    pane's working directory (the default). All can also be used as
    part of a relative path (eg -/foo). Also provide -c flags to
    neww and splitw to override default-path setting
  - add -l flag to send-keys to send input literally (without
    translating key names)
  - allow a single option to be specified to show-options to show
    just that option
  - new command "move-pane" (like join-pane but allows the same
    window)
  - join-pane and move-pane commands learn "-b" option to place the
    pane to the left or above
  - support for bracketed-paste mode
  - allow send-keys command to accept hex values
  - add locking around "start-server" to avoid race-conditions
  - break-pane learns -P/-F arguments for display formatting

    anything
  - copy mode learns "wrap-search" option
  - add a simple form of output rate limiting by counting the
    number of certain C0 sequences (linefeeds, backspaces, carriage
    returns) and if it exceeds a threshold (current default
    250/millisecond), start to redraw the pane every 100
    milliseconds instead of making each change as it comes. Two
    configuration options - c0-change-trigger and
    c0-change-interval
  - find-window learns new flags:  "-C", "-N", "-T" to match
    against either or all of a window's content, name, or title
    Defaults to all three options if none specified
  - find-window automatically selects the appropriate pane for the
    found matches
  - show-environment can now accept one option to show that
    environment value
  - exit mouse mode when end-of-screen reached when scrolling with
    the mouse wheel
  - select-layout learns -u and -U for layout history stacks
  - kill-window, detach-client, kill-session all  learn "-a" option
    for killing all but the current thing specified

Tue Jan 24 09:16:45 UTC 2012 - gber@opensuse.org

- update to version 1.6
  - extend the mode-mouse option to add a third choice which means
    the mouse does not enter copy mode
  - add a -r flag to switch-client to toggle the client read-only
    flag
  - add pane-base-index option
  - support \ for line continuation in the configuration file
  - framework for more powerful formatting of command output and
    use it for list-{panes,windows,sessions}; this allows more
    descriptive replacements (such as #{session_name}) and
    conditionals
  - mark dead panes with some text saying they are dead
  - reject $SHELL if it is not a full path
  - add -S option to refresh-client to redraw status line
  - add an else clause for if-shell

    client working directory, if any, then default-path or session
    working directory)

    corresponding terminfo code (E3) before locking
  - when in copy mode, make repeat count indicate buffer to
    replace, if used

  - change the way the working directory for new processes is
    discovered; if default-path isn't empty, it is used; otherwise,
    if a new window is created from the command-line, the working
    directory of the client is used; if not, platform specific code
    is used to retrieve the current working directory of the
    process in the active pane; if that fails, the directory where
    the session was created is used, instead
  - do not change the current pane if both
    mouse-select-{pane,window} are enabled
  - add \033[s and \033[u to save and restore cursor position
  - allow $HOME to be used as default-path
  - add CNL and CPL escape sequences
  - calculate last position correctly for UTF-8 wide characters
  - add an option allow-rename to disable the window rename escape
    sequence

    and activity) added; therefore, remove the superfluous options
    window-status-alert-{attr,bg,fg}
  - add a -R flag to send-keys to reset the terminal
  - add strings to allow the aixterm bright colours to be used when
    configuring colours
  - drop the ability to have a list of keys in the prefix in favour
    of two separate options, prefix and prefix2
  - flag -2 added to send-prefix to send the secondary prefix key
  - show pane size in top right of display panes mode
  - some memory leaks plugged
  - more command-prompt editing improvements
  - various manpage improvements
