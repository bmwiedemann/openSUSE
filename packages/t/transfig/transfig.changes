Mon Feb  6 11:23:24 UTC 2017 - werner@suse.de

- Fix now failing download source service, that is don't do this

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb  2 13:44:43 UTC 2017 - werner@suse.de

- Update to fig2dev version 3.2.6a (Patchlevel 6a (January 2017))
  NEW FEATURES:
    o Distribute transfig.pdf. No need to build it from the TeX sources.
    o Enable reproducible build for svg output.
    o Set the creator to fig2dev, not to the path by which fig2dev is
      invoked.
  BUGS FIXED:
    Ticket numbers refer to https://sourceforge.net/p/mcj/tickets/#.
    o The svg output now produces correct patterns and pie-wege arcs.
      Property names instead of style attributes are used. Hollow arrow
      heads are really hollow, not filled with white. In the PostScript
      output, this might also clip a bit of the filling underneath an arrow.
    o tikz output: Re-use \dimen \XFigu if it is already defined. Ticket #3.
    o tikz output: A pattern in an object with line width zero and the
      stroke color equal to the fill color would produce a white fill.
      The tikz output now does not try to be smart and puts a pattern, even
      if the result is equal to a solid fill. Ticket #1.
    o pict2e output: Standalone tex-files always include color.sty. #2.
    o pict2e output: A pattern with stroke color equal to fill color is
      rendered as a solid fill.
    o Compiles when gnu iconv and standard iconv are present.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep 23 12:04:22 UTC 2016 - werner@suse.de

- Update to fig2dev version 3.2.6 (the successor of transfig)
  o Add compile switch --enable-versioning and script update-version_m4,
    to create version string from source control system
  o tikz output: Support -G (grid) option. Make \XFigwidth and \XFigheight
    only scale coordinates, not line widths; Do not set unnecessarily
    \color{black} on text.
  From Roland Rosenfeld <roland@spinnaker.de>
  o Correct comment string in man page fig2ps2tex.1
  o Distribute autotest file lookup_X_color.at - only useful for hacko
  From Brian V. Smith:
  o Changed object defs from O_ to OBJ_ because O_TEXT conflicts
    with system typedef (debian 37_OBJ_typedef.patch)
  o Remove unused charset variables cs and ca from genibmgl.c
    (debian 38_unusedcharset.patch)
  o Build with make CFLAGS="-Werror -Wpedantic -Wformat -Wformat-security'
  o On lines with Round or Projecting cap style and arrowheads, the line
    endpoint stuck out beyond the arrowhead (this was fixed in
    xfig 3.2.5c, but not here until now; debian 41_arrowhead.patch)
  o Changed .ce (center lines) to .RS (right-justify) in fig2ps2tex man
    page file because of issues when generating HTML (From Eric Raymond)
    (debian 36_manpage_ce2RS.patch)
  o Quotes added to output file name for several formats in case there
    are blanks in the name (debian 39_gs_quote.patch)
  o For PDF output, changed -dColorImageFilter from /FlateEncode to
    /DCTEncode for lossy compression (smaller pdf files)
    (debian 40_ColorImageFilter.patch)
  o Update help for PDF options (debian 42_PDF_help.patch)
  From Roland Rosenfeld. Bug numers refer to https://bugs.debian.org/#.
  o Remove bashisms in fig2ps2tex script. Reported from
    Chris Lamb <chris@chris-lamb.co.uk>. Fixes debian bug 480615.
  o Include sys/stat.h in genps.c. Reported from Steven Chamberlain
    <steven@pyro.eu.org>. Debian bug 654767. (28_fix_chmod...patch)
  o Distribute the man page transig.1. (34_transfig.1.patch)
  o Do not report user information in ps files. Debian bug 316382
    (04_displaywho.patch)
  o Set locale to C. Debian bug 45378 (05_locale_patch).
  o Support pdftex in transfig (20_transfig_pdftex.patch). Reported by
    Jindrich Makovicka <makovick@gmail.com>.
  o Fix some typos (22_typos.patch, 35_manpage_typos.patch).
  o Honor environment variable SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH, for reproducible
    builds. Debian bug 819911. From Alexis Bienven√ºe <pado@passoire.fr>.
    (33_honour_SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH.patch).
  o Enable fonts >= 42 pt, needs \usepackage{type1cm}. Bug 343139,
    (09_maxfontsize.patch).
  o New pict2e and tikz output language, for use with TeX/LaTeX.
  o Compile with ./configure; make; make install.
    Optionally, use make check; make installcheck.
  o By default, transfig is not built.
  o Swap patterns in PostScript output, were upside down.
  o Silence most compiler warnings.
  o Update man-pages and help text.
  o Accurately position arrowheads, flush with line, in PostScript output.

  * missing #includes in MP driver
  * added !defined(__FreeBSD) to fig2dev.h def for sys_nerr and errno
    From Eric Scott

  * extraneous stroke:black in svg header removed along with stroke color
    for text, since the text fill color does the whole job
  * fig2dev produces more correctly structured PostScript.  Files get printed via

- Update to transfig version 3.2.5 (bug ##267840)
  * SVG driver adds color and pattern filling to arcs
    from Martin Kroeker
  * bug which made arrowheads too short fixed
  * SVG driver corrects the ugly arrowheads on stick arrows
    from Martin Kroeker
  * EMF driver would crash when fed stdin
    from Martin Kroeker
  * Unhandled case for linetypes in latex driver
  * CUPS didn't like the order of some of the Postscript header
    from Ian Dall
  * Updated SVG driver from Martin Kroeker was missing from alpha6
  * Another SVG update: Use a font-family list of "Times,Symbol" for symbol
    characters - the Times fontface does not contain all elements of the
    Symbol font on all platforms
  * Typo in font name (was cmit10, should be cmti10) in MetaPost driver
    This bug fix was omitted from alpha6
  * Added -dPDFSETTINGS=/prepress option to ghostscript when generating
    PDF output to improve quality of bitmap graphics
  * Fill patterns now use PostScript Level 2 built-in pattern commands
    for Postscript/EPS/PDF and bitmap output
    From Konstantin Shemyak
  * Updated SVG driver from Martin Kroeker
  * New -K option to size bounding box to whole figure when exporting
    only certain depths
    From Dirk Osswald
  * Typo in font name (was cmit10, should be cmti10) in MetaPost driver
  * When all texts were "special" (LaTeX coded) in a figure, ISO
    characters weren't encoded in straight PS and PDF output
  * Bug in radius for circles in SVG driver (dev/gensvg.c)
  * fig2dev.man was missing many papersize options
  * Double fclose() in bitmap driver
  * Raster picture support added to SVG driver. (In SVG, this translates
    to a link to the image file plus rotation/scaling information. 
    While 'conformant' SVG viewers need only support PNG and JPEG, there
    is no a filetype test, as there is no limit on supported formats
    in the standard, and e.g. Batik is able to display XBM and GIF in
    addition.  Added code for rounded boxes (polyline subtype 4).
    Added code for boxes, explicit support for polygons.  Added
    xml-space:preserve qualifier on texts to preserve whitespace. Rewrote
    fill pattern handling to generate patterns as needed - adding support
    for penwidth and color.  Corrected tiling of all shingle patterns and
    reversal of horizontal shingles.
    From Martin Kroeker
  * Better arrowheads in SVG driver.  Corrected font family selection.
    Corrected (and simplified) calculation of white-tinted fill colors
    (and removed the HSV/RGB conversion code).
    From Justus Piater
  * Typo in LATEX_AND_XFIG file. Text should be: 
    \convertMPtoPDF{foo.0}{1}{1}
    It was missing parameters {1}{1}
  * Depth filter option -D was parsing range (e.g. 40:80) incorrectly
    Fix from Justus Piater
  * C++ style comments "//" changed to "/* */" in genmp.c
  * Integer overflow in computing some spline steps
  * \pagestyle{empty} added for epic/eepic driver so it doesn't produce
    unnecessary page number when LaTeXing
  * Many SVG driver enhancements from Martin Kroeker
    (martin@ruby.chemie.uni-freiburg.de)
  * New features in EMF driver from ITOH Yasufumi:
      support for locale text (if iconv() is available),
      arc box, open arc, rotated ellipse, picture,
      dash-triple-dotted line style, and all fill patterns.
  * "cleandir" directive missing from doc/manual/Makefile
  * Added note about requiring dummy argument for -R option
  * SVG driver bug fixes: semicolon missing in CSS properties, multiline
    string problem, width, height and viewbox attributes now relative to
    figure bounds instead of pagesize. Fixes from Justus Piater.
  * Font info was put in the pstex file even when there were only special
    texts.
  * Global option "-Z maxdim" to scale figure so that largest dimension
    (width or height) is maxdim inches
  * Shapepar driver to generate shaped paragraphs for LaTeX (-L shape)
    from Christian Gollwitzer
  * I18N support postscript file installation moved to fig2dev/dev
    directory and installed with InstallNonExecFile (imake directive)
  * options -dAutoFilterColorImages=false and -dColorImageFilter=/FlateEncode
    added to ghostscript call when exporting to pdf to improve image
    quality during compression
  * "Epoch" added to rpm spec
  * New HP/GL2 driver from Glenn Burkhardt with paper size selection,
    offset, centering and orientation options
  * comments about BINDIR added to fig2dev/Imakefile and transfig/Imakefile
    so user can easily change installation directory of both programs
  * MKDIRHIER used in Imakefile for installing support files instead of mkdir
  * commands like \\small used instead of SetFigFont for thick and thin
    dots for LaTeX export
    From Bo Thilde
  * removed typedefs of uint, ushort and ulong from genemf.h because
    systems should already have those defined
  * SVG driver not mentioned in fig2dev.1 (.man)
  * shortened two fprintf calls in gensvg.c for HP-UX which can't handle
    long strings
  * If an imported picture path points to some directory which is not the
    current directory, and there exists a picture file of the same name in
    the current directory, and the correct file is not compressed, fig2dev
    would use the file in the current directory because it stripped off
    the path first.  This was fixed by looking for the uncompressed name
    first.
  * Color values should be divided by 255, not 256 to produce values from
    0 to 1.0 in LaTeX, Tk and PostScript drivers, and readpng and readpcx
    utilities
  * Increased precision of arc angles from %.1f to %.4f in PS/EPS/PDF
    driver
  * Postscript support files now installed with r/w permissions only (was
    r/w/x)
  * Metapost (mp) driver now generates all Fig styles of arrowheads
    From Tim Braun
  * Bug in pic preamble - default font size either 0 or garbage
  * PDF not rotated anymore for landscape mode (similar to eps)
  * fontmag not set when magnification was read from Fig file
  * When there were only LaTeX special texts without backslashes (\) and
    no other objects in the figure, a bounding box of 0 width was produced
    for EPS, PS and PSTEX output.
  * Added ZLIBDIR variable in fig2dev/Imakefile to specify zlib directory
    if different from standard location
  * pstex_t export lacked border option (-b) to align LaTeX text when
    pstex figure specified border (also fixed in xfig Combined PS/LaTeX)
  * warnings in gentpic.c caused failure of gcc on hppa architecture under
    Debian
  * cleaned up lots of implicit declarations of functions/procs
  * transfig: the "psfig" language was missing from the list of languages,
    making things go out of sync past "ps".
  * transfig: "transfig -L pstex" was generating rules for ps not eps
  * slight margin added to text bounds
  * an incorrect printf specification (%d instead of %ld) in gemp.c
  * "#include <varargs.h>" no longer needed (and is unsupported by gcc 3.3)
  * Not a bug, really but a workaround for programs that generate Fig files
    with arcs that have coincident start and end points with the intent
    of making a circle (TCM apparently does this).  Without this
    workaround, such arcs have the same start and end angle, which
    ghostcript and probably other PostScript interpreters take to mean
    "don't draw anything".  This fix adds 0.01 degrees to the end angle
    if it is identical to the start angle.
  * Exporting a file with a picture containing a path with blanks failed
  * Incorrect ISO translation was: 
        "\\.S", /* latin capital letter S with dot above */
    Should be:
        "\\.Z", /* latin capital letter Z with dot above */
  * LaTeX: Correction to the ISO-8859-2 ogonek diacritic mark now uses \k
    instead of cedilla (\c).  If the macro \k isn't defined in your
    situation or you don't see the ogonek then define the macro: \def\k#1{\c{#1}}
    before the \begin{document}.  
    From Jerzy Sobczyk
  * Bug in user-defined colors when exporting to CGM. If color numbers
    weren't contiguous, e.g. 32, 34, then it couldn't find color 34.
  * glyphs in the Symbol font that have descenders weren't taken into
    account when calculating text bounds
  * missing blue and extra brown color in LaTeX driver
  * \smash directive added back to text objects in eepic driver (was removed 
    in 3.2.4)
  * Quotes in FIG2DEV_LIBDIR definition (fig2dev/Imakefile) interferred when
    using $DESTDIR
  * Comments not inserted in EMF output anymore (not valid in language)
  * float/int mixup in printf in pic driver for font size caused default
    font size to be 0
  * bug in hp/gl (ibmgl) driver produced incorrect JCL code to enter HP/GL
    mode when using -k option
  * point size factor changed from 72.27 to 72 points per inch as specified
    by HP tech notes
  * change in 3.2.4 which included all "special" (LaTeX) texts in the
    bounding box that don't have any backslashes ("\") in them failed to

    texts are also excluded from the bounding box calculation.
  * various man page format errors fixed
