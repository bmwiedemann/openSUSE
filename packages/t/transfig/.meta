  <description>TransFig is a set of tools for creating TeX documents with graphics
that are portable in the sense that they can be printed in a wide
variety of environments.

The transfig directory contains the source for the transfig command
which generates a Makefile which translates Fig code to various
graphics description languages using the fig2dev program.  In previous
releases, this command was implemented as a shell script.
