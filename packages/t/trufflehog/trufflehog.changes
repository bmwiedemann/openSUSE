-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 30 13:46:56 UTC 2023 - Jeff Kowalczyk <jkowalczyk@suse.com>

- Packaging improvements:
  * _service change disabled to manual per osc deprecation warning:
    WARNING: Command 'disabledrun/dr' is obsolete, please convert
    your _service to use 'manual' and then 'manualrun/mr' instead.
  * _service reorder move set_version earlier so go_modules sees
    updated version
  * Summary and Description clarify the purpose of this CLI tool
  * Use %%name macro where applicable to normalize common lines
    across Go app packages. Also makes renaming binary easier when
    required to handle package name conflict.
  * Drop BuildRequires: libpcre1. libpcre2 is already included
    during build, and there is no mention in upstream source or
    docs that only libpcre1 is supported. Since upstream uses
    CGO_ENABLED=0 in their Makefile, it is not clear if or how
    libpcre would be a required dependency.
  * Drop BuildRequires: golang-packaging. The original macros for
    file movements into GOPATH are obsolete with Go modules. Macro
    go_nostrip is no longer needed with current binutils and Go.
  * Remove %%{go_nostrip} macro which is no longer recommended
  * Extract go build command from upstream Makefile. The go build
    command straightforward in this package. Calling go build
    directly from packaging where possible helps package
    maintainers review usage and normalize packaging standards.
    Makefiles often have targets for building container images,
    running tests, etc. Makefiles can include assumptions of online
    access that do not hold for the OBS build environment.
  * Build PIE with pattern that may become recommended procedure:
    %%ifnarch ppc64 GOFLAGS="-buildmode=pie" %%endif go build
    A go toolchain buildmode default config would be preferable
    but none exist at this time.
  * Drop mod=vendor, go1.14+ will detect vendor dir and auto-enable
  * Drop export CGO_ENABLED="0" used by Makefile. Use the default
    unless there is a defined requirement or benefit.
