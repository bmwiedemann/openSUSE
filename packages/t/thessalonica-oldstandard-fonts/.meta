  <title>Old Standard Font Family</title>
  <description>Old Standard was intended as a multilingual font family suitable for
biblical, classical and medieval studies as well as for general-purpose
typesetting in languages which use Greek or Cyrillic script. The font is
currently available in three shapes: regular, italic and bold. Old
Standard is still far from being finished, and yet it already covers
a wide range of Latin, Greek and Cyrillic characters. It also supports
early Cyrillic letters and signs (including those added in Unicode 5.1)
and thus can be used for texts containing fragments in Old Slavonic and
Church Slavonic languages.
