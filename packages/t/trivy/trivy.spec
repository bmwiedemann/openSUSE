%description
Trivy (`tri` pronounced like trigger, `vy` pronounced like envy) is a simple and
comprehensive vulnerability scanner for containers and other artifacts. A
software vulnerability is a glitch, flaw, or weakness present in the software or
in an Operating System. Trivy detects vulnerabilities of OS packages (Alpine,
RHEL, CentOS, etc.) and application dependencies (Bundler, Composer, npm, yarn,
etc.). Trivy is easy to use. Just install the binary and you're ready to
scan. All you need to do for scanning is to specify a target such as an image
name of the container.
