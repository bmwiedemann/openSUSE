Thu Oct  3 20:53:02 UTC 2024 - Michael Pujos <pujos.michael@gmail.com>

- Update to 1.7.0 27.09.2024
  * Features
    Battery Care:
    - Apple Silicon Macbooks (M*) with MacOS 13.0 (or later) firmware and
      Asahi Linux kernel 6.6 (or later): start and stop threshold
    - MSI laptops supported by the msi_ec driver in kernel 6.3 (or later):
      start and stop threshold (Issue #707)
    - Lenovo laptops (non-ThinkPad series): tlp-stat -b: number 60% removed
      because the threshold varies by model (Issue #717)
    - LG Gram laptops: forward to lg-legacy for kernel <= 5.17 only
    - ThinkPads:
      - The obsolete tpacpi-bat driver along with the acpi_call dependency
        were removed. Current Linux distributions ship with kernel 5.17 or
        later, which enables battery care via the built-in thinkpad_acpi.
      - tlp-stat -b improvements for coreboot:
        - Fix charge readings (Issue #657)
        - Indicate when recalibration is not possible
    - tlp-stat -b: Highlight battery care status
    - tlp setcharge, tlp-stat -b: display a recommendation to use the laptop
      on battery power until the battery is discharged to the stop threshold
    Disks:
    - tlp-stat -d: replace disk serial number with asterisks (for privacy)
    General:
    - TLP_MSG_COLORS: highlight error, warning, notice and success messages
      in color.
    - Add option --version to all TLP commands

      -m|--mode: print current power mode
      -q|--quiet: omit version header and show less information in the
        processor category
    - Add Fish shell command completion
    - Improve busybox compatibility by using only portable options for flock
    Graphics:
    - AMDGPU_ABM_LEVEL_ON_AC/BAT: configure display panel power savings via
      Adaptive Backlight Modulation (ABM) from AMD Vega or newer GPUs;
      kernel 6.9 required
    Processor:
    - CPU_ENERGY_PERF_POLICY_ON_AC/BAT: drop backwards compatibility for
      EPB with kernels < 5.2; x86_energy_perf_policy is no longer required
    - CPU_HWP_DYN_BOOST_ON_AC/BAT: drop the AMD implementation; the
      corresponding kernel patch was discarded during the 2022 review,
      reincarnation seems unlikely
    - tlp-stat -t:
      - Show AMD CPU temperatures
      - Indicate unavailable fan speed
    - tlp-stat -p: identify CPU model on ARM systems
    Radio Devices:

        as coreboot does not support discharge/recalibrate anyway.
      - Fix Edge 11 battery enumeration (Issue #714)
      - Support ThinkPad W510
    Disks:
    - Ensure power saving for all USB disks when plugged in
    - tlp diskid: filter duplicates
    General:
    - tlp-stat -s: rework manual mode detection (Issue #702)
    - tlp-stat --psup/udev: fix udev rule check
    Radio Devices:
    - Avoid error popups from NetworkManager when switching wifi/wwan
    USB:
    - tlp-stat -u: filter out error messages
    - Prevent USB devices from being unrecognized or malfunctioning on battery;
      adds xhci_hcd to RUNTIME_PM_DRIVER_DENYLIST defaults (Issues #436, #587)

- Fix SourceURL (misplaced space) for Factory submission

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 18 16:15:17 UTC 2022 - Stefan Schubert <schubi@suse.de>

  /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d to vendor specific directory
  /usr/lib/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d. So, users changes can
  still be done in /etc and will not be overwritten by an update.

Fri Apr 18 13:35:05 UTC 2022 - popov895@ukr.net

- Due to conflicts with rfkill, we need to additionally mask the systemd-rfkill.socket
- Update to 1.5.0 07.01.2022
- * Features
    Battery:
      - Sony laptops: stop threshold 50/80/100% aka "battery care limiter"
      - ThinkPads:

        (Issue #589)
    Disks:
      - tlp-stat -d: display correct sysfs path for disk runtime pm:
        /sys/block/<DISK>/device/power/control (Issue #606)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec 28 10:04:15 UTC 2021 - lars@linux-schulserver.de - 1.4.0

- package bash completions for tlp-rdw in the corresponding 
  sub-package (bsc#1180496)
- add tlp-rpmlintrc to mark some rpmlint warnings as known good
- Fix bsc#1181279, bsc#1179635, bsc#1177313 - Failed to preset 
  unit: Unit file tlp-sleep.service does not exist. 
- As tlp somehow conflicts with rfkill and power-profiles-daemon 
  running at the same time, lets mask these services, when tlp is 
  installed. ...and obviously unmask them again on uninstall.
- Require at least NetworkManager >= 1.20 
- define _udev(,rules)dir, if not already set (for Leap)
- Pre-Require systemd (and BuildRequire systemd-rpm-macros) for 
  completeness
- tlp is not activated per default (bsc#1183235), as it may conflict
  with other Laptop mode tools. At the moment, users have to manually
  activate the service via 'sudo systemctl enable --now tlp.service'

        operating characteristics around power/performance levels, thermal
        and fan speed
      - tlp-stat -p: show state of ThinkPad lapmode
    Processor:
      - CPU_HWP_DYN_BOOST_ON_AC/BAT: Intel CPU HWP dynamic boost (Issue #468)
      - Remove backwards compatibility of CPU_ENERGY_PERF_POLICY_ON_AC/BAT with
