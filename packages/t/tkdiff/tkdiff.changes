Mon Nov 14 07:58:38 UTC 2022  - hsk17@mail.de

- for release info see also https://sourceforge.net/p/tkdiff/news/
- Update to 5.6
  * Repairs a significant display failure of the optional merge-preview
    window not properly responding to jump-scroll requests. While not a
    crash, it would continually report TK errors (AND not scroll)!
  * Additionally, it is now possible to request an entire directory
    TREE of files (of the current SCM sandbox) against a designated (or
    defaulted) revision.
- Update to 5.5.3
  * A quick-fix release to repair a syntax-typo CRASH involving the
    OPTIONALLY configured "-P file" commandline parameter.
  * Additionally, revised a prior (V5.5.2) change which attempted to
    repair mishandled VPATH Revision specifications originally created in
    V5.5. ALL variants of this code, until now, had been incorrect in one
    or more aspects.
- Update to 5.5.2
  * A quick-fix release to repair the inquiry mode of designated
    SCMs to self identify the set of files currently recognized as
    modified. Missing/lost initializations were causing spurious "unknown
    variable" crashes to occur.
- Update to 5.5.1
  * A quick-fix release to address minor oversights in the (now
    formalized) preference conversion logic that attempts to utilize an
    older Prefs-File in the CURRENT release. Sadly, these oversights CAN
    cause a script syntax CRASH - warranting this point release.
- Update to 5.5
  * CRITICAL logic repair to 'blanks' suppression support for INLINE hilite!
  * Revised coding to fix random (Mac observed) race-condition bug
    w/combobox mis-creation.
  * Repaired preference 'change' detection, resulting in a simplification
    and better rigor.
  * Popup menu now disables "Edit" (file) when POP occurs over DiffMap
    (not a L/R window).
  * Popup menu 'Find Nearest' when over DiffMap SCALES its search position
    based on POP location.
  * Added status display of how many merge choices are presently targetted
    as pure Left or Right
  * Internal: Preference evolution of older settings now tied to explicit
    versioning data
  * Created a "Engine config" Prefs tab - allows access to other Diff
    engines having ?better? algorithms
    - Also codifies what we need/expect FROM that underlying engine and
      HOW it is accessed.
    - Still permits ad-hoc specifications AND cmdline pass-thru.
    - Former diffcmd Pref now DERIVES from engine settings (remains for
      reference purposes)
    - Former ignoreblanks Pref (on/off) renamed and refers to multiple
      (indiv.) engine settings
    - Primary engine options (suppressions) specifically delineated AND
      configurable
    - Options shared among Diff and DiffSrch if command(s) 1st word matches,
      else distinct.
    - Visual feedback of IMPLIED Diff execution PRIOR to invocation
      (user notification).
  * Diff outputs NOT in "Normal" form, are now re-Evaluated for "Unified"
    format before giving up
  * Added warning HILITE to Preference actions that result in FORCING a
    new Diff invocation.
  * Internal: Dbg messaging CAN suspend arg-EVAL until KNOWN they are needed
    (lighter weight).
  * Handful of spelling typos, internal naming and code consolidations,
    as always- updated Help.

Mon May 30 14:02:46 UTC 2022 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Do not use %() constructs in Version and URL: these are used by
  bots in unprotected environments and are thus not evaluated.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun May 22 11:32:33 UTC 2022 - Ferdinand Thiessen <rpm@fthiessen.de>

- Update to version 5.4
  * Visual Inline-diff SUPPRESSION categories (correlates to those
    of Diff) supported, yet specific choices are INDEPENDANT of said
    same Diff MATCH suppressions
  * Optional support for MULTIPLE Preference files w/command-line
    specification added: permits user configuration for disjoint
    projects w/alternate SCM requirements
  * Reengineered optional SyncScroll to no longer permit fractured
    alignment - FOREVER: only specific features needing to
    TEMPORARILY override the Preference will do so.
  * New preference allows specifying filename patterns to EXCLUDE from
    searches among directories when forming canidate pairings for examination.
  * Text searching now (optionally) scrolls EITHER/BOTH windows
    independent of the current overall synchronized window preference
    setting.
  * Within Vpath SCM context, CWD location now effectively TOP-prunes
    stated VPATH nodes allowing access to yet older V-nodes w/o
    editting VPATH Subdirs WITHIN given Vpath nodes now recognized as
    legitimate CWD-scoped locations permitting operations on
    directory-based subdivisions while STILL being Vpath-ed
  * Repaired how Vpath searches for Topmost and/or Prior version for
    consistent results
  * MouseWheel now scrolls properly when above checkbuttons WITHIN
    the filelist Dialog

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb  8 12:50:23 UTC 2022  - hsk17@mail.de

- for release info see also https://sourceforge.net/p/tkdiff/news/
- Update to 5.3
  * Now treats a VPATH environment variable similarly to an SCM allowing
    comparison between adjacent topmost versions.
  * Repaired a syntax crash of Directory-based filename generation
  * Silenced a new recurrence of "TCL-sensitive" characters contained
    within input filenames being mis-interpretted
  * Filelist dialog now responds fully to threshold modifications it
    previously had waited until the next interaction occurred.
  * Added missing Wheel scrolling to the filelist dialog
  * Ensure XWindow "Class" of secondary window(s) REMAIN constant, some
    window managers were changing from "Tkdiff" to "Toplevel"
  * Usage of the Perforce SCM had been inadvertently disabled (a no
    longer internal reference had escaped being renamed)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct 17 14:42:23 UTC 2021  - hsk17@mail.de

- for release info see also https://sourceforge.net/p/tkdiff/news/
- Update to 5.2.1
  * Now provides an alternate means of displaying the list of file
    pairs (in a free standing dialog) when the number of files exceeds
    a user adjustable (1-25) maximum for using a simple menu choice.
  * Repaired what filenames are returned by a 'recursive' Diff search
    when the "-q" option is removed. Will now suppress binary files as
    originally intended (fault was caused by Tcl itself - not TkDiff).
  * Fixed initial display of toolbar buttons at startup. Was displaying
    BOTH text and icon versions (overlaid) until after a preference
    "Apply" had occurred.
- Update to 5.2
  * Permits recursive scanning of entire directory TREEs for candidate
    files. Uses Diff itself to perform the search by passing the needed
    options, which then become a new preference setting (to allow for
    alternative Diff engine usage)
  * Now shades the BOUNDARY LINE during "Split"-push manipulations:
    provides clearer feedback; edge is now perceived to exist immediately
    BETWEEN the shaded line and the line directly above it
  * Reduced 'interactive startup' reliance on a message console and now
    promotes a "retry" paradigm, rather than aborting, by presenting the
    interactive command dialog after issuing MOST startup failure messages
  * Fixed broken "Find Nearest Diff" (via the popup menu) to now use the
    user chosen popup LOCATION as the point for measuring "Nearest"
  * Repaired derivation of the INITIAL temp-dir path preference for NEW
    WINDOWS users that was broken by previous release.
  * Resolved minor clipping issue in toolbar combobox (re: fonts)
  * Avoid Diff crash caused by specifying MULTIPLE unique "ignore blanks"
    preference options
  * Avoid crash from malformed filename utilizing tilde-expansion to a
    non-existant user
  * Repaired missing Key Accelerator+Tip for File->Recompute menu item
  * Toolbar buttons now reset fully when a valid Diff execution happens
    to yeild ZERO results
  * Visible Focus-tabbing restored to dir/file browser buttons in the
    NewDiff dialog to facilitate keyboard navigation
- Update to 5.1
  * Complete overhaul of keyboard bindings provides user selection
    adds a 4th preferences editing tab for personalization of same
  * Expanded Bookmark facility including scrollability of items when
    toolbar capacity is exceeded. Bookmarks may be individually
    annotated and form the basis of a new item specific report format
  * Additional report format and ability to view complexity statistics
    without needing to generate an actual report
  * Internal reengineering of Read-Only text display implementation
    has restored keyboard-centric operation throughout the tool
  * Network latency support is now restored to the MacOS platform
  * General fault-tolerance throughout the tool has been increased
    with greater use of onscreen messaging instead of aborting.
  * Monochrome support has been discontinued (most features unusable).
  * Specific Ticket resolutions addressed:
    - (73) Crash caused from inadvertent mispelling of command
    - (74) Crash from scrolling prior to first hunk w/autoselect = on.
      Further, autoselect now operates passively when actively
      scrolling (will no longer trigger autocenter if active)
    - (75) a syntactic repair to prevent a Crash when chosing either
      of the L/R or R/L merge choices
  * Other anomalies resolved:
    - Repaired a data-dependant corner case which could either Crash or
      result in incomplete highlighting of 3way Diff ancestral markers
    - Resizing the main window smaller now operates properly; had been
      only allowing approximately 40% reduction.
    - Minor fix (toolwide) prevents wrong subwindows from squeezing shut
      prematurely during resizing to a smaller size.
    - Auxilliary windows (dialogs) now generally retain their prior
      positions when re-appearing after the user has moved them.
    - Tooltip windows on MacOS will never again display UNDER others.
  * Specific internal infrastructure modifications have produced a
    considerable level of uniformity and reliability throughout.
  * Special case workaround (re: multiple display monitors)
    Operations involving screen-edge clipping avoidance are presently
    flawed under TK. Until a better solution can be found, edge
    avoidance for windows appearing on secondary displays will be to
    their main window and not the screen edge. This generally affects
    Tooltips and combobox dropdown lists.
  * As always, builtin Help is updated to cover ALL change aspects
    it is recommended to read at least the process for bind editting
- Update to 5.0
  * New-Diff Dialog can now request Conflict file comparisons
    - It also permits choosing a preferred SCM system from among those
      detected, and is now ALWAYS the defaulted first operation when
      NO command line arguments are given - UNLESS one specific user
      preference has PREVIOUSLY been set which requests that the SCM
      inquire for currently uncommitted changes and supply those as
      parameters instead (not all SCMs can do this). For those that do,
      that search request may ALSO be accessed for the current session
      via the Dialog, even when such preference has been set to Off.
  * CVS (like Git and Subversion) is now capable of automatic inquiry
  * ALL SCMs capable of inquiry also pass CONFLICTED files when found
  * URLs (Svn style) are now accepted as FileSpecs in Dialog or Cmd use.
    - Including both versioned and defaulted styles, and as an Ancestor.
  * Multiple SCM involvement is now possible.
  * Merging when using an Ancestor file (ie. a 3-way diff) now provides
    Ancestral markers for deletion activities, similar to those
    already provided for additions, which also participate in both
    automatic merge selection choices AND collision detection, all in
    support of assuring that COMPLETE changes from both files being
    merged are accounted for.
  * Upgraded Conflictfile parsing to accept diff3-style file content
    providing the ability to treat it as in a 3-way Diff mode.
  * Interactive diff-region suppression (ie. ignoring) is now possible
  * Eliminated a TK-update race condition that was randomly responsible
    for odd crashes and potentially inconsistent screen updates
  * Minor feature enhancements:
     - Window manager is now provided a graphic to represent TkDiff
     - Displayed file NAMES now try to be shorter by truncating the CWD
     - Failed (or inconsistent) Diff executions are no longer fatal
     - 3-way Diffs using a non-unique Ancestor now simply drops 3-way mode
  * Small repairs involving: line numbering; Mac tooltip rendering;
    several hilighting anomolies involving suppressed Diff regions;
    and missing bindings when positioned over various Text-adjacent
    Info windows involving scroll operations. Lastly, filenames with
    sensitive characters (Dollar, square-Bracket) in their names
    will no longer crash, and the default setting for Filebrowser
    view-content filters is now specified properly.
  * And the builtin Help is updated to cover aspects of ALL the changes
