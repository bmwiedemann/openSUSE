- for release info see also https://sourceforge.net/p/tkdiff/news/
- Update to 5.2.1
  * Now provides an alternate means of displaying the list of file
    pairs (in a free standing dialog) when the number of files exceeds
    a user adjustable (1-25) maximum for using a simple menu choice.
  * Repaired what filenames are returned by a 'recursive' Diff search
    when the "-q" option is removed. Will now suppress binary files as
    originally intended (fault was caused by Tcl itself - not TkDiff).
  * Fixed initial display of toolbar buttons at startup. Was displaying
    BOTH text and icon versions (overlaid) until after a preference
    "Apply" had occurred.
- Update to 5.2
  * Permits recursive scanning of entire directory TREEs for candidate
    files. Uses Diff itself to perform the search by passing the needed
    options, which then become a new preference setting (to allow for
    alternative Diff engine usage)
  * Now shades the BOUNDARY LINE during "Split"-push manipulations:
    provides clearer feedback; edge is now perceived to exist immediately
    BETWEEN the shaded line and the line directly above it
  * Reduced 'interactive startup' reliance on a message console and now
    promotes a "retry" paradigm, rather than aborting, by presenting the
    interactive command dialog after issuing MOST startup failure messages
  * Fixed broken "Find Nearest Diff" (via the popup menu) to now use the
    user chosen popup LOCATION as the point for measuring "Nearest"
  * Repaired derivation of the INITIAL temp-dir path preference for NEW
    WINDOWS users that was broken by previous release.
  * Resolved minor clipping issue in toolbar combobox (re: fonts)
  * Avoid Diff crash caused by specifying MULTIPLE unique "ignore blanks"
    preference options
  * Avoid crash from malformed filename utilizing tilde-expansion to a
    non-existant user
  * Repaired missing Key Accelerator+Tip for File->Recompute menu item
  * Toolbar buttons now reset fully when a valid Diff execution happens
    to yeild ZERO results
  * Visible Focus-tabbing restored to dir/file browser buttons in the
    NewDiff dialog to facilitate keyboard navigation
- Update to 5.1
  * Complete overhaul of keyboard bindings provides user selection
    adds a 4th preferences editing tab for personalization of same
  * Expanded Bookmark facility including scrollability of items when
    toolbar capacity is exceeded. Bookmarks may be individually
    annotated and form the basis of a new item specific report format
  * Additional report format and ability to view complexity statistics
    without needing to generate an actual report
  * Internal reengineering of Read-Only text display implementation
    has restored keyboard-centric operation throughout the tool
  * Network latency support is now restored to the MacOS platform
  * General fault-tolerance throughout the tool has been increased
    with greater use of onscreen messaging instead of aborting.
  * Monochrome support has been discontinued (most features unusable).
  * Specific Ticket resolutions addressed:
    - (73) Crash caused from inadvertent mispelling of command
    - (74) Crash from scrolling prior to first hunk w/autoselect = on.
      Further, autoselect now operates passively when actively
      scrolling (will no longer trigger autocenter if active)
    - (75) a syntactic repair to prevent a Crash when chosing either
      of the L/R or R/L merge choices
  * Other anomalies resolved:
    - Repaired a data-dependant corner case which could either Crash or
      result in incomplete highlighting of 3way Diff ancestral markers
    - Resizing the main window smaller now operates properly; had been
      only allowing approximately 40% reduction.
    - Minor fix (toolwide) prevents wrong subwindows from squeezing shut
      prematurely during resizing to a smaller size.
    - Auxilliary windows (dialogs) now generally retain their prior
      positions when re-appearing after the user has moved them.
    - Tooltip windows on MacOS will never again display UNDER others.
  * Specific internal infrastructure modifications have produced a
    considerable level of uniformity and reliability throughout.
  * Special case workaround (re: multiple display monitors)
    Operations involving screen-edge clipping avoidance are presently
    flawed under TK. Until a better solution can be found, edge
    avoidance for windows appearing on secondary displays will be to
    their main window and not the screen edge. This generally affects
    Tooltips and combobox dropdown lists.
  * As always, builtin Help is updated to cover ALL change aspects
    it is recommended to read at least the process for bind editting
- Update to 5.0
  * New-Diff Dialog can now request Conflict file comparisons
    - It also permits choosing a preferred SCM system from among those
      detected, and is now ALWAYS the defaulted first operation when
      NO command line arguments are given - UNLESS one specific user
      preference has PREVIOUSLY been set which requests that the SCM
      inquire for currently uncommitted changes and supply those as
      parameters instead (not all SCMs can do this). For those that do,
      that search request may ALSO be accessed for the current session
      via the Dialog, even when such preference has been set to Off.
  * CVS (like Git and Subversion) is now capable of automatic inquiry
  * ALL SCMs capable of inquiry also pass CONFLICTED files when found
  * URLs (Svn style) are now accepted as FileSpecs in Dialog or Cmd use.
    - Including both versioned and defaulted styles, and as an Ancestor.
  * Multiple SCM involvement is now possible.
  * Merging when using an Ancestor file (ie. a 3-way diff) now provides
    Ancestral markers for deletion activities, similar to those
    already provided for additions, which also participate in both
    automatic merge selection choices AND collision detection, all in
    support of assuring that COMPLETE changes from both files being
    merged are accounted for.
  * Upgraded Conflictfile parsing to accept diff3-style file content
    providing the ability to treat it as in a 3-way Diff mode.
  * Interactive diff-region suppression (ie. ignoring) is now possible
  * Eliminated a TK-update race condition that was randomly responsible
    for odd crashes and potentially inconsistent screen updates
  * Minor feature enhancements:
     - Window manager is now provided a graphic to represent TkDiff
     - Displayed file NAMES now try to be shorter by truncating the CWD
     - Failed (or inconsistent) Diff executions are no longer fatal
     - 3-way Diffs using a non-unique Ancestor now simply drops 3-way mode
  * Small repairs involving: line numbering; Mac tooltip rendering;
    several hilighting anomolies involving suppressed Diff regions;
    and missing bindings when positioned over various Text-adjacent
    Info windows involving scroll operations. Lastly, filenames with
    sensitive characters (Dollar, square-Bracket) in their names
    will no longer crash, and the default setting for Filebrowser
    view-content filters is now specified properly.
  * And the builtin Help is updated to cover aspects of ALL the changes
