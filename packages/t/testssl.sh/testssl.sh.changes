- fix bash path for Leap 15.x

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 23 20:42:34 UTC 2020 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 3.0
  * Full support of TLS 1.3, shows also drafts supported
  * Extended protocol downgrade checks
  * ROBOT check
  * Better TLS extension support
  * Better OpenSSL 1.1.1 and higher versions support as well as
    LibreSSL >3
  * DNS over Proxy and other proxy improvements
  * Decoding of unencrypted BIG IP cookies
  * Initial client certificate support
  * Warning of 825 day limit for certificates issued after
    2018/3/1
  * Socket timeouts (--connect-timeout)
  * IDN/IDN2 servername/URI + emoji support, supposed
    libidn/idn2 is installed and DNS resolver is recent)support
  * Initial support for certificate compression
  * Better JSON output: renamed IDs and findings shorter/better
    parsable, also includes certficate
  * JSON output now valid also for non-responding servers
  * Testing now per default 370 ciphers
  * Further improving the robustness of TLS sockets (sending
    and parsing)
  * Support of supplying timeout value for openssl connect
    -- useful for batch/mass scanning
  * File input for serial or parallel mass testing can be also in
    nmap grep(p)able (-oG) format
  * LOGJAM: now checking also for DH and FFDHE groups (TLS 1.2)
  * PFS: Display of elliptical curves supported, DH and FFDHE
    groups (TLS 1.2 + TLS 1.3)
  * Check for session resumption (Ticket, ID)
  * TLS Robustness check GREASE and more
  * Server preference distinguishes between TLS 1.3 and lower
    protocols
  * Mark TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 as deprecated
  * Does a few startup checks which make later tests easier and
    faster (determine_optimal_\*())
  * Expect-CT header detection
  * --phone-out does certificate revocation checks via OCSP
    (LDAP+HTTP) and with CRL
  * --phone-out checks whether the private key has been
    compromised via https://pwnedkeys.com/
  * Missing SAN warning
  * Added support for private CAs
  * Way better handling of connectivity problems (counting those,
    if threshold exceeded -> bye)
  * Fixed TCP fragmentation
  * Added --ids-friendly switch
  * Exit codes better: 0 for running without error, 1+n for small
    errors, >240 for major errors.
  * Better error msg suppression (not fully installed OpenSSL)
  * Better parsing of HTTP headers & better output of longer HTTP
    headers
  * Display more HTTP security headers
  * HTTP Basic Auth support for HTTP header
  * experimental "eTLS" detection
  * Dockerfile and repo @ docker hub with that file (see above)
  * Java Root CA store added
  * Better support for XMPP via STARTTLS & faster
  * Certificate check for to-name in stream of XMPP
  * Support for NNTP and LMTP via STARTTLS, fixes for MySQL and
    PostgresQL
  * Support for SNI and STARTTLS
  * More robustness for any STARTTLS protocol (fall back to
    plaintext while in TLS caused problems)
  * Renegotiation checks improved, also no false potive for Node.js
    anymore
  * Major update of client simulations with self-collected
    up-to-date data
  * Update of CA certificate stores
  * Lots of bug fixes
  * More travis/CI checks -- still place for improvements
  * Bigger man page review
- specfile cleanup
- Add testssl.sh.rpmlintrc

  * pwnedkeys.com support
  * Initial support for certificate compression
  * Initial client certificate support
  * Better indentation for HTTP header outputs
  * Better parsing of HTTP headers
  * Penalize absence of TLS 1.2 anymore if server supports TLS 1.3 only
  * Several improvements related to protocol determination and downgrade responses
  * Some logic related using TLS 1.3 aware OpenSSL binaries more or less automagically
  * Internal improvements to server preference checks
  * Lots of internal and some speed improvements in "pre-flight checks" (comes before outputting any test)
  * Mark TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 as deprecated
  * Support newer OpenSSL/LibreSSL versions
  * Improved detection of wrong user input when file was supplied for --csv,--json and --html
