%description
tcpflow is a program that captures data transmitted as part of TCP connections
(flows), and stores the data in a way that is convenient for protocol
analysis and debugging. Each TCP flow is stored in its own file. Thus, the
typical TCP flow will be stored in two files, one for each direction.
tcpflow can also process stored 'tcpdump' packet flows.
