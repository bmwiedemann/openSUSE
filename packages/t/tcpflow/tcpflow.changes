- Update to version 1.6.1:
 - Here is release v1.6.1. Does not use the new be13 API that is updated for C++17. That's coming.

- No changelog for version 1.6.0 available.
- Update to version 1.5.2:
 - fixed sizeof(addr1) and sizeof(addr2) error in un_pair
- Update to version 1.5.1:

- license update: GPL-3.0+
  Source code files state that they are ^GPL^ licensed and to refer back to
  the ^LICENSE^ file for details. There is no ^LICENSE^ file but there is a

Upgrade to v1.3.0
	- converted code from c to c++
	* various fixes and additional features
	* src/tcpip.cpp (tcpip::close_file): added support for FUTIMENS, but I don't yet have a system on which to test it. Hope that it's good.
	* src/main.cpp (main): -r option now allows for multiple files to be specified.
	* src/main.cpp (main): -R option now allows for incomplete tcp connections to be finished.
	* src/tcpip.cpp (tcpdemux::tcpdemux): default outdir is now "."
	* src/xml.cpp (xml::add_cpuid): better handling of CPUID instruction. Now it really should not show up on non-Intel architectures.
	* src/main.cpp (main): added printing stats for debug level 3.
	* src/tcpip.cpp (tcpdemux::close_all): Jeremey's FD ring has been replaced with an unordere dset.
	* COPYING: updated to GPLv3
	* src/flow.cpp (flow::filename): completely rewrote to support templates.
	(flow::print_usage): added to give information on templates.
	* src/main.cpp (main): fixed option parsing bug.
	(class ipaddr): created class for IP addresses
	(class flow_state_struct): created class from struct
	* src/main.cpp (print_usage): -X added for XML output.
	* src/main.cpp (main): changed bytes_per_flow from int to uint64_t
	progname is now a global.
	* src/main.cpp (main): added -B option to force binary output.
	* src/util.cpp: removed copy_argv(); replaced with a simple std::string manipulation.
	(flow_filename): modified to work with outdir
	* src/tcpip.c (print_packet): modified to respect bytes_per_flow
	* src/main.c (main): removed prepending of (ip or ip6 or vlan) from user expressions. We now just use what the user provided.
