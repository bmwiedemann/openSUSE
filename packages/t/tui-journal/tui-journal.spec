%description
TUI-Journal is a terminal-based application written in Rust that allows
you to write and manage your journal/notes from within the comfort of your
terminal. It provides a simple and efficient interface for creating and
organizing your thoughts, ideas, and reflections. TUI-Journal supports two
different local back-ends: a plain text back-end in JSON format and a
database back-end using SQLite.
