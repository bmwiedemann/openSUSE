    <comment>- Update to version 1.3
  * Improved performance
  * Improved graphics
  * Added Reimu character
  * New scoring mechanic
  * New shot mode B for Marisa character
  * Added Music Room
  * Changed Bombs
  * Fixed collisions
  * Improved bullet patterns
- Tōhō -&gt; Touhou for better discoverability 
- Update to version 1.2, adding tons of new game content
- Remove taisei-make-rpmlint-happy.patch
- Remove add taisei-use-std-gnu11.patch
- Fix ppc64le
  * add taisei-use-std-gnu11.patch
- Split data files into separate RPM package
- spec-cleaner
- Add taisei-make-rpmlint-happy.patch
- Update to version 1.1.2
  * Flush stdio on logging shutdown
  * Make sfx/bgm resources always optional
  * Improvements to vfs code
  * Avoid strtok_r clashes with libc implementations
  * Fix fullscreen/window management issues
  * More robust SDL video driver selection
  * Fix capitalization of Occam’s Razor
  * Fix SDL2_mixer initialization
- Update to version 1.1.1
  * Vertical synchronization (vsync) is now disabled by default,
    as it causes percieved input latency for some players.
    If you'd like to use it and/or you have screen tearing
    problems, you should set it to &quot;on&quot; or &quot;adaptive&quot; in the video
    settings.
  * The event/input processing system has been completely
    rewritten, and unicode text input now works correctly.
  * Reimplemented the framerate limiter. It's significantly more
    accurate now and attempts to compensate for sudden frametime
    spikes. This makes the game much more likely to run at exactly
    the intended speed (60 frames per second).
  * The character's Power is now also displayed as a numeric value,
    in addition to the stars bar.
  * Fixed an unpleasant artifact in the boss background shader.
  * Fixed the &quot;letterboxing&quot; artifacts on some systems on non-4:3
    resolutions.
  * Updated the SDL game controller database. More gamepads are
    supported out-of-the-box now.
  * Fixed the character getting stuck moving in some direction when
    using some gamepads in the &quot;restricted&quot; axes mode.
  * Fixed memory corruption that could occur when a gamepad has
    fewer axes than expected of an Xbox-like controller.
- Initial package

    gh#taisei-project/taisei##371
  * Optimized a few hot paths in the game update loop.
  * Optimized the tree branch mesh in the Stage 2 background to
    avoid rendering a lot of tiny triangles.

    <comment>- Update to version 1.4.2
This is a stable maintenance release. It features some bugfixes,
optimizations, and other improvements backported from the v1.5
development tree.
  * Reworked gamepad input handling and configuration:
  * The free/restricted axis distinction is gone; the joystick
    always operates in &quot;free&quot; mode.
  * Added direction snapping functionality to help aid exact
    movement in cardinal and/or diagonal directions. The snapping
    angle can be adjusted from 0% (disabled) to 100% (similar to
    the old &quot;restricted&quot; mode). The snapping angle can also be
    biased towards cardinals or diagonals.
  * When the maximum zone is less than or equals dead zone, moving
    the character will always move at maximum speed (as in the old
    &quot;restricted&quot; mode).
  * Most of these settings are now visualized in the options menu
    and can be tested there.
  * Changed the default Spell Card (Bomb) and Power Surage gamepad
    bindings to Left Trigger and Right Trigger respectively.
  * If autorestart is enabled for spell practice, it will now try
    to load a quicksave if one exists.
  * Added a &quot;load quicksave&quot; option to the pause menu in practice
    modes.
  * Cutscenes that have been seen before can now be completely
    skipped.
  * Added an option to reset the config to last saved values.
  * Reduced some sprite batching CPU overhead.
  * Optimized rendering of scenes with many lasers.
  * Optimized loading of webp files.
  * Optimized various math routines.</comment>
