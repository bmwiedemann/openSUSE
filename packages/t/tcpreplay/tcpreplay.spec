%description
Tcpreplay is a suite of utilities for editing and replaying
previously captured network traffic. It was originally designed to
replay malicious traffic patterns to Intrusion Detection/Prevention
Systems, and is meanwhile capable of replaying to web servers. It
supports switches, routers and IP Flow/NetFlow appliances.
