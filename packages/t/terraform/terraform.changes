Mon Nov 14 17:01:59 UTC 2022 - Jan Kohoutek <jkohoutek@suse.com>

- update to 1.3.4:
  * BUG FIXES:
    - Fix invalid refresh-only plan caused by data sources being deferred to apply (#32111)
    - Optimize the handling of condition checks during apply to prevent performance regressions with large numbers of instances (#32123)
    - Output preconditions should not be evaluated during destroy (#32051)
    - Fix crash from console when outputs contain preconditions (#32051)
    - Destroy with no state would still attempt to evaluate some values (#32051)
    - Prevent unnecessary evaluation and planning of resources during the pre-destroy refresh (#32051)
    - AzureRM Backend: support for generic OIDC authentication via the oidc_token and oidc_token_file_path properties (#31966)
    - Input and Module Variables: Convert variable types before attempting to apply default values. (#32027)
    - When installing remote module packages delivered in tar format, Terraform now limits the tar header block size to 1MiB to avoid unbounded memory usage for maliciously-crafted module packages. (#32135)
    - Terraform will now reject excessively-complex regular expression patterns passed to the regex, regexall, and replace functions, to avoid unbounded memory usage for maliciously-crafted patterns. This change should not affect any reasonable patterns intended for practical use. (#32135)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct 19 18:15:02 UTC 2022 - Johannes Kastl <kastl@b1-systems.de>

- update to 1.3.3:
  * BUG FIXES:
    - Fix error when removing a resource from configuration which has according to the provider has already been deleted. (#31850)
    - Fix error when setting empty collections into variables with collections of nested objects with default values. (#32033)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct  7 08:55:12 UTC 2022 - Johannes Kastl <kastl@b1-systems.de>

- update to 1.3.2:
  * BUG FIXES:
    - Fixed a crash caused by Terraform incorrectly re-registering output value preconditions during the apply phase (rather than just reusing the already-planned checks from the plan phase). (#31890)
    - Prevent errors when the provider reports that a deposed instance no longer exists (#31902)

- update to 1.3.1:
  * BUG FIXES:
    - Fixed a crash when using objects with optional attributes and default values in collections, most visible with nested modules. (#31847)
    - Prevent cycles in some situations where a provider depends on resources in the configuration which are participating in planned changes. (#31857)
    - Fixed an error when attempting to destroy a configuration where resources do not exist in the state. (#31858)
    - Data sources which cannot be read during will no longer prevent the state from being serialized. (#31871)
    - Fixed a crash which occured when a resource with a precondition and/or a postcondition appeared inside a module with two or more instances. (#31860)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Sep 25 07:06:14 UTC 2022 - Johannes Kastl <kastl@b1-systems.de>

- update to 1.3.0:
  * NEW FEATURES:
    - Optional attributes for object type constraints: When declaring an input variable whose type constraint includes an object type, you can now declare individual attributes as optional, and specify a default value to use if the caller doesn't set it. For example:
    - Added functions: startswith and endswith allow you to check whether a given string has a specified prefix or suffix. (#31220)
  * UPGRADE NOTES:
    - terraform show -json: Output changes now include more detail about the unknown-ness of the planned value. Previously, a planned output would be marked as either fully known or partially unknown, with the after_unknown field having value false or true respectively. Now outputs correctly expose the full structure of unknownness for complex values, allowing consumers of the JSON output format to determine which values in a collection are known only after apply.
    - terraform import: The -allow-missing-config has been removed, and at least an empty configuration block must exist to import a resource.
    - Consumers of the JSON output format expecting on the after_unknown field to be only false or true should be updated to support the change representation described in the documentation, and as was already used for resource changes. (#31235)
    - AzureRM Backend: This release concludes the deprecation cycle started in Terraform v1.1 for the azurerm backend's support of "ADAL" authentication. This backend now supports only "MSAL" (Microsoft Graph) authentication.
    - This follows from Microsoft's own deprecation of Azure AD Graph, and so you must follow the migration instructions presented in that Azure documentation to adopt Microsoft Graph and then change your backend configuration to use MSAL authentication before upgrading to Terraform v1.3.
    - When making requests to HTTPS servers, Terraform will now reject invalid handshakes that have duplicate extensions, as required by RFC 5246 section 7.4.1.4 and RFC 8446 section 4.2. This may cause new errors when interacting with existing buggy or misconfigured TLS servers, but should not affect correct servers.
    - This only applies to requests made directly by Terraform CLI, such as provider installation and remote state storage. Terraform providers are separate programs which decide their own policy for handling of TLS handshakes.
    - The following backends, which were deprecated in v1.2.3, have now been removed: artifactory, etcd, etcdv3, manta, swift. The legacy backend name azure has also been removed, because the current Azure backend is named azurerm. (#31711)
  * ENHANCEMENTS:
    - config: Optional attributes for object type constraints, as described under new features above. (#31154)
    - config: New built-in function timecmp allows determining the ordering relationship between two timestamps while taking potentially-different UTC offsets into account. (#31687)
    - config: When reporting an error message related to a function call, Terraform will now include contextual information about the signature of the function that was being called, as an aid to understanding why the call might have failed. (#31299)
    - config: When reporting an error or warning message that isn't caused by values being unknown or marked as sensitive, Terraform will no longer mention any values having those characteristics in the contextual information presented alongside the error. Terraform will still return this information for the small subset of error messages that are specifically about unknown values or sensitive values being invalid in certain contexts. (#31299)
    - config: moved blocks can now describe resources moving to and from modules in separate module packages. (#31556)
    - terraform fmt now accepts multiple target paths, allowing formatting of several individual files at once. (#31687)
    - terraform init: provider installation errors now mention which host Terraform was downloading from (#31524)
    - CLI: Terraform will report more explicitly when it is proposing to delete an object due to it having moved to a resource instance that is not currently declared in the configuration. (#31695)
    - CLI: When showing the progress of a remote operation running in Terraform Cloud, Terraform CLI will include information about pre-plan run tasks (#31617)
    - The AzureRM Backend now only supports MSAL (and Microsoft Graph) and no longer makes use of ADAL (and Azure Active Directory Graph) for authentication (#31070)
    - The COS backend now supports global acceleration. (#31425)
    - provider plugin protocol: The Terraform CLI now calls PlanResourceChange for compatible providers when destroying resource instances. (#31179)
    - As an implementation detail of the Terraform Cloud integration, Terraform CLI will now capture and upload the JSON integration format for state along with any newly-recorded state snapshots, which then in turn allows Terraform Cloud to provide that information to API-based external integrations. (#31698)
  * BUG FIXES:
    - config: Terraform was not previously evaluating preconditions and postconditions during the apply phase for resource instances that didn't have any changes pending, which was incorrect because the outcome of a condition can potentially be affected by changes to other objects in the configuration. Terraform will now always check the conditions for every resource instance included in a plan during the apply phase, even for resource instances that have "no-op" changes. This means that some failures that would previously have been detected only by a subsequent run will now be detected during the same run that caused them, thereby giving the feedback at the appropriate time. (#31491)
    - terraform show -json: Fixed missing markers for unknown values in the encoding of partially unknown tuples and sets. (#31236)
    - terraform output CLI help documentation is now more consistent with web-based documentation. (#29354)
    - terraform init: Error messages now handle the situation where the underlying HTTP client library does not indicate a hostname for a failed request. (#31542)
    - terraform init: Don't panic if a child module contains a resource with a syntactically-invalid resource type name. (#31573)
    - CLI: The representation of destroying already-null output values in a destroy plan will no longer report them as being deleted, which avoids reporting the deletion of an output value that was already absent. (#31471)
    - terraform import: Better handling of resources or modules that use for_each, and situations where data resources are needed to complete the operation. (#31283)
  * EXPERIMENTS:
    - This release concludes the module_variable_optional_attrs experiment, which started in Terraform v0.14.0. The final design of the optional attributes feature is similar to the experimental form in the previous releases, but with two major differences:
    - The optional function-like modifier for declaring an optional attribute now accepts an optional second argument for specifying a default value to use when the attribute isn't set by the caller. If not specified, the default value is a null value of the appropriate type as before.
    - The built-in defaults function, previously used to meet the use-case of replacing null values with default values, will not graduate to stable and has been removed. Use the second argument of optional inline in your type constraint to declare default values instead.
    - If you have any experimental modules that were participating in this experiment, you will need to remove the experiment opt-in and adopt the new syntax for declaring default values in order to migrate your existing module to the stablized version of this feature. If you are writing a shared module for others to use, we recommend declaring that your module requires Terraform v1.3.0 or later to give specific feedback when using the new feature on older Terraform versions, in place of the previous declaration to use the experimental form of this feature:
        terraform {
            required_version = ">= 1.3.0"
        }

  * ENHANCEMENTS:
    - terraform init: add link to documentation when a checksum is missing from the lock file. (#31726)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep  7 09:12:41 UTC 2022 - Johannes Kastl <kastl@b1-systems.de>

- update to 1.2.8:
  * BUG FIXES:
    - config: The flatten function will no longer panic if given a null value that has been explicitly converted to or implicitly inferred as having a list, set, or tuple type. Previously Terraform would panic in such a situation because it tried to "flatten" the contents of the null value into the result, which is impossible. (#31675)
    - config: The tolist, toset, and tomap functions, and various automatic conversions that include similar logic, will no longer panic when asked to infer an element type that is convertable from both a tuple type and a list type whose element type is not yet known. (#31675)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep  7 09:11:41 UTC 2022 - Johannes Kastl <kastl@b1-systems.de>

- update to 1.2.7:
  * ENHANCEMENTS:
    - config: Check for direct references to deprecated computed attributes. (#31576)
  * BUG FIXES:
    - config: Fix an crash if a submodule contains a resource whose implied provider local name contains invalid characters, by adding additional validation rules to turn it into a real error. (#31573)
    - core: Fix some handling of provider schema attributes which use the newer "structural typing" mechanism introduced with protocol version 6, and therefore with the new Terraform Plugin Framework (#31532)
    - command: Add missing output text for applyable refresh plans. (#31469)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul 27 16:18:39 UTC 2022 - Johannes Kastl <kastl@b1-systems.de>

- update to 1.2.6:
  * ENHANCEMENTS:
    - Add a warning and guidance when terraform init fails to fully populate the .terraform.lock.hcl file. (#31399)
    - Add a direct link to the relevant documentation when terraform init fails on missing checksums. (#31408)
  * BUG FIXES:
    - Fix panic on terraform show when state file is invalid or unavailable. (#31444)
    - Fix terraform providers lock command failing on missing checksums. (#31389)
    - Some combinations of move block operations would be executed in the wrong order (#31499)
    - Don't attribute an error to the provider when a computed attribute is listed in ignore_changes (#31509)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jul 16 19:11:52 UTC 2022 - Johannes Kastl <kastl@b1-systems.de>

- update to 1.2.5:
  * BUG FIXES:
    - Report correct error message when a prerelease field is included in the required_version global constraint. (#31331)
    - Fix case when extra blank lines were inserted into the plan for unchanged blocks. (#31330)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun 29 18:23:23 UTC 2022 - Johannes Kastl <kastl@b1-systems.de>

- Update to 1.2.4:
  * ENHANCEMENTS:
    - Improved validation of required_providers to prevent single providers from being required with multiple names. (#31218)
    - Improved plan performance by optimizing addrs.Module.String for allocations. (#31293)
  * BUG FIXES:
    - backend/http: Fixed bug where the HTTP backend would fail to retry acquiring the state lock and ignored the -lock-timeout flag. (#31256)
    - Fix crash if a precondition or postcondition block omitted the required condition argument. (#31290)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun 22 07:58:20 UTC 2022 - Johannes Kastl <kastl@b1-systems.de>

- Update to 1.2.3:
  * UPGRADE NOTES:
    The following remote state backends are now marked as deprecated, and are
    planned to be removed in a future Terraform release. These backends have
    been unmaintained since before Terraform v1.0, and may contain known bugs,
    outdated packages, or security vulnerabilities.
    - artifactory
    - etcd
    - etcdv3
    - manta
    - swift
  * BUG FIXES:
    - Missing check for error diagnostics in GetProviderSchema could result in panic (#31184)
    - Module registries returning X-Terraform-Get locations with no URL would error with "no getter available for X-Terraform-Get source protocol" (#31237)
    - Fix crash from concurrent operation on shared set of resource instance dependencies (#31246)
    - backend/cos: tencentcloud-terraform-lock tag was not removed in all cases (#31223)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jun 05 12:36:36 UTC 2022 - kastl@b1-systems.de

- Update to version 1.2.2:
  * ENHANCEMENTS:
    - Invalid -var arguments with spaces between the name and value now have an improved error message (#30985)

    - Fixed crash on CLI autocomplete (#31160)
    - The "Configuration contains unknown values" error message now includes attribute paths (#31111)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jun  4 20:03:11 UTC 2022 - Johannes Kastl <kastl@b1-systems.de>

- BuildRequire go1.17, like upstream does in go.mod

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jun 04 19:53:14 UTC 2022 - kastl@b1-systems.de

- Update to version 1.2.1:
  * BUG FIXES:
    - SSH provisioner connections fail when using signed ed25519 keys (#31092)
    - Crash with invalid module source (#31060)
    - Incorrect "Module is incompatible with count, for_each, and depends_on" error when a provider is nested within a module along with a sub-module using count or for_each (#31091)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jun 04 19:43:24 UTC 2022 - kastl@b1-systems.de

- Update to version 1.2.0:
  * UPGRADE NOTES:
    - If you use the third-party credentials helper plugin terraform-credentials-env, you should disable it as part of upgrading to Terraform v1.2 because similar functionality is now built in to Terraform itself.
    - The new behavior supports the same environment variable naming scheme but has a difference in priority order from the credentials helper: TF_TOKEN_... environment variables will now take priority over credentials blocks in CLI configuration and credentials stored automatically by terraform login, which is not true for credentials provided by any credentials helper plugin. If you see Terraform using different credentials after upgrading, check to make sure you do not specify credentials for the same host in multiple locations.
    - If you use the credentials helper in conjunction with the hashicorp/tfe Terraform provider to manage Terraform Cloud or Terraform Enterprise objects with Terraform, you should also upgrade to version 0.31 of that provider, which added the corresponding built-in support for these environment variables.
    - The official Linux packages for the v1.2 series now require Linux kernel version 2.6.32 or later.
    - When making outgoing HTTPS or other TLS connections as a client, Terraform now requires the server to support TLS v1.2. TLS v1.0 and v1.1 are no longer supported. Any safely up-to-date server should support TLS 1.2, and mainstream web browsers have required it since 2020.
    - When making outgoing HTTPS or other TLS connections as a client, Terraform will no longer accept CA certificates signed using the SHA-1 hash function. Publicly trusted Certificate Authorities have not issued SHA-1 certificates since 2015.
      (Note: the changes to Terraform's requirements when interacting with TLS servers apply only to requests made by Terraform CLI itself, such as provider/module installation and state storage requests. Terraform provider plugins include their own TLS clients which may have different requirements, and may add new requirements in their own releases, independently of Terraform CLI changes.)
  * NEW FEATURES:
    - precondition and postcondition check blocks for resources, data sources, and module output values: module authors can now document assumptions and assertions about configuration and state values. If these conditions are not met, Terraform will report a custom error message to the user and halt further execution.
    - replace_triggered_by is a new lifecycle argument for managed resources which triggers replacement of an object based on changes to an upstream dependency.
    You can now specify credentials for Terraform-native services using an environment variable named as TF_TOKEN_ followed by an encoded version of the hostname. For example, Terraform will use variable TF_TOKEN_app_terraform_io as a bearer token for requests to "app.terraform.io", for the Terraform Cloud integration and private registry requests.
  * ENHANCEMENTS:
    - When showing a plan, Terraform CLI will now only show "Changes outside of Terraform" if they relate to resources and resource attributes that contributed to the changes Terraform is proposing to make. (#30486)
    - Error messages for preconditions, postconditions, and custom variable validations are now evaluated as expressions, allowing interpolation of relevant values into the output. (#30613)
    - When showing the progress of a remote operation running in Terraform Cloud, Terraform CLI will include information about post-plan run tasks. (#30141)
    - Terraform will now show a slightly different note in the plan output if a data resource read is deferred to the apply step due to it depending on a managed resource that has changes pending. (#30971)
    - The "Invalid for_each argument" error message for unknown maps/sets now includes an additional paragraph to try to help the user notice they can move apply-time values into the map values instead of the map keys, and thus avoid the problem without resorting to -target. (#30327)
    - There are some small improvements to the error and warning messages Terraform will emit in the case of invalid provider configuration passing between modules. There are no changes to which situations will produce errors and warnings, but the messages now include additional information intended to clarify what problem Terraform is describing and how to address it. (#30639)
    - The environment variables TF_CLOUD_ORGANIZATION and TF_CLOUD_HOSTNAME now serve as fallbacks for the arguments of the same name inside a cloud block configuring integration with Terraform Cloud.
    - The environment variable TF_WORKSPACE will now additionally serve as an implicit configuration of a single selected workspace on Terraform Cloud if (and only if) the cloud block does not include an explicit workspaces configuration.
    - The AzureRM Backend now defaults to using MSAL (and Microsoft Graph) rather than ADAL (and Azure Active Directory Graph) for authentication. (#30891)
    - The AzureRM Backend now supports authenticating as a service principal using OpenID Connect. (#30936)
    - When running on macOS, Terraform will now use platform APIs to validate certificates presented by TLS (HTTPS) servers. This may change exactly which root certificates Terraform will accept as valid. (#30768)
    - Show remote host in error message for clarity when installation of provider fails (#30810)
    - Terraform now prints a warning when adding an attribute to ignore_changes that is managed only by the provider. Specifying non-configurable attributes in ignore_changes has no effect because ignore_changes tells Terraform to ignore future changes made in the configuration. (#30517)
    - terraform show -json now includes exact type information for output values. (#30945)
    - The ssh provisioner connection now supports SSH over HTTP proxy. (#30274)
    -     The SSH client for provisioners now supports newer key algorithms, allowing it to connect to servers running more recent versions of OpenSSH. (#30962)
  * BUG FIXES:
    - Terraform now handles type constraints, nullability, and custom variable validation properly for root module variables. Previously there was an order of operations problem where the nullability and custom variable validation were checked too early, prior to dealing with the type constraints, and thus that logic could potentially "see" an incorrectly-typed value in spite of the type constraint, leading to incorrect errors. (#29959)
    - When reporting a type mismatch between the true and false results of a conditional expression when both results are of the same structural type kind (object/tuple, or a collection thereof), Terraform will no longer return a confusing message like "the types are object and object, respectively", and will instead attempt to explain how the two structural types differ. (#30920)
    - Applying the various type conversion functions like tostring, tonumber, etc to null will now return a null value of the intended type. For example, tostring(null) converts from a null value of an unknown type to a null value of string type. Terraform can often handle such conversions automatically when needed, but explicit annotations like this can help Terraform to understand author intent when inferring type conversions for complex-typed values. (#30879)
    - Terraform now returns an error when cidrnetmask() is called with an IPv6 address, as it was previously documented to do. IPv6 standards do not preserve the "netmask" syntax sometimes used for IPv4 network configuration; use CIDR prefix syntax instead. (#30703)
    - When performing advanced state management with the terraform state commands, Terraform now checks the required_version field in the configuration before proceeding. (#30511)
    - When rendering a diff, Terraform now quotes the name of any object attribute whose string representation is not a valid identifier. (#30766)
    - Terraform will now prioritize local terraform variables over remote terraform variables in operations such as import, plan, refresh and apply for workspaces in local execution mode. This behavior applies to both remote backend and the cloud integration configuration. (#29972)
    - terraform show -json: JSON plan output now correctly maps aliased providers to their configurations, and includes the full provider source address alongside the short provider name. (#30138)
    - The local token configuration in the cloud and remote backend now has higher priority than a token specified in a credentials block in the CLI configuration. (#30664)
    - The cloud integration now gracefully exits when -input=false and an operation requires some user input.
    - Terraform will now reliably detect an inteerruptiong (e.g. Ctrl+C) during planning for terraform apply -auto-approve. Previously there was a window of time where interruption would cancel the plan step but not prevent Terraform from proceeding to the apply step. (#30979)
    - Terraform will no longer crash if a provider fails to return a schema. (#30987)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May  4 06:07:40 UTC 2022 - Paolo Stivanin <info@paolostivanin.com>

  * cli: Fix double-quoted map keys when rendering a diff. (#30855)
  * core: Prevent errors when handling a data source with incompatible schema changes (#30830)
  * cli: Fix missing identifying attributes (e.g. "id", "name") when displaying plan diffs with nested objects. (#30685)
  * functions: Fix error when sum() function is called with a collection of string-encoded numbers, such as sum(["1", "2", "3"]). (#30684)
  * When rendering a diff, Terraform now quotes the name of any object attribute whose string representation is not a valid identifier. (#30766)
  * Terraform will no longer crash in the terraform apply phase if an error occurs during backend configuration. (#30780)
  * terraform show -json: Improve performance for deeply-nested object values. The previous implementation was accidentally quadratic, which could result in very long execution time for generating JSON plans, and timeouts on Terraform Cloud and Terraform Enterprise. (#30561)
  * cloud: Update go-slug for terraform.tfstate exclusion to prevent a user from getting an error
after migrating state to TFC.

Wed Dec 29 17:21:18 UTC 2021 - Marcus Hann <marcus@hhra.uk>

- Update to 1.1.2
  If you are using Terraform CLI v1.1.0 or v1.1.1, please upgrade to this new version as soon as possible.

  Terraform CLI v1.1.0 and v1.1.1 both have a bug where a failure to construct the apply-time graph can cause Terraform to incorrectly report success and save an empty state, effectively "forgetting" all existing infrastructure. Although configurations that already worked on previous releases should not encounter this problem, it's possible that incorrect future configuration changes would trigger this behavior during the apply step. 

  BUG FIXES:
  * config: Fix panic when using -target in combination with moved blocks within modules (#30189)
  * core: Fix condition which could lead to an empty state being written when there is a failure building the apply graph (#30199)
- From version 1.1.1
  BUG FIXES:
  * core: Fix crash with orphaned module instance due to changed count or for_each value (#30151)
  * core: Fix regression where some expressions failed during validation when referencing resources expanded with count or for_each (#30171)

Thu Dec  9 11:54:23 UTC 2021 - Marcus Hann <marcus@hhra.uk>

- Update to 1.1.0
  Terraform v1.1.0 is a new minor release, containing some new features and some bug fixes whose scope was too large for inclusion in a patch release.

  NEW FEATURES:
  * `moved` blocks for refactoring within modules: Module authors can now record in module source code whenever they've changed the address of a resource or resource instance, and then during planning Terraform will automatically migrate existing objects in the state to new addresses.

      This therefore avoids the need for users of a shared module to manually run `terraform state mv` after upgrading to a version of the module, as long as the change is expressible as static configuration. However, `terraform state mv` will remain available for use in more complex migration situations that are not well-suited to declarative configuration.
* A new `cloud` block in the `terraform` settings block introduces a native Terraform Cloud integration for the [CLI-driven run workflow](https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/run/cli.html).

    The Cloud integration includes several enhancements, including per-run variable support using the `-var` flag, the ability to map Terraform Cloud workspaces to the current configuration via [Workspace Tags](https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/api/workspaces.html#get-tags), and an improved user experience for Terraform Cloud and Enterprise users with actionable error messages and prompts.
  * `terraform plan` and `terraform apply` both now include additional annotations for resource instances planned for deletion to explain why Terraform has proposed that action.

      For example, if you change the `count` argument for a resource to a lower number then Terraform will now mention that as part of proposing to destroy any existing objects that exceed the new count.

  UPGRADE NOTES:
  This release is covered by the [Terraform v1.0 Compatibility Promises](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/v1-compatibility-promises.html), but does include some changes permitted within those promises as described below.

  * Terraform on macOS now requires macOS 10.13 High Sierra or later; Older macOS versions are no longer supported.
  * The `terraform graph` command no longer supports `-type=validate` and `-type=eval` options. The validate graph is always the same as the plan graph anyway, and the "eval" graph was just an implementation detail of the `terraform console` command. The default behavior of creating a plan graph should be a reasonable replacement for both of the removed graph modes. (Please note that `terraform graph` is not covered by the Terraform v1.0 compatibility promises, because its behavior inherently exposes Terraform Core implementation details, so we recommend it only for interactive debugging tasks and not for use in automation.)
  * `terraform apply` with a previously-saved plan file will now verify that the provider plugin packages used to create the plan fully match the ones used during apply, using the same checksum scheme that Terraform normally uses for the dependency lock file. Previously Terraform was checking consistency of plugins from a plan file using a legacy mechanism which covered only the main plugin executable, not any other files that might be distributed alongside in the plugin package.

      This additional check should not affect typical plugins that conform to the expectation that a plugin package's contents are immutable once released, but may affect a hypothetical in-house plugin that intentionally modifies extra files in its package directory somehow between plan and apply. If you have such a plugin, you'll need to change its approach to store those files in some other location separate from the package directory. This is a minor compatibility break motivated by increasing the assurance that plugins have not been inadvertently or maliciously modified between plan and apply.
  * `terraform state mv` will now error when legacy `-backup` or `-backup-out` options are used without the `-state` option on non-local backends. These options operate on a local state file only. Previously, these options were accepted but ignored silently when used with non-local backends. 
  * In the AzureRM backend, the new opt-in option `use_microsoft_graph` switches to using MSAL authentication tokens and Microsoft Graph rather than using ADAL tokens and Azure Active Directory Graph, which is now [deprecated by Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/migrate-azure-ad-graph-faq). The new mode will become the default in Terraform v1.2, so please plan to migrate to using this setting and test with your own Azure AD tenant prior to the Terraform v1.2 release.

  ENHANCEMENTS:
  * config: Terraform now checks the syntax of and normalizes module source addresses (the `source` argument in `module` blocks) during configuration decoding rather than only at module installation time. This is largely just an internal refactoring, but a visible benefit of this change is that the `terraform init` messages about module downloading will now show the canonical module package address Terraform is downloading from, after interpreting the special shorthands for common cases like GitHub URLs. ([#28854](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/28854))
  * config: Variables can now be declared as "nullable", which defines whether a variable can be null within a module. Setting `nullable = false` ensures that a variable value will never be `null`, and may instead take on the variable's default value if the caller sets it explicitly to `null`. ([#29832](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/29832))
  * `terraform plan` and `terraform apply`: When Terraform plans to destroy a resource instance due to it no longer being declared in the configuration, the proposed plan output will now include a note hinting at what situation prompted that proposal, so you can more easily see what configuration change might avoid the object being destroyed. ([#29637](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/pull/29637))
  * `terraform plan` and `terraform apply`: Terraform will now report explicitly in the UI if it automatically moves a resource instance to a new address as a result of adding or removing the `count` argument from an existing resource. For example, if you previously had `resource "aws_subnet" "example"` _without_ `count`, you might have `aws_subnet.example` already bound to a remote object in your state. If you add `count = 1` to that resource then Terraform would previously silently rebind the object to `aws_subnet.example[0]` as part of planning, whereas now Terraform will mention that it did so explicitly in the plan description. ([#29605](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/29605))
  * `terraform workspace delete`: will now allow deleting a workspace whose state contains only data resource instances and output values, without running `terraform destroy` first. Previously the presence of data resources would require using `-force` to override the safety check guarding against accidentally forgetting about remote objects, but a data resource is not responsible for the management of its associated remote object(s) and so there's no reason to require explicit deletion. ([#29754](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/29754))
  * `terraform validate`: Terraform now uses precise type information for resources during config validation, allowing more problems to be caught that that step rather than only during the planning step. ([#29862](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/29862))
  * provisioner/remote-exec and provisioner/file: When using SSH agent authentication mode on Windows, Terraform can now detect and use [the Windows 10 built-in OpenSSH Client](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell/using-the-openssh-beta-in-windows-10-fall-creators-update-and-windows-server-1709/)'s SSH Agent, when available, in addition to the existing support for the third-party solution [Pageant](https://documentation.help/PuTTY/pageant.html) that was already supported. ([#29747](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/29747))
  * cli: `terraform state mv` will now return an error for `-backup` or `-backup-out` options used without the `-state` option, unless the working directory is initialized to use the local backend. Previously Terraform would silently ignore those options, since they are applicable only to the local backend. ([#27908](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/27908))
  * `terraform console`: now has a new `type()` function, available only in the interactive console, for inspecting the exact type of a particular value as an aid to debugging. ([#28501](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/28501))

  BUG FIXES:
  * config: `ignore_changes = all` now works in override files. ([#29849](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/29849))
  * config: Upgrading an unknown single value to a list using a splat expression now correctly returns an unknown value and type. Previously it would sometimes "overpromise" a particular return type, leading to an inconsistency error during the apply step. ([#30062](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/30062))
  * config: Terraform is now more precise in its detection of data resources that must be deferred to the apply step due to their `depends_on` arguments referring to not-yet-converged managed resources. ([#29682](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/29682))
  * config: `ignore_changes` can no longer cause a null map to be converted to an empty map, which would otherwise potentially cause surprising side-effects in provider logic. ([#29928](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/29928))
  * core: Provider configuration obtained from interactive prompts will now be merged properly with settings given in the configuration. Previously this merging was incorrect in some cases. ([#29000](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/29000))
  * `terraform plan`: Improved rendering of changes inside attributes that accept lists, sets, or maps of nested object types. ([#29827](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/29827), [#29983](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/29983), [#29986](https://github.com/terraform/issues/29986))
  * `terraform apply`: Will no longer try to apply a stale plan that was generated against an originally-empty state. Previously this was an unintended exception to the rule that a plan can only be applied to the state snapshot it was generated against. ([#29755](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/29755))
  * `terraform show -json`: Attributes that are declared as using the legacy [Attributes as Blocks](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/attr-as-blocks.html) behavior are now represented more faithfully in the JSON plan output. ([#29522](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/29522))
  * `terraform init`: Will now update the backend configuration hash value at a more approprimate time, to ensure properly restarting a backend migration process that failed on the first attempt. ([#29860](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/29860))
  * backend/oss: Flatten `assume_role` block arguments, so that they are more compatible with the `terraform_remote_state` data source. ([#29307](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/29307))

- from version 1.0.0
  Terraform v1.0 is an unusual release in that its primary focus is on stability, and it represents the
  culmination of several years of work in previous major releases to make sure that the Terraform language
  and internal architecture will be a suitable foundation for forthcoming additions that will remain
  backward compatible.

  Terraform v1.0.0 intentionally has no significant changes compared to Terraform v0.15.5. You can consider
  the v1.0 series as a direct continuation of the v0.15 series; we do not intend to issue any further releases
  in the v0.15 series, because all of the v1.0 releases will be only minor updates to address bugs.

  For all future minor releases with major version 1, we intend to preserve backward compatibility as described
  in detail in [the Terraform v1.0 Compatibility Promises](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/v1-compatibility-
  promises.html). The later Terraform v1.1.0 will, therefore, be the first minor release with new features that
  we will implement with consideration of those promises.
- from version 0.15.5
  BUG FIXES:
  * `terraform plan` and `terraform apply`: Don't show "Objects have changed" notification
     when the detected changes are only internal details related to legacy SDK quirks. (#28796)
  * core: Prevent crash during planning when encountering a deposed instance that has been
    removed from the configuration. (#28766)
  * core: Fix crash when rendering changes to deposed instances outside of Terraform. (#28796)
  * core: Restore a missing error when attempting to import a non-existent remote object. (#28808)
  * core: Fix bug where Terraform failed to release the state lock when applying a stale
    saved plan failed. (#28819)
- from version 0.15.4
  NEW FEATURES:
  * **Noting changes made outside of Terraform:** Terraform has always, by default, made a point
    during the planning operation of reading the current state of remote objects in order to detect
    any changes made outside of Terraform, to make sure the plan will take those into account.

    Terraform will now report those detected changes as part of the plan result, in order to give
    additional context about the planned changes. We've often heard that people find it confusing
    when a plan includes a change that doesn't seem to be prompted by any recent change in the
    _configuration_, and so this feature is aiming to provide the previously-missing explanation
    for situations where Terraform is planning to undo a change.
    
    It can also be useful just as general information when the change _won't_ be undone by Terraform:
    if you've intentionally made a change outside of Terraform and mirrored that change in your
    configuration then Terraform will now confirm that it noticed the change you made and took it
    into account when planning.
    
    By default this new output is for information only and doesn't change any behavior. If Terraform
    detects a change you were _expecting_ then you don't need to take any additional action to respond
    to it. However, we've also added a new planning mode `-refresh-only` which allows you to explicitly
    plan and apply the action of writing those detected changes to the Terraform state, which serves
    as a plannable replacement for `terraform refresh`. We don't have any plans to remove the long-standing
    `terraform refresh` command, but we do recommend using `terraform apply -refresh-only` instead in most
    cases, because it will provide an opportunity to review what Terraform detected before updating the
    Terraform state.
  UPGRADE NOTES:
  * This release adds some new reserved reference prefixes to make them available for later work. These
    are `resource.`, `template.`, `arg.`, and `lazy.`. We don't expect these additions to cause problems
    for most existing configurations, but could cause a conflict if you are using a custom provider which
    has a resource type named exactly "resource", "template", "arg", or "lazy". In that unlikely event,
    you can escape references to resources of those types by adding a `resource.` prefix; for example,
    if you have a `resource "template" "foo"` then you can change references to it from `template.foo`
    to `resource.template.foo` in order to escape the new meaning.
  ENHANCEMENTS:
  * config: The various functions that compute hashs of files on disk, like `filesha256`, will now stream
    the contents of the given file into the hash function in smaller chunks. Previously they would always
    read the entire file into memory before hashing it, due to following a similar implementation strategy
    as the `file` function. (#28681)
  * config: Some new escaping syntax which is not yet useful but will be part of the backward-compatibility
    story for certain future language editions. (#28709)
  * core: Resource diagnostics are no longer lost on remote state storage failures (#28724)
  * core: Diagnostics from provisioner failures are now shown in CLI output (#28753)
  * `terraform init`: add a new `-migrate-state` flag instead of automatic state migration, to prevent failing
    when old backend config is not usable (#28718)
  * `terraform plan` and `terraform apply`: will now report any changes Terraform detects during the "refresh"
    phase for each managed object, providing confirmation that Terraform has seen those changes and, where
    appropriate, extra context to help understand the planned change actions that follow. (#28634)
  * `terraform plan` and `terraform apply`: now have a new option `-refresh-only` to activate the "refresh only"
    planning mode, which causes Terraform to ignore any changes suggested by the configuration but still detect
    any changes made outside of Terraform since the latest `terraform apply`. (#28634)
  * backend/gcs: Terraform Core now supports Workload Identity Federation. The federated JSON credentials must be
    loaded through the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable. This is also available in the Google
    Provider in versions newer than v3.61. (#28296)
  * backend/remote: supports several new CLI options when running plans and applies with Terraform Cloud:
    `-refresh=false`, `-replace`, and `-refresh-only`. (#28746)
  BUG FIXES:
  * core: Fix sensitivity handling with plan values, which could cause the sensitive marks to be lost during apply
    leading to a perpetual diff (#28687)
  * core: Fix crash when specifying SSH `bastion_port` in a resource `connection` block (#28665)
  * core: Terraform will now upgrade and refresh (unless disabled) deposed objects during planning, in a similar
    manner as for objects that have been removed from the configuration. "Deposed" is how Terraform represents
    the situation where a `create_before_destroy` replacement failed to destroy the old object, in which case
    Terraform needs to track both the new and old objects until the old object is successfully deleted. Refreshing
    these during planning means that you can, if you wish, delete a "deposed" object manually outside of Terraform
    and then have Terraform detect that you've done so. (#28634)
  * config: Improve the sensitivity support for `lookup` and `length` functions, which were accidentally omitted
    from the larger update in 0.15.1 (#28509)
  * backend/gcs: Fixed a bug where service account impersonation didn't work if the original identity was another
    service account (#28139)
- from version 0.15.3
  ENHANCEMENTS:
  * `terraform show`: Add data to the JSON plan output describing which changes caused a resource to be replaced
    (#28608)
  BUG FIXES:
  * `terraform show`: Fix crash for JSON plan output of new resources with sensitive attributes in nested blocks
    (#28624)
- from version 0.15.2
  ENHANCEMENTS:
  * `terraform plan` and `terraform apply`: Both now support a new planning option `-replace=...` which takes the
    address of a resource instance already tracked in the state and forces Terraform to upgrade either an update or
    no-op plan for that instance into a "replace" (either destroy-then-create or create-then-destroy depending on
    configuration), to allow replacing a degraded object with a new object of the same configuration in a single
    action and preview the effect of that before applying it.
  * `terraform apply`: Now has a `-destroy` option for symmetry with `terraform plan -destroy`, which makes `terraform
    destroy` effectively an alias for `terraform apply -destroy`. This change is only for consistency between `terraform
    plan` and `terraform apply`; there are no current plans to deprecate `terraform destroy`. (#28489)
  * core: Update HCL to allow better planning of dynamic blocks (#28424)
  * core: Unmark values when planning data sources (#28539)
  BUG FIXES:
  * command/format: Fix various issues with nested-type attribute formatting (#28600)
  * core: Fix JSON plan output to add sensitivity data for provider-specified sensitive attribute values (#28523)
  * cli: Fix missing "forces replacement" UI for attribute changes which are marked as sensitive by the provider (#28583)
  * cli: Fix crash when rendering diagnostic caused by missing trailing quote (#28598)
  * config: Fix crash when calling `setproduct` with one or more empty collections (#28607)
- from version 0.15.1
  ENHANCEMENTS:
  * config: Various Terraform language functions now have more precise inference rules for propagating the "sensitive"
    characteristic values.
 
    The affected functions are `chunklist`, `concat`, `flatten`, `keys`, `length`, `lookup`, `merge`, `setproduct`,
    `tolist`, `tomap`, `values`, and `zipmap`. The details are a little different for each of these but the general
    idea is to, as far as possible, preserve the sensitive characteristic on individual element or attribute values
    in result structures rather than always conservatively applying sensitivity to the whole result.
    
    The primary benefit of these improvements is that you can now use these functions as part of constructing maps for
    `for_each` in situations where the input collection is never sensitive but some of the elements/attributes inside
    might be. (#28446)
  * cli: Update the HashiCorp public key (#28505)
  * cli: Diagnostic messages can now be annotated with resource and provider addresses. (#28275)
  * cli: `terraform login` now has a new user experience for successful log-ins to Terraform Cloud and Terraform
    Enterprise. (#28487)
  * core: Minor graph performance optimizations. (#28329)
  BUG FIXES:
  * config: Fix validation error when passing providers from a non-default namespace into modules. (#28414)
  * cli: Fix missing colors and extraneous resource summary for plan/apply with the remote backend. (#28409)
  * cli: Diagnostics messages will only indicate that a referenced value is sensitive if that value is _directly_
    sensitive, as opposed to being a complex-typed value that _contains_ a sensitive value. (#28442)
  * core: Don't trigger data source reads from changes in sibling module instances. (#28267)
  * core: Restore saved dependencies when a resource destroy operation fails. (#28317)
  * core: Fix crash when setting sensitive attributes to a sensitive value. (#28383)
  * core: Loosen output value sensitivity requirement for non-root modules. This means that modules which may
    receive sensitive values as input variables no longer need to mark all related outputs as sensitive. The
    requirement for root modules to specify the `sensitive` attribute for sensitive values remains, with an
    extended diagnostic message to explain why. (#28472)
  * provisioner: Fix panic with unexpected null values in provisioner configuration (#28457)
- from version 0.15.0
  UPGRADE NOTES AND BREAKING CHANGES:

  The following is a summary of each of the changes in this release that might require special consideration
  when upgrading. Refer to [the Terraform v0.15 upgrade guide](https://www.terraform.io/upgrade-guides/0-15.html)
  for more details and recommended upgrade steps.

  * "Proxy configuration blocks" (provider blocks with only `alias` set) in shared modules are now replaced with a
    more explicit `configuration_aliases` argument within the `required_providers` block. Some support for the old
    syntax is retained for backward compatibility, but we've added explicit error messages for situations where
    Terraform would previously silently misinterpret the purpose of an empty `provider` block. (#27739)

  * The `list` and `map` functions, both of which were deprecated since Terraform v0.12, are now removed. You can
    replace uses of these functions with `tolist([...])` and `tomap({...})` respectively. (#26818)

  * Terraform now requires UTF-8 character encoding and virtual terminal support when running on Windows. This unifies
    Terraform's terminal handling on Windows with that of other platforms, as per [Microsoft recommendations]
    (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/console/classic-vs-vt). Terraform previously required these terminal
    features on all other platforms, and now requires them on Windows too.
    
    UTF-8 and virtual terminal support were introduced across various Windows 10 updates, and so Terraform is no longer
    officially supported on the original release of Windows 10 or on Windows 8 and earlier. However, there are currently
    no technical measures to artificially _prevent_ Terraform from running on these obsolete Windows releases, and so you
    _may_ still be able to use Terraform v0.15 on older Windows versions if you either disable formatting (using the
    `-no-color`) option, or if you use a third-party terminal emulator package such as [ConEmu](https://conemu.github.io/),
    [Cmder](https://cmder.net/), or [mintty](https://mintty.github.io/).
    
    We strongly encourage planning to migrate to a newer version of Windows rather than relying on these workarounds for
    the long term, because the Terraform team will test future releases only on up-to-date Windows 10 and can therefore
    not guarantee ongoing support for older versions.

  * Built-in vendor provisioners (chef, habitat, puppet, and salt-masterless) have been removed. (#26938)

  * Interrupting execution will now cause terraform to exit with a non-zero exit status. (#26738)

  * The trailing `[DIR]` argument to specify the working directory for various commands is no longer supported. Use the
    global `-chdir` option instead. (#27664)

    For example, instead of `terraform init infra`, write `terraform -chdir=infra init`.

  * The `-lock` and `-lock-timeout` options are no longer available on `terraform init` (#27464)

  * The `-verify-plugins=false` option is no longer available on `terraform init`. (Terraform now _always_ verifies plugins.)
    (#27461)

  * The `-get-plugins=false` option is no longer available on `terraform init`. (Terraform now _always_ installs plugins.)
    (#27463)

  * The `-force` option is no longer available on `terraform destroy`. Use `-auto-approve` instead (#27681)

  * The `-var` and `-var-file` options are no longer available on `terraform validate`. These were deprecated and have had
    no effect since Terraform v0.12. (#27906)

  * `terraform version -json` output no longer includes the (previously-unpopulated) "revision" property (#27484)

  * In the `gcs` backend the `path` config argument, which was deprecated since Terraform v0.11, is now removed. Use the
    `prefix` argument instead. (#26841)

  * The deprecated `ignore_changes = ["*"]` wildcard syntax is no longer supported. Use `ignore_changes = all` instead.
    (#27834)

  * Previously deprecated quoted variable type constraints are no longer supported. Follow the instructions in the error
    message to update your type signatures to be more explicit. For example, use `map(string)` instead of `"map"`. (#27852)

  * Terraform will no longer make use of the `HTTP_PROXY` environment variable to determine proxy settings for connecting
    to HTTPS servers. You must always set `HTTPS_PROXY` if you intend to use a proxy to connect to an HTTPS server.
    (Note: This affects only connections made directly from Terraform CLI. Terraform providers are separate programs that
    make their own requests and may thus have different proxy configuration behaviors.)

  * Provider-defined sensitive attributes will now be redacted throughout the plan output. You may now see values redacted
    as `(sensitive)` that were previously visible, because sensitivity did not follow provider-defined sensitive attributes.

    If you are transforming a value and wish to force it _not_ to be sensitive, such as if you are transforming a value in
    such a way that removes the sensitive data, we recommend using the new `nonsensitive` function to hint Terraform that
    the result is not sensitive.

  * The `atlas` backend, which was deprecated since Terraform v0.12, is now removed. (#26651)

  * We've upgraded the underlying TLS and certificate-related libraries that Terraform uses when making HTTPS requests to
    remote systems. This includes the usual tweaks to preferences for different cryptographic algorithms during handshakes
    and also some slightly-stricter checking of certificate syntax. These changes should not cause problems for correctly-
    implemented HTTPS servers, but can sometimes cause unexpected behavior changes with servers or middleboxes that don't
    comply fully with the relevant specifications.

  ENHANCEMENTS:
  * config: A `required_providers` entry can now contain `configuration_aliases` to declare additional configuration aliases
    names without requirring a configuration block (#27739)
  * config: Improved type inference for conditional expressions. (#28116)
  * config: Provider-defined sensitive attributes will now be redacted throughout the plan output. (#28036)
  * config: New function `one` for concisely converting a zero-or-one element list/set into a single value that might be `null`.
    (#27454)
  * config: New functions `sensitive` and `nonsensitive` allow module authors to explicitly override Terraform's default
    infererence of value sensitivity for situations where it's too conservative or not conservative enough. (#27341)
  * config: Terraform will now emit a warning if you declare a `backend` block in a non-root module. Terraform has always
    ignored such declarations, but previously did so silently. This is a warning rather than an error only because it is
    sometimes convenient to temporarily use a root module as if it were a child module in order to test or debug its behavior
    separately from its main backend. (#26954)
  * config: Removed warning about interpolation-only expressions being deprecated, because `terraform fmt` now automatically
    fixes most cases that the warning would previously highlight. We still recommend using simpler expressions where possible,
    but the deprecation warning had caused a common confusion in the community that the interpolation syntax is _always_
    deprecated, rather than only in the interpolation-only case. (#27835)
  * config: The family of error messages with the summary "Invalid for_each argument" will now include some additional context
    about which external values contributed to the result, making it easier to find the root cause of the error. (#26747)
  * config: Terraform now does text processing using the rules and tables defined for Unicode 13. Previous versions
    were using Unicode 12 rules.
  * `terraform init`: Will now make suggestions for possible providers on some registry failures, and generally remind of
    `required_providers` on all registry failures. (#28014)
  * `terraform init`: Provider installation will now only attempt to rewrite `.terraform.lock.hcl` if it would contain new
    information. (#28230)
  * `terraform init`: New `-lockfile=readonly` option, which suppresses writing changes to the dependency lock file. Any
    installed provider packages must already be recorded in the lock file, or initialization will fail. Use this if you
    are managing the lock file via a separate process and want to avoid adding new checksums for existing dependencies.
    (#27630)
  * `terraform show`: Improved performance when rendering large plans as JSON. (#27998)
  * `terraform validate`: The JSON output now includes a code snippet object for each diagnostic. If present, this object
     contains an excerpt of the source code which triggered the diagnostic, similar to what Terraform would include in
     human-oriented diagnostic messages. (#28057)
  * cli: Terraform now uses UTF-8 and full VT mode even when running on Windows. Previously Terraform was using the "classic"
    Windows console API, which was far more limited in what formatting sequences it supported and which characters it could
    render. (#27487)
  * cli: Improved support for Windows console UI on Windows 10, including bold colors and underline for HCL diagnostics.
    (#26588)
  * cli: Diagnostic messages now have a vertical line along their left margin, which we hope will achieve a better visual
    hierarchy for sighted users and thus make it easier to see where the errors and warnings start and end in relation to
    other content that might be printed alongside. (#27343)
  * cli: Typing an invalid top-level command, like `terraform destory` instead of `destroy`, will now print out a specific
    error message about the command being invalid, rather than just printing out the usual help directory. (#26967)
  * cli: Plugin crashes will now be reported with more detail, pointing out the plugin name and the method call along with
    the stack trace (#26694)
  * cli: Core and Provider logs can now be enabled separately for debugging, using `TF_LOG_CORE` and `TF_LOG_PROVIDER`
    (#26685)
  * backend/azurerm: Support for authenticating as AzureAD users/roles. (#28181)
  * backend/pg: Now allows locking of each workspace separately, whereas before the locks were global across all workspaces.
    (#26924)
  BUG FIXES:
  * config: Fix multiple upstream crashes with optional attributes and sensitive values. (#28116)
  * config: Fix various panics in the experimental `defaults` function. (#27979)
  * config: Fix crash with resources which have sensitive iterable attributes. (#28245)
  * config: Fix crash when referencing resources with sensitive fields that may be unknown. (#28180)
  * `terraform validate`: Validation now ignores providers that lack configuration, which is useful for validating modules
    intended to be called from other modules which therefore don't include their own provider configurations. (#24896)
  * `terraform fmt`: Fix `fmt` output when unwrapping redundant multi-line string interpolations (#28202)
  * `terraform console`: expressions using `path` (`path.root`, `path.module`) now return the same result as they would
     in a configuration (#27263)
  * `terraform show`: Fix crash when rendering JSON plans containing iterable unknown values. (#28253)
  * `terraform show`: fix issue with `child_modules` not properly displaying in certain circumstances. (#27352)
  * `terraform state list`: fix bug where nested modules' resources were missing (#27268)
  * `terraform state mv`: fix display names in errors and improve error when failing to target a whole resource (#27482)
  * `terraform taint`: show resource name in -allow-missing warning (#27501)
  * `terraform untaint`: show resource name in -allow-missing warning (#27502)
  * cli: All commands will now exit with an error if unable to read input at an interactive prompt. For example, this
    may happen when running in a non-interactive environment but without `-input=false`. Previously Terraform would
    behave as if the user entered an empty string, which often led to confusing results. (#26509)
  * cli: `TF_LOG` levels other than `trace` will now work reliably. (#26632)
  * core: Fix crash when trying to create a destroy plan with `-refresh=false`. (#28272)
  * core: Extend the Terraform plan file format to include information about sensitivity and required-replace. This
    ensures that the output of `terraform show saved.tfplan` matches `terraform plan`, and sensitive values are
    elided. (#28201)
  * core: Ensure that stored dependencies are retained when a resource is removed entirely from the configuration,
    and `create_before_destroy` ordering is preserved. (#28228)
  * core: Resources removed from the configuration will now be destroyed before their dependencies are updated. (#28165)
  * core: Refresh data sources while creating a destroy plan, in case their results are important for destroy operations.
    (#27408)
  * core: Fix missing deposed object IDs in apply logs (#27796)
  * backend/azurerm: Fix nil pointer crashes with some state operations. (#28181)
  * backend/azure: Fix interactions between state reading, state creating, and locking. (#26561)
  EXPERIMENTS:
  * `provider_sensitive_attrs`: This experiment has now concluded, and its functionality is now on by default. If
    you were previously participating in this experiment then you can remove the experiment opt-in with no other
    necessary configuration changes.
  * There is now a `terraform test` command, which is currently an experimental feature serving as part of [the Module
    Testing Experiment](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/modules/testing-experiment.html). 
- from version 0.14.11
  ENHANCEMENTS:
  * cli: Update the HashiCorp public key (#28503)
- Enable go_modules service in _service file
- Switch compression to gz in _service file
  * Required for go_modules service to work

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Apr 10 23:31:57 UTC 2021 - Pau Garcia Quiles <pau.garcia@suse.com>

- Update to 0.14.10 :
  ENHANCEMENTS:
  * cli: Emit an "already installed" event when a provider is found already 
    installed (#27722)
  * provisioner/remote-exec: Can now run in a mode that expects the remote 
    system to be running Windows and excuting commands using the Windows 
    command interpreter, rather than a Unix-style shell. Specify the 
    target_platform as "windows" in the connection block. (#26865)
  ENHANCEMENTS:
  * backend/s3: Add support for AWS Single-Sign On (SSO) cached credentials 
    (#27620)
  * config: Terraform now does text processing using the rules and tables 
    defined for Unicode 13. Previous versions were using Unicode 12 rules 
    (#28034)
  BUG FIXES:
  * cli: Rerunning init will reuse installed providers rather than fetching 
    the provider again (#27582)
  * config: Fix panic when applying a config using sensitive values in some 
    block sets (#27635)
  * core: Fix "Invalid planned change" error when planning tainted resource 
    which no longer exists (#27563)
  * core: Fix panic when refreshing data source which contains sensitive 
    values (#27567)
  * core: Fix init with broken link in plugin_cache_dir (#27447)
  * core: Prevent evaluation of removed data source instances during plan 
    (#27621)
  * core: Don't plan changes for outputs that remain null (#27512)
  * cli: Fix show -json not outputting the full module tree when some child 
    modules have no resources (#27352)
  * cli: Fix excessively slow rendering of very large multi-line string 
    outputs (#27746)
  * cli: Fix missing provider requirements in JSON plan when specified using 
    required_providers instead of provider config (#27697)
  * config: Update HCL package to fix panics when indexing using sensitive 
    values (#28034)
  * core: Fix error when using sensitive values in provisioner configuration 
    (#27819)

  * backend/remote: Fix non-functional -lock-timeout argument when using 
    the remote backend with local operations (#27845)
  * backend/remote: Fix error when migrating existing state to a new 
    workspace on Terraform Cloud/Enterprise. (#28093)
  * cli: Only rewrite provider locks file if its contents has changed. (#28230)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan 26 07:42:30 UTC 2021 - Paolo Stivanin <info@paolostivanin.com>

- Update to 0.14.5 :
  NEW FEATURES:
  * terraform now supports marking input variables as sensitive, and
    will propagate that sensitivity through expressions that derive
    from sensitive input variables.
  * terraform init will now generate a lock file in the configuration directory
    which you can check in to your version control so that Terraform can make
    the same version selections in future. (#26524)
  * if you wish to retain the previous behavior of always taking
    the newest version allowed by the version constraints on each install,
    you can run terraform init -upgrade to see that behavior.
  * terraform will now support reading and writing all compatible state files,
    even from future versions of Terraform. This means that users of
    Terraform 0.14.0 will be able to share state files with future Terraform
    versions until a new state file format version is needed.
  ENHANCEMENTS:
  * config: Added sensitive argument for variable blocks, which supresses
    output where that variable is used (#26183)
  * config: Added alltrue and anytrue functions, which serve as a sort of
    dynamic version of the && and || or operators, respectively.
    These are intended to allow evaluating boolean conditions, such as in variable
    validation blocks, across all of the items in a collection using for expressions.
  * config: New functions textencodebase64 and textdecodebase64 for encoding text
    in various character encodings other than UTF-8. (#25470)
  * terraform plan and terraform apply: Added an experimental concise diff renderer.
    By default, Terraform plans now hide most unchanged fields, only displaying
    the most relevant changes and some identifying context. This experiment can be disabled
    by setting a TF_X_CONCISE_DIFF environment variable to 0.
  * config: ignore_changes can now apply to map keys that are not
    listed in the configuration
  * terraform console: Now has distinct rendering of lists, sets, and tuples,
    and correctly renders objects with null attribute values. Multi-line strings
    are rendered using the "heredoc" syntax. (#26189, #27054)
  * terraform login: Added support for OAuth2 application scopes. (#26239)
  * terraform fmt: Will now do some slightly more opinionated normalization behaviors,
    using the documented idiomatic syntax. (#26390)
  * terraform init's provider installation step will now abort promptly if Terraform
    receives an interrupt signal. (#26405)
  * cli: A new global command line option -chdir=..., placed before the selected subcommand,
    instructs Terraform to switch to a different working directory before executing the subcommand.
    This is similar to switching to a new directory with cd before running Terraform,
    but it avoids changing the state of the calling shell. (#26087)
  * cli: help text is been reorganized to emphasize the main commands and improve consistency
  * cli: Ensure that provider requirements are met by the locked dependencies for every command.
    This will help catch errors if the configuration has changed since
    the last run of terraform init. (#26761)
  * core: When sensitive values are used as part of provisioner configuration,
    logging is disabled to ensure the values are not displayed to the UI (#26611)
  * core: terraform plan no longer uses a separate refresh phase. Instead, all resources
    are updated on-demand during planning (#26270)
  * modules: Adds support for loading modules with S3 virtual hosted-style access (#26914)
  * backend/consul: Split state into chunks when outgrowing the limit of the Consul KV store.
    This allows storing state larger than the Consul 512KB limit. (#25856)
  * backend/consul: Add force-unlock support to the Consul backend (#25837)
  * backend/gcs: Add service account impersonation to GCS backend (#26837)
  * On Unix-based operating systems other than MacOS, the SSL_CERT_DIR environment variable
    can now be a colon-separated list of multiple certificate search paths. (#26357)
  BUG FIXES:
  * cli: Fix formatting of long integers in outputs and console (#27479)
  * cli: Fix redundant check of remote workspace version for local operations (#27498)
  * cli: Fix missing check of remote workspace version for state migration (#27556)
  * cli: Fix world-writable permissions on dependency lock file (#27205)
  * backend/remote: Disable remote Terraform workspace version check when the remote workspace
    is in local operations mode ([#27407])
  * core: Fix panic when using sensitive values as arguments to data sources ([#27335])
  * core: Fix panic when using sensitive values as count arguments on validate ([#27410])
  * core: Fix panic when passing sensitive values to module input variables which have
    custom variable validation ([#27412])
  * dependencies: Upgrade HCL to v2.8.2, fixing several bugs with sensitive values ([#27420])
  * config: Fix anytrue and alltrue functions when called with values
    which are not known until apply.
  * config: Fix sum function when called with values which are not known until apply.
    Also allows sum to cope with numbers too large to represent in float64,
    along with correctly handling errors around infinite values. (#27249)
  * config: Fixed panic when referencing sensitive values in resource count expressions 
  * config: Fix incorrect attributes in diagnostics when validating objects (#27010)
  * core: Prevent unexpected updates during plan when multiple sensitive values are involved
  * dependencies: Fix several small bugs related to the use of sensitive values
    with expressions and functions.
  * lang: Fix panic when calling coalescelist with a null argument (#26988)
  * terraform apply: -refresh=false was skipped when running apply directly (#27233)
  * terraform init: setting -get-plugins to false will now cause a warning, as this flag has been
    a no-op since 0.13.0 and usage is better served through using provider_installation blocks
  * terraform init and other commands which interact with the dependency lock file:
    These will now generate a normal error message if the lock file is
    incorrectly a directory, rather than crashing as before.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct  7 10:39:33 UTC 2020 - John Paul Adrian Glaubitz <adrian.glaubitz@suse.com>

- Update to 0.13.4 (bsc#1177421, jsc#ECO-2766, jsc#PM-2215)
  UPGRADE NOTES:
  * The built-in vendor (third-party) provisioners, which include `habitat`, `puppet`,
    `chef`, and `salt-masterless` are now deprecated and will be removed in a future
    version of Terraform.
  * Deprecated interpolation-only expressions are detected in more contexts in addition
    to resources and provider configurations. Module calls, data sources, outputs, and
    locals are now also covered. Terraform also detects interpolation-only expressions
    in complex values such as lists and objects. An expression like `"${foo}"` should
    be rewritten as just `foo`. (#27272) (#26334)
  BUG FIXES:
  * command: Include schemas from required but unused providers in the output of `terraform
    providers schema`. This allows development tools such as the Terraform language server
    to offer autocompletion for the first resource for a given provider. (#26318)
  * core: create_before_destroy status is now updated in the state during refresh (#26343)
  * core: data sources using `depends_on`, either directly or through their modules, are
    no longer are forced to wait until apply by other planned data source reads (#26375)
- from 0.13.3
  BUG FIXES:
  * build: fix crash with terraform binary on openBSD (#26250)
  * core: prevent create_before_destroy cycles by not connecting module close nodes to
    resource instance destroy nodes (#26186)
  * core: fix error where plan action changes from CreateThenDelete to DeleteThenCreate (#26192)
  * core: fix Cycle when create_before_destroy status wasn't checked from state (#26263)
  * core: fix "inconsistent final plan" error when changing the number of referenced
    resources to 0 (#26264)
  * states/remote: fix `state push -force` to work for all backends (#26190)
- from 0.13.2
  NEW FEATURES:
  * **Network-based Mirrors for Provider Installation**: As an addition to the existing capability
    of "mirroring" providers into the local filesystem, a network mirror allows publishing copies
    of providers on an HTTP server and using that as an alternative source for provider packages,
    for situations where directly accessing the origin registries is impossible or undesirable.
    (#25999)
  ENHANCEMENTS:
  * backend/http: add support for configuration by environment variable. (#25439)
  * command: Add support for provider redirects to `0.13upgrade`. If a provider in the Terraform
    Registry has moved to a new namespace, the `0.13upgrade` subcommand now detects this and follows
    the redirect where possible. (#26061)
  * command: Improve `init` error diagnostics when encountering what appears to be an in-house
    provider required by a pre-0.13 state file. Terraform will now display suggested `terraform state
    replace-provider` commands which will fix this specific problem. (#26066)
  BUG FIXES:
  * command: Warn instead of error when the `output` subcommand with no arguments results in no outputs.
    This aligns the UI to match the 0 exit code in this situation, which is notable but not necessarily
    an error. (#26036)
  * terraform: Fix crashing bug when reading data sources during plan with blocks backed by objects,
    not collections (#26028)
  * terraform: Fix bug where variables values were asked for twice on the command line and provider
    input values were asked for but not saved (#26063)
- from 0.13.1
  ENHANCEMENTS:
  * config: `cidrsubnet` and `cidrhost` now support address extensions of more than 32 bits (#25517)
  * cli: The directories that Terraform searches by default for provider plugins can now be symlinks
    to directories elsewhere. (This applies only to the top-level directory, not to nested directories
    inside it.) (#25692)
  * backend/s3: simplified mock handling and assume role testing (#25903)
  * backend/s3: support for appending data to the User-Agent request header with the TF_APPEND_USER_AGENT
    environment variable (#25903)
  BUG FIXES:
  * config: Override files containing `module` blocks can now override the special `providers` argument. (#25496)
  * cli: The state lock will now be unlocked consistently across both the local and remote backends in the
    `terraform console` and `terraform import` commands. (#25454)
  * cli: The `-target` option to `terraform plan` and `terraform apply` now correctly handles addresses
    containing module instance indexes. (#25760)
  * cli: `terraform state mv` can now move the last resource from a module without panicking. (#25523)
  * cli: If the output of `terraform version` contains an outdated version notice, this is now printed
    after the version number and not before. (#25811)
  * command: Prevent creation of workspaces with invalid names via the `TF_WORKSPACE` environment variable,
    and allow any existing invalid workspaces to be deleted. (#25262)
  * command: Fix error when multiple `-no-color` flags are set on the command line. (#25847)
  * command: Fix backend config override validation, allowing the use of `-backend-config` override files
    with the enhanced remote backend. (#25960)
  * core: State snapshots now use a consistent ordering for resources that have the same name across different
    modules. Previously the ordering was undefined. (#25498)
  * core: A `dynamic` block producing an unknown number of blocks will no longer incorrectly produce the error
    "Provider produced inconsistent final plan" when the block type is backed by a set of objects. (#25662)
  * core: Terraform will now silently drop attributes that appear in the state but are not present in the
    corresponding resource type schema, on the assumption that those attributes existed in a previous version
    of the provider and have now been removed. (#25779)
  * core: The state upgrade logic for handling unqualified provider addresses from Terraform v0.11 and earlier
    will no longer panic when it encounters references to the built-in `terraform` provider. (#25861)
  * internal: Clean up provider package download temporary files after installing. (#25990)
  * terraform: Evaluate module call arguments for `terraform import` even if defaults are given for input
    variables (#25890)
  * terraform: Fix misleading Terraform `required_version` constraint diagnostics when multiple `required_version`
    settings exist in a single module (#25898)
- from 0.13.0
  NEW FEATURES:
  * **`count` and `for_each` for modules**: Similar to the arguments of the same name in `resource` and `data`
    blocks, these create multiple instances of a module from a single `module` block. (#24461)
  * **`depends_on` for modules**: Modules can now use the `depends_on` argument to ensure that all module
    resource changes will be applied after any changes to the `depends_on` targets have been applied. (#25005)
  * **Automatic installation of third-party providers**: Terraform now supports a decentralized namespace for
    providers, allowing for automatic installation of community providers from third-party namespaces in the
    public registry and from private registries. (More details will be added about this prior to release.)
  * **Custom validation rules for input variables**: A new `validation` block type inside `variable` blocks
    allows module authors to define validation rules at the public interface into a module, so that errors in
    the calling configuration can be reported in the caller's context rather than inside the implementation
    details of the module. (#25054)
  * **New Kubernetes remote state storage backend**: This backend stores state snapshots as Kubernetes secrets.
    (#19525)
  BREAKING CHANGES:
  * As part of introducing a new heirarchical namespace for providers, Terraform now requires an explicit `source`
    specification for any provider that is not in the "hashicorp" namespace in the main public registry. (#24477)
    For more information, including information on the automatic upgrade process, refer to the v0.13 upgrade guide.
  * `terraform import`: the previously-deprecated `-provider` option is now removed. (#24090)
    To specify a non-default provider configuration for import, add the `provider` meta-argument to the
    target `resource` block.
  * config: Inside `provisioner` blocks that have `when = destroy` set, and inside any `connection` blocks that are
    used by such `provisioner` blocks, it is no longer valid to refer to any objects other than `self`, `count`, or
    `each`. (This was previously deprecated in a v0.12 minor release.) (#24083)
    If you are using `null_resource` to define provisioners not attached to a real resource, include any values your
    provisioners need in the `triggers` map and change the provisioner configuration to refer to those values
    via `self.triggers`.
  * configs: At most one `terraform` `required_providers` block is permitted per module (#24763)
    If you previously had multiple `required_providers` blocks in the same module, consolidate their requirements
    together into a single block.
  * The official MacOS builds of Terraform CLI are no longer compatible with Mac OS 10.10 Yosemite; Terraform now
    requires at least Mac OS 10.11 El Capitan.
    Terraform 0.13 is the last major release that will support 10.11 El Capitan, so if you are upgrading your OS
    we recommend upgrading to Mac OS 10.12 Sierra or later.
  * The official FreeBSD builds of Terraform CLI are no longer compatible with FreeBSD 10.x, which has reached
    end-of-life. Terraform now requires FreeBSD 11.2 or later.
  * backend/oss: The TableStore schema now requires a primary key named `LockID` of type `String`. (#24149)
  * backend/s3: The previously-deprecated `lock_table`, `skip_get_ec2_platforms`, and `skip_requesting_account_id`
    arguments are now removed. (#25134)
  * backend/s3: The credential source preference order now considers EC2 instance profile credentials as lower
    priority than shared configuration, web identity, and ECS role credentials. (#25134)
  * backend/s3: The `AWS_METADATA_TIMEOUT` environment variable is no longer used. The timeout is now fixed at one
    second with two retries. (#25134)
  NOTES:
  * The `terraform plan` and `terraform apply` commands will now detect and report changes to root module outputs
    as needing to be applied even if there are no resource changes in the plan.
    This is an improvement in behavior for most users, since it will now be possible to change `output` blocks and
    use `terraform apply` to apply those changes.
    If you have a configuration where a root module output value is changing for every plan (for example, by referring
    to an unstable data source), you will need to remove or change that output value in order to allow convergence on
    an empty plan. Otherwise, each new plan will propose more changes.
  * Terraform CLI now supports TLS 1.3 and supports Ed25519 certificates when making outgoing connections to
    remote TLS servers.
    While both of these changes are backwards compatible in principle, certain legacy TLS server implementations can
    reportedly encounter problems when attempting to negotiate TLS 1.3. (These changes affects only requests made by
    Terraform CLI itself, such as to module registries or backends. Provider plugins have separate TLS implementations
    that will gain these features on a separate release schedule.)
  * On Unix systems where `use-vc` is set in `resolv.conf`, Terraform will now use TCP for DNS resolution.
    We don't expect this to cause any problem for most users, but if you find you are seeing DNS resolution failures
    after upgrading please verify that you can either reach your configured nameservers using TCP or that your resolver
    configuration does not include the `use-vc` directive.
  * The `terraform 0.12upgrade` command is no longer available. (#24403)
    To upgrade from Terraform v0.11, first upgrade to the latest v0.12 release and then upgrade to v0.13 from there.
  ENHANCEMENTS:
  * config: `templatefile` function will now return a helpful error message if a given variable has an invalid name,
    rather than relying on a syntax error in the template parsing itself. (#24184)
  * config: The configuration language now uses Unicode 12.0 character tables for certain Unicode-version-sensitive
    operations on strings, such as the `upper` and `lower` functions. Those working with strings containing new characters
    introduced since Unicode 9.0 may see small differences in behavior as a result of these table updates.
  * config: The new `sum` function takes a list or set of numbers and returns the sum of all elements. (#24666)
  * config: Modules authored by the same vendor as the main provider they use can now pass metadata to the provider to
    allow for instrumentation and analytics. (#22583)
  * cli: The `terraform plan` and `terraform apply` commands now recognize changes to root module outputs as side-effects
    to be approved and applied. This means you can apply root module output changes using the normal plan and apply workflow.
    (#25047)
    * cli: When installing providers from the Terraform Registry, Terraform will verify the trust signature for partner
    providers, and allow for self-signed community providers. (#24617)
  * cli: `terraform init` will display detailed trust signature information when installing providers from the Terraform
    Registry and other provider registries. (#24932)
  * cli: It is now possible to optionally specify explicitly which installation methods can be used for different providers
    in the CLI configuration, such as forcing a particular provider to be loaded from a particular directory on local disk
    instead of consulting its origin provider registry. (#24728)
  * cli: The new `terraform state replace-provider` subcommand allows changing the selected provider for existing resource
    instances in the Terraform state. (#24523)
  * cli: The new `terraform providers mirror` subcommand can automatically construct or update a local filesystem mirror
    directory containing the providers required for the current configuration. (#25084)
  * cli: `terraform version -json` now produces machine-readable version information. (#25252)
  * cli: `terraform import` can now work with provider configurations containing references to other objects, as long as the
    data in question is already known in the current state. (#25420)
  * cli: The `terraform state rm` command will now exit with status code 1 if the given resource address does not match any
    resource instances. (#22300)
  * cli: The `terraform login` command now requires the full word "yes" to confirm, rather than just "y",
    for consistency with Terraform's other interactive prompts. (#25379)
  * core: Several of Terraform's graph operations are now better optimized to support configurations with highly-connected
    graphs. (#23811)
  * backend/remote: Now supports `terraform state push -force`. (#24696)
  * backend/remote: Can now accept `-target` options when creating a plan using _remote operations_, if
    supported by the target server. (Server-side support for this in Terraform Cloud and Terraform Enterprise
    will follow in forthcoming releases of each.) (#24834)
  * backend/azurerm: Now uses the Giovanni Storage SDK to communicate with Azure. (#24669)
  * backend/s3: The backend will now always consult the shared configuration file, even if the `AWS_SDK_LOAD_CONFIG`
    environment variable isn't set. That environment variable is now ignored. (#25134)
  * backend/s3: Region validation now automatically supports the new `af-south-1`
    (Africa (Cape Town)) region. (#24744)
    For AWS operations to work in the new region, you must explicitly enable it as described in AWS General
    Reference: Enabling a Region. If you haven't enabled the region, the Terraform S3 Backend will
    return `InvalidClientTokenId` errors during credential validation.
  * backend/s3: A `~/` prefix in the `shared_credentials_file` argument is now expanded to
    the current user's home directory. (#25134)
  * backend/s3: The backend has a number of new options for customizing the "assume role" behavior,
    including controlling the lifetime and access policy of temporary credentials. (#25134)
  * backend/swift: The authentication options match those of the OpenStack provider. (#23510)
  BUG FIXES:
  * config: The `jsonencode` function can now correctly encode a single null value as
    the JSON expression `null`. (#25078)
  * config: The `map` function no longer crashes when incorrectly given a non-string key. (#24277)
  * config: The `substr` function now correctly returns a zero-length string when given a
    length of zero, rather than ignoring that argument entirely. (#24318)
  * config: `ceil(1/0)` and `floor(1/0)` (that is, an infinity as an argument) now return another
    infinity with the same sign, rather than just a large integer. (#21463)
  * config: The `rsadecrypt` function now supports the OpenSSH RSA key format. (#25112)
  * config: The `merge` function now returns more precise type information, making it usable for
    values passed to `for_each`, and will no longer crash if all of the given maps are empty. (#24032), (#25303)
  * vendor: The various set-manipulation functions, like `setunion`, will no longer
    panic if given an unknown set value (#25318)
  * config: Fixed a crash with incorrect syntax in `.tf.json` and `.tfvars.json` files. (#24650)
  * config: The function argument expansion syntax `...` no longer incorrectly fails with "Invalid
    expanding argument value" in situations where the expanding argument's type will not be known
    until the apply phase. (#25216)
  * config: Variable `validation` block error message checks no longer fail when non-ASCII
    characters are present. (#25144)
  * cli: The `terraform plan` command (and the implied plan run by `terraform apply` with no arguments)
    will now print any warnings that were generated even if there are no changes to be made. (#24095)
  * cli: `terraform state mv` now correctly records the resource's use of either `count` or `for_each`
    based on the given target address. (#24254)
  * cli: When using the `TF_CLI_CONFIG_FILE` environment variable to override where Terraform looks
    for CLI configuration, Terraform will now ignore the default CLI configuration directory as well
    as the default CLI configuration file. (#24728)
  * cli: The `terraform login` command in OAuth2 mode now implements the PKCE OAuth 2 extension more
    correctly. Previously it was not compliant with all of the details of the specification. (#24858)
  * cli: Fixed a potential crash when the `HOME` environment variable isn't set, causing the native
    service credentials store to be `nil`. (#25110)
  * command/fmt: Error messages will now include source code snippets where possible. (#24471)
  * command/apply: `terraform apply` will no longer silently exit when given an absolute
    path to a saved plan file on Windows. (#25233)
  * command/init: `terraform init` will now produce an explicit error message if given a non-directory
    path for its configuration directory argument, and if a `-backend-config` file has a syntax error.
    Previously these were silently ignored. (#25300), (#25411)
  * command/console:  (#25442)
  * command/import: The `import` command will now properly attach the configured provider for the target
    resource based on the configuration, making the `-provider` command line option unnecessary. (#22862)
  * command/import: The `-allow-missing-config` option now works correctly. It was inadvertently
    disabled as part of v0.12 refactoring. (#25352)
  * command/show: Resource addresses are now consistently formatted between the plan and prior state
    in the `-json` output. (#24256)
  * core: Fixed a crash related to an unsafe concurrent read and write of a map data structure. (#24599)
  * core: Instances are now destroyed only using their stored state, without re-evaluating configuration. This
    avoids a number of dependency cycle problems when "delete" actions are included in a plan. (#24083)
  * provider/terraform: The `terraform_remote_state` data source will no longer attempt to "configure" the
    selected backend during validation, which means backends will not try to perform remote actions such as
    verifying credentials during `terraform validate`. Local validation still applies in all cases, and the
    configuration step will still occur prior to actually reading the remote state in a normal plan/apply
    operation. (#24887)
  * backend/remote: Backend will no longer crash if the user cancels backend initialization at an inopportune
    time, or if there is a connection error. (#25135) (#25341)
  * backend/azurerm: The backend will now create a Azure storage snapshot of the previous Terraform
    state snapshot before writing a new one. (#24069)
  * backend/s3: Various other minor authentication-related fixes previously made in the AWS provider. (#25134)
  * backend/oss: Now allows locking of multiple different state files. (#24149)
  * provisioner/remote-exec: The provisioner will now return an explicit error if the `host` connection argument
    is an empty string. Previously it would repeatedly attempt to resolve an empty hostname until timeout. (#24080)
  * provisioner/chef: The provisioner will now gracefully handle non-failure (RFC062) exit codes returned from Chef. (#19155)
  * provisioner/habitat: The provisioner will no longer generate `user.toml` with world-readable permissions. (#24321)
  * communicator/winrm: Support a connection timeout for WinRM `connection` blocks. Previously this
    argument worked for SSH only. (#25350)
  EXPERIMENTS:
  * This release concludes the `variable_validation` experiment that was started in Terraform v0.12.20. If you were
    participating in the experiment, you should remove the experiment opt-in from your configuration as part of upgrading
    to Terraform 0.13. The experiment received only feedback that can be addressed with backward-compatible future
    enhancements, so we've included it into this release as stable with no changes to its original design so far. We'll
    consider additional features related to custom validation in future releases after seeing how it's used in
    real-world modules.

Wed Feb 19 07:05:47 UTC 2020 - Petr Cervinka <petr@cervinka.net>

- Run spec-cleaner
- Update to 0.12.20
  ENHANCEMENTS:
   * config: New built-in functions `try` and `can` are intended to ease working with data structures whose shape isn't known statically. ([#23794](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/23794))
   * config: New, optional syntax for [`required_providers`](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/terraform.html#specifying-required-provider-versions) setting in `terraform` blocks. This is not intended for general use yet but will support upcoming enhancements. [[#23843](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/23843)] 

  BUG FIXES:
   * command/show: Fix an issue with show and aliased providers ([#23848](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/23848))
   * core: Always clean up empty resources before empty modules ([#23822](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/23822))
   * internal/modsdir/manifest: Fix CLI issue with Windows machines ([#23865](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/23865))
  EXPERIMENTS:
   * This release includes an _opt-in experiment_ for [custom validation rules on module variables](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/variables.html#custom-validation-rules).
     The feature is not yet finalized and is subject to breaking changes even in minor releases, but we're introducing it here in order to solicit feedback from module developers about which use-cases it is meeting, any use-cases it _isn't_ meeting, and any situations where things feel harder to express than they might be.
     Due to the experimental nature of this feature, we do not recommend using it in "production" modules yet and we require an explicit [experimental feature opt-in](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/terraform.html#experimental-language-features) of `variable_validation`. Depending on what feedback we receive, the design of this experimental feature may change significantly in future versions without an automatic upgrade path.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan 15 11:18:20 UTC 2020 - Jean-Philippe Evrard <jevrard@suse.com>

- Update to 0.12.19
    ENHANCEMENTS:
      command/init: Cache Terraform Registry metadata responses when handling multiple references to the same module. (#23727)
      command/state-mv: Detect and remove references elsewhere in the state to the source address in a terraform state mv operation. This does not affect any current operations but will cause the resulting state snapshot to be different than before, and a future version of Terraform may make use of this additional precision. (#23791)
    BUG FIXES:
      command/init: Fix an issue with via an update to go-getter where modules would fail to download from the registry (#23792)
      command/init: use backend config from state when -backend=false is used during init. (#23802)
      core: Do not evaluate unused config values, which may not be valid during destroy (#23717)
      core: Better error handling for an odd "should never happen" situation regarding the restoration of a deposed instance during a create_before_destroy replace action. While this does not yet fix the situation (it can still happen), it now has a specialized error message to hopefully help gather some more information about the root cause in future reports. (#23718)
      core: Prevent insertion of default providers when resources are removed from the config. (#23696)
      core: Detect and handle dependencies implied by references in a connection block directly within a resource block. (#23663)
      communicator/ssh: Fix deadlock when SSH agent forwarding fails. (#23661)
- Update to 0.12.18
    NOTES:
      cli: Our darwin releases for this version and up will be signed and notarized according to Apple's requirements.
      Prior to this release, MacOS 10.15+ users attempting to run our software reported seeing the error: "'terraform' cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified." This error affected all MacOS 10.15+ users who downloaded our software directly via web browsers, and was caused by changes to Apple's third-party software requirements.
      Our recommended approach to install and interact with the Terraform CLI can be found here.
      MacOS 10.15+ users should plan to upgrade to 0.12.18+.
    UPGRADE NOTES:
      Inside provisioner blocks that have when = destroy set, and inside any connection blocks that are used by such provisioner blocks, it is now deprecated to refer to any objects other than self, count, and each.
      Terraform has historically allowed this but doing so tends to cause downstream problems with dependency cycles or incorrect destroy ordering because it causes the destroy phase of one resource to depend on the existing state of another. Although this is currently only a warning, we strongly suggest seeking alternative approaches for existing configurations that are hitting this warning in order to avoid the risk of later problems should you need to replace or destroy the related resources.
      This deprecation warning will be promoted to an error in a future release.
    ENHANCEMENTS:
      provisioners: Warn about the deprecation of non-self references in destroy-time provisioners, both to allow preparation for this later becoming an error and also as an extra hint for the "Cycle" errors that commonly arise when such references are used. (#23559)
      cli: The terraform plan and terraform apply commands (and some others) now accept the additional option -compact-warnings. If set, and if Terraform produces warnings that are not also accompanied by errors, then the warnings will be presented in the output in a compact form that includes only the summary information, thus providing a compromise to avoid warnings overwhelming the output if you are not yet ready to resolve them. (#23632)
    BUG FIXES:
      backend/s3: Fix for users with >1000 workspaces (#22963)
      cli: Allow moving indexed resource instances to new addresses that that don't yet exist in state (#23582)
      cli: Improved heuristics for log level filtering with the TF_LOG environment variable, although it is still not 100% reliable for levels other than TRACE due to limitations of Terraform's internal logging infrastructure. Because of that, levels other than TRACE will now cause the logs to begin with a warning about potential filtering inaccuracy. (#23577)
      command/show: Fix panic on show plan (#23581)
      config: Fixed referencing errors generally involving for_each (#23475)
      provisioners: The built-in provisioners (local-exec, remote-exec, file, etc) will no longer fail when the TF_CLI_ARGS environment variable is set. (#17400)

- Update to 0.12.17
  SECURITY NOTES:
   * If you are using the Azure remote state backend and you are using a SAS Token for authentication, please refer to [the Azure remote state backend security advisory](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/security/advisories/GHSA-4rvg-555h-r626).
     Prior versions of the backend may have transmitted your state to the storage service using cleartext HTTP unless you specifically requested HTTPS when generating your SAS Token. This does not affect any other backends, and does not affect the Azure backend when using other authentication mechanisms.
  NEW FEATURES:
   * lang/funcs: Add `trim*` functions
  ENHANCEMENTS:
   * cli: Terraform will now consolidate many warnings with the same summary text into fewer warning items, in order to avoid excessive amounts of warnings making it hard to read other output from Terraform commands. ([#23425](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/23425))
   * core: The upgrade logic for moving from the Terraform 0.11 to the Terraform 0.12 state snapshot format (internally, format version 3 to version 4) will now tolerate and ignore dependencies with invalid addresses, which tend to be left behind when following the `terraform 0.11checklist` directive to rename resources whose names start with digits prior to upgrading to Terraform 0.12. This should allow upgrading the state for a configuration that in the past had digit-prefixed resource names, once those names have been fixed in the configuration and state using the instructions given by `terraform 0.11checklist` in Terraform 0.11.14. ([#23443](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/23443))
  BUG FIXES:
   * command/jsonplan, command/jsonstate: fix panic with null values ([#23492](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/23492))
   * backend/azure: Use HTTPS to talk to the storage API, even if using a SAS token that does not require it. ([#23496](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/23496))

Fri Nov 15 08:00:51 UTC 2019 - Petr Cervinka <petr@cervinka.net>

- Update to 0.12.15
  BUG FIXES:
  * various commands: Fixed errant error "Initialization required. Please see the error message above." ([#23383](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/23383))
    The error was produced on some of Terraform's subcommands (in particular `terraform show` and `terraform output`, but possibly others) if a warning was emitted during configuration loading and if a `backend` block was present. This issue has been present since v0.12.0 for any configuration that produces configuration-related deprecation warnings, but it became more visible in v0.12.14 due to the addition of several more situations that could produce warnings.
- Changes of version 0.12.14
  UPGRADE NOTES:
   * Terraform v0.12.0 included several changes to the Terraform language involving making expressions, type constraints, keywords, and references first-class in the language syntax, removing the need for placing thee items either in quoted strings or in interpolation syntax. Terraform v0.11 required these items to be quoted because the underlying language could not represent them any other way, while Terraform v0.12 expects them to be unquoted in order to improve readability.
    We have been accepting both forms for backward-compatibility with existing configurations and examples since the inititial v0.12.0 release. Having maintained compatibility for both forms for several versions we are now beginning the deprecation cycle for the old usage by having Terraform emit deprecation warnings.
    Terraform will still accept the older forms in spite of these warnings, so no immediate action is required. If your modules are targeting Terraform v0.12.0 and later exclusively, you can silence the warnings by removing the quotes, as directed in the warning message. In a future major version of Terraform, some of these warnings will be elevated to be errors.
    The summary of the warning for these situations will be one of the following:
    * **Interpolation-only expressions are deprecated:** an expression like `"${foo}"` should be rewritten as just `foo`.
    * **Quoted type constraints are deprecated:** In a `variable` block, a type constraint `"map"` should be written as `map(string)`, `"list"` as `list(string)`, and `"string"` as just `string`.
    * **Quoted keywords are deprecated:** In certain contexts that expect special keywords, such as `when` in `provisioner` blocks, the keyword should be unquoted.
    * **Quoted references are deprecated:** In the `depends_on` and `ignore_changes` meta-arguments, quoted references like `"aws_instance.foo"` should be rewritten without the quotes, e.g. as `aws_instance.foo`.
    The above changes are made automatically by the upgrade tool for users who are [upgrading from Terraform 0.11](https://www.terraform.io/upgrade-guides/index.html). These warnings are intended to help those who are using Terraform for the first time at Terraform 0.12 but who may have found examples online that are written for older versions of Terraform, in order to guide towards the modern Terraform style.
   * The `terraform output` command would formerly treat no outputs at all as an error, exiting with a non-zero status. Since it's expected for some root modules to have no outputs, the command now returns with success status zero in this situation, but still returns the error on stderr as a compromise to provide an explanation for why nothing is being shown.
  ENHANCEMENTS:
   * config: Redundant interpolation syntax for attribute values and legacy (0.11-style) variable type constrants will now emit deprecation warnings. ([#23348](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/23348))
   * config: Keywords and references in `depends_on`, `ignore_changes`, and in provisioner `when` and `on_failure` will now emit deprecation warnings. ([#23329](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/23329))
   * command/output: Now treats no defined outputs as a success case rather than an error case, returning exit status zero instead of non-zero. ([#23008](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/23008)] [[#21136](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/21136))
   * backend/artifactory: Will now honor the `HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variables when appropriate, to allow sending requests to the Artifactory endpoints via a proxy. ([#18629](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/18629))
  BUG FIXES:
   * backend/remote: Filter environment variables when loading context for remote backend ([#23283](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/23283))
   * command/plan: Previously certain changes to lists would cause the list diff in the plan output to miss items. Now `terraform plan` will show those items as expected. ([#22695](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/22695))
   * command/show: When showing a saved plan file not in JSON mode, use the same presentation as `terraform plan` itself would've used. ([#23292](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/23292))
   * command/force-unlock: Return an explicit error when the local-filesystem lock implementation receives the wrong lock id. Previously it was possible to see either an incorrect error or no error at all in that case. ([#23336](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/23336))
   * core: Store absolute instance dependencies in state to allow for proper destroy ordering ([#23252](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/23252))
   * core: Ensure tainted status is maintained when a destroy operation fails ([#23304](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/23304))
   * config: `transpose` function will no longer panic when it should produce an empty map as its result. ([#23321](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/23321))
   * cli: When running Terraform as a sub-process of itself, we will no longer produce errant prefixes on the console output. While we don't generally recommend using Terraform recursively like this, it was behaving in this strange way due to an implementation detail of how Terraform captures "panic" crashes from the Go runtime, and that subsystem is now updated to avoid that strange behavior. ([#23281](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/23281))
   * provisioners: Sanitize output to filter invalid utf8 sequences ([#23302](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/23302))

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov 13 16:27:07 UTC 2019 - moio@suse.com

- Update to 0.12.13
  UPGRADE NOTES:
    * Remote backend local-only operations:** Previously the remote backend was not correctly handling variables marked as "HCL" in the remote workspace when running local-only operations like `terraform import`, instead interpreting them as literal strings as described in [#23228](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/23228).

    That behavior is now corrected in this release, but in the unlikely event that an existing remote workspace contains a variable marked as "HCL" whose value is not valid HCL syntax these local-only commands will now fail with a syntax error where previously the value would not have been parsed at all and so an operation not relying on that value may have succeeded in spite of the problem. If you see an error like "Invalid expression for var.example" on local-only commands after upgrading, ensure that the remotely-stored value for the given variable uses correct HCL value syntax.
    
    This _does not_ affect true remote operations like `terraform plan` and `terraform apply`, because the processing of variables for those always happens in the remote system.
  BUG FIXES:
    * config: Fix regression where self wasn't properly evaluated when using for_each ([#23215](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/23215))
    * config: dotfiles are no longer excluded when copying existing modules; previously, any dotfile/dir was excluded in this copy, but this change makes the local copy behavior match go-getter behavior ([#22946](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/22946))
    * core: Ensure create_before_destroy ordering is enforced with dependencies between modules ([#22937](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/22937))
    * core: Fix some destroy-time cycles due to unnecessary edges in the graph, and remove unused resource nodes ([#22976](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/22976))
    * backend/remote: Correctly handle remotely-stored variables that are marked as "HCL" when running local-only operations like `terraform import`. Previously they would produce a type mismatch error, due to misinterpreting them as literal strings. ([#23229](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/23229)) 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 21 06:32:44 UTC 2019 - Petr Cervinka <pcervinka@suse.com>

- Update to 0.12.12
  BUG FIXES:
   * backend/remote: Don't do local validation of whether variables are set prior to submitting, because only the remote system knows the full set of configured stored variables and environment variables that might contribute. This avoids erroneous error messages about unset required variables for remote runs when those variables will be set by stored variables in the remote workspace. ([#23122](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/23122))
- Changes of version  0.12.11
  ENHANCEMENTS:
   * backend/s3: Support `role_arn` in AWS configuration files ([#22994](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/22994))
   * backend/remote: Remote backend will now ignore all .terraform/ (exclusive of .terraform/modules) and .git/ directories for uploads during remote plans/applies. You can exclude files from upload to TFC by adding a .terraformignore file to your configuration directory, more details at https://www.terraform.io/docs/backends/types/remote.html ([#23105](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/23105))
  BUG FIXES:
   * config: Clean up orphan modules in the presence of -target ([#21313](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/21313))
   * config: Always evaluate whole resources rather than instances in expressions, so that invalid instance indexes can return a useful error rather than unknown ([#22846](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/22846))
   * command/jsonplan: fix bug with missing nested modules `planned_values` output ([#23092](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/23092))
   * command/show: Fix panic when the only resource instance is deposed ([#23027](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/23027))
   * commands: When required root module variables are not provided and interactive input is disabled (`-input=false`), produce a proper "variable not defined" error rather than falling through to an internal assertion failure. ([#23040](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/23040))
   * provisioner/puppet: fix bug when connection type was not set in config ([#23057](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/23057))

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct  8 13:48:41 UTC 2019 - Petr Cervinka <petr@cervinka.net>

- Update to 0.12.10
  ENHANCEMENTS:
   * `terraform plan` and `terraform apply` will now warn when the `-target` option is used, to draw attention to the fact that the result of applying the plan is likely to be incomplete, and to remind to re-run `terraform plan` with no targets afterwards to ensure that the configuration has converged. ([#22783](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/22783))
   * config: New function `parseint` for parsing strings containing digits as integers in various bases. ([#22747](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/22747))
   * config: New function `cidrsubnets`, which is a companion to the existing function `cidrsubnet` which can allocate multiple consecutive subnet prefixes (possibly of different prefix lengths) in a single call. ([#22858](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/22858))
   * backend/google: The GCS backend now supports OAuth2 token authentication. ([#21772](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/21772))
   * provisioner/habitat: Multiple updates and fixes, see PR for details ([#22705](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/22705))
  BUG FIXES:
   * backend/manta: fix panic when `insecure_skip_tls_verify` was not set ([#22918](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/22918))

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 18 06:27:30 UTC 2019 - Petr Cervinka <petr@cervinka.net>

- Update to 0.12.9
  NOTES:
   * core: `ignore_changes` is now processed (in addition to existing behaviors) before the provider plan is run. This means that users may see fewer planned changes when using `ignore_changes`, as before this change, changes to ignored attributes were still being sent to CustomizeDiff in providers (which could mean cascading changes for some resources). This should be indicative that providers are no longer getting changes that were marked as ignored, but if unexpected plans are seen while using `ignore_changes`, investigate the settings in the `ignore_changes` block to ensure the appropriate attributes are set. ([#22520](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/22520))
  ENHANCEMENTS:
   * provisioners/habitat: `accept_license` argument available to automate accepting the EULA, now required by this client ([#22745](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/22745))
   * config: add source addressing to unknown value errors in `for_each` ([#22760](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/22760))
  BUG FIXES:
   * command/console: support -var and -var-file flags ([#22145](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/22145))
   * command/show: Fixed bug with wrong errors being returned or swallowed. ([#22772](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/22772))
   * config: The `cidrhost`, `cidrsubnet`, and `cidrnetmask` functions now behave correctly with IPv6 prefixes that are short enough for the host portion to be greater than 64-bit or 32-bit (depending on the target architecture). ([#22505](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/22505))
   * config: Fixed bug on empty sets with `for_each` ([#22281](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/22281))

   * backend/google: Now using the OAuth2 token endpoint on `googleapis.com` instead of `google.com`. These endpoints are equivalent in functionality but `googleapis.com` hosts are resolvable from private Google Cloud Platform VPCs where other connectivity is restricted. ([#22451](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/22451))

- update to 0.12.6:
  * backend/s3: After this update, the AWS Go SDK will prefer credentials found via the `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable when both the `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable and the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables are statically defined. Previously the SDK would ignore the `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable, if static environment credentials were also specified. This is listed as a bug fix in the AWS Go SDK release notes. ([#22253](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/22253))

  NEW FEATURES:
  * backend/oss: added support for assume role config ([#22186](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/22186))

Tue May 21 06:56:47 UTC 2019 - Petr Cervinka <petr@cervinka.net>

- Update to 0.11.14
  NEW FEATURES:
    * `terraform 0.12checklist` command detects and reports on some preparation steps that will make a subsequent
       Terraform 0.12 upgrade smoother. ([#21241](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/21241))
  IMPROVEMENTS:
    * provider/terraform: The `terraform_remote_state` data source is now able to read outputs from a state snapshot
      created by Terraform 0.12, to provide more flexibility when upgrading individual configurations 
      to Terraform 0.12 in a decomposed environment. ([#21226](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/21226))
    * backend/s3: Support DynamoDB, IAM, and STS endpoint configurations ([#20659](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/20659))
    * backend/s3: Support for AWS regions `eu-north-1` and `us-gov-east-1` ([#20659](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/20659))
    * backend/s3: Enhance retry logic and provide `max_retries` configuration for retry attempts ([#20659](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/20659))
    * backend/s3: Enhance S3 `NoSuchBucket` error to include additional information ([#20659](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/20659))

  BUG FIXES:
    * backend/remote: Fix a backend initialization bug ([#20638](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/20638))
- Update to 0.11.12
  IMPROVEMENTS:
    * The `filemd5`, `filesha1`, etc functions from Terraform v0.12 are backported primarily to allow writing
      modules that can work in both Terraform 0.11 and 0.12, since the `sha1(file("..."))` pattern in 0.12
      works only for files containing valid UTF-8 text; `sha1file("...")` must be used instead.  Both
      forms are equivalent in Terraform 0.11.
    * backend/remote: Retry calls when the remote backend responds with a server error ([#20589](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/20589))

    * backend/remote: Add support for remote state only organizations ([#20007](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/20007))
    * backend/remote: Make sure the correct error is shown when having version incompatibilities ([#20086](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/20086))
  BUG FIXES:
    * backend/remote: Fix an error that prevents checking version constraints ([#19668](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/19668))
    * backend/remote: Compare versions without the prerelease ([#19705](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/19705)) 
- Run spec-cleaner
- Add GOFLAGS=-mod=vendor to fix build on Tumbleweed and Leap 15.1

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr 13 08:29:41 UTC 2018 - tbechtold@suse.com

- update to 0.11.7:
  BUG FIXES:
  * core: Fix handling of interpolated counts when applying a destroy plan ([#17824](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17824))
  PROVIDER SDK CHANGES (not user-facing):
  * helper/schema: Invoking `ForceNew` on a key being removed from config during
    diff customization now correctly exposes that key as being removed in the
    updated diff. This prevents diff mismatches under certain circumstances.
    ([#17811](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17811))
  * helper/schema: Invoking `ForceNew` during diff customization on its own no
    longer writes any new data to the diff. This prevents writing of new nil to
    zero value diffs for sub-fields of complex lists and sets where a diff did not
    exist before. ([#17811](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17811))
  BUG FIXES:
  * cli: Don't allow -target without arguments ([#16360](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16360))
  * cli: Fix strange formatting of list and map values in the `terraform console` command ([#17714](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17714))
  * core: Don't evaluate unused outputs during a full destroy operation ([#17768](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17768))
  * core: Fix local and output evaluation when they reference a resource being scaled down to 0 ([#17765](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17765))
  * connection/ssh: Retry on authentication failures when the remote service is available before it is completely configured ([#17744](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17744))
  * connection/winrm: Get execution errors from winrm commands ([#17788](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17788))
  * connection/winrm: Support NTLM authentication ([#17748](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17748))
  * provisioner/chef: Fix regression causing connection to be prematurely closed ([#17609](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/pull/17609))
  * provisioner/habitat: Set channel and builder URL during install, and enable service before start ([#17403](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17403)) ([#17781](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17781))
  PROVIDER SDK CHANGES (not user-facing):
  * helper/schema: Attribute value is no longer included in error message when `ConflictsWith` keys are used together. ([#17738](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17738))
  IMPROVEMENTS:
  * provisioner/chef: Allow specifying a channel ([#17355](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17355))
  BUG FIXES:
  * core: Fix the timeout handling for provisioners ([#17646](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17646))
  * core: Ensure that state is unlocked after running console, import, graph or push commands ([#17645](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17645))
  * core: Don't open multiple file descriptors for local state files, which would cause reading the state to fail on Windows ([#17636](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17636))
  IMPROVEMENTS:
  * cli: `terraform state list` now accepts a new argument `-id=...` for filtering resources for display by their remote ids ([#17221](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17221))
  * cli: `terraform destroy` now uses the option `-auto-approve` instead of `-force`, for consistency with `terraform apply`. The old flag is preserved for backward-compatibility, but is now deprecated; it will be retained for at least one major release. ([#17218](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17218))
  * connection/ssh: Add support for host key verification ([#17354](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17354))
  * backend/s3: add support for the cn-northwest-1 region ([#17216](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17216))
  * provisioner/local-exec: Allow setting custom environment variables when running commands ([#13880](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/13880))
  * provisioner/habitat: Detect if hab user exists and only create if necessary ([#17195](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17195))
  * provisioner/habitat: Allow custom service name ([#17196](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17196))
  * general: https URLs are now supported in the HTTP_PROXY environment variable for URLs interpreted by Terraform Core. (This will not immediately be true for all Terraform provider plugins, since each must upgrade its own HTTP client.) [go1.10:net/http](https://golang.org/doc/go1.10#net/http)
  BUG FIXES:
  * core: Make sure state is locked during initial refresh ([#17422](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17422))
  * core: Halt on fatal provisioner errors, rather than retrying until a timeout ([#17359](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17359))
  * core: When handling a forced exit due to multiple interrupts, prevent the process from exiting while the state is being written ([#17323](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17323))
  * core: Fix handling of locals and outputs at destroy time ([#17241](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17241))
  * core: Fix regression in handling of `count` arguments that refer to `count` attributes from other resources ([#17548](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17548))
  * provider/terraform: restore support for the deprecated `environment` argument to the `terraform_remote_state` data source ([#17545](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17545))
  * backend/gcs: Report the correct lock ID for GCS state locks ([#17397](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17397))

  * helper/schema: Prevent crash on removal of computed field in CustomizeDiff ([#17261](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17261))
  * helper/schema: Allow ResourceDiff.ForceNew on nested fields (avoid crash) ([#17463](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17463))
  * helper/schema: Allow `TypeMap` to have a `*schema.Schema` as its `Elem`, for consistency with `TypeSet` and `TypeList` ([#17097](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17097))
  * helper/validation: Add ValidateRFC3339TimeString function ([#17484](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17484))

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Feb 17 14:34:33 UTC 2018 - fcastelli@suse.com

- Update to v0.11.3:
  * IMPROVEMENTS:
    * backend/s3: add support for the eu-west-3 region ([#17193](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17193))

    * config: fixed crash when module source is invalid ([#17134](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17134))
    * config: allow the count pseudo-attribute of a resource to be interpolated into `provisioner` and `connection` blocks without errors ([#17133](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17133))
    * backend/s3: allow the workspace name to be a prefix of workspace_key_prefix ([#17086](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17086))
    * provisioner/chef: fix crash when validating `use_policyfile` ([#17147](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17147))
- Changes of version 0.11.2:
  * BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES / NOTES:
    * backend/gcs: The gcs remote state backend was erroneously creating the state bucket if it didn't exist. This is not the intended behavior of backends, as Terraform cannot track or manage that resource. The target bucket must now be created separately, before using it with Terraform. ([#16865](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16865))
  * NEW FEATURES:
    * **[Habitat](https://www.habitat.sh/) Provisioner** allowing automatic installation of the Habitat agent ([#16280](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16280))
  * IMPROVEMENTS:
    * core: removed duplicate prompts and clarified working when migration backend configurations ([#16939](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16939))
    * config: new `rsadecrypt` interpolation function allows decrypting a base64-encoded ciphertext using a given private key. This is particularly useful for decrypting the password for a Windows instance on AWS EC2, but is generic and may find other uses too. ([#16647](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16647))
    * config: new `timeadd` interpolation function allows calculating a new timestamp relative to an existing known timestamp. ([#16644](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16644))
    * cli: Passing an empty string to `-plugin-dir` during init will remove previously saved paths ([#16969](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16969))
    * cli: Module and provider installation (and some other Terraform features) now implement [RFC6555](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6555) when making outgoing HTTP requests, which should improve installation reliability for dual-stack (both IPv4 and IPv6) hosts running on networks that have non-performant or broken IPv6 Internet connectivity by trying both IPv4 and IPv6 connections. ([#16805](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16805))
    * backend/s3: it is now possible to disable the region check, for improved compatibility with third-party services that attempt to mimic the S3 API. ([#16757](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16757))
    * backend/s3: it is now possible to for the path-based S3 API form, for improved compatibility with third-party services that attempt to mimic the S3 API. ([#17001](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17001))
    * backend/s3: it is now possible to use named credentials from the `~/.aws/credentials` file, similarly to the AWS plugin ([#16661](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16661))
    * backend/manta: support for Triton RBAC ([#17003](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17003))
    * backend/gcs: support for customer-supplied encryption keys for remote state buckets ([#16936](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16936))
    * provider/terraform: in `terraform_remote_state`, the argument `environment` is now deprecated in favor of `workspace`. The `environment` argument will be removed in a later Terraform release. ([#16558](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16558))
  * BUG FIXES:
    * config: fixed crash in `substr` interpolation function with invalid offset ([#17043](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17043))
    * config: Referencing a count attribute in an output no longer generates a warning ([#16866](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16866))
    * cli: Terraform will no longer crash when `terraform plan`, `terraform apply`, and some other commands encounter an invalid provider version constraint in configuration, generating a proper error message instead. ([#16867](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16867))
    * backend/gcs: The usage of the GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS environment variable now matches that of the google provider ([#16865](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16865))
    * backend/gcs: fixed the locking methodology to avoid "double-locking" issues when used with the `terraform_remote_state` data source ([#16852](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16852))
    * backend/s3: the `workspace_key_prefix` can now be an empty string or contain slashes ([#16932](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16932))
    * provisioner/salt-masterless: now waits for all of the remote operations to complete before returning ([#16704](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16704))
- Changes of version 0.11.1
  * IMPROVEMENTS:
    * modules: Modules can now receive a specific provider configuration in the `providers` map, even if it's only implicitly used ([#16619](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16619))
    * config: Terraform will now detect and warn about outputs containing potentially-problematic references to resources with `count` set where the references does not use the "splat" syntax. This identifies situations where an output may [reference a resource with `count = 0`](https://www.terraform.io/upgrade-guides/0-11.html#referencing-attributes-from-resources-with-count-0) even if the `count` expression does not _currently_ evaluate to `0`, allowing the bug to be detected and fixed _before_ the value is later changed to `0` and would thus become an error. **This usage will become a fatal error in Terraform 0.12**. ([#16735](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16735))
    * core: A new environment variable `TF_WARN_OUTPUT_ERRORS=1` is supported to opt out of the behavior introduced in 0.11.0 where errors in output expressions halt execution. This restores the previous behavior where such errors are ignored, allowing users to apply problematic configurations without fixing all of the errors. This opt-out will be removed in Terraform 0.12, so it is strongly recommended to use the new warning described in the previous item to detect and fix these problematic expressions. ([#16782](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16782))
  * BUG FIXES:
    * cli: fix crash when subcommands with sub-subcommands are accidentally provided as a single argument, such as `terraform "workspace list"` ([#16789](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16789))
- Changes of version 0.11.0
  * BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES / NOTES:
    The following items give an overview of the incompatibilities and other noteworthy changes in this release. For more details on some of these changes, along with information on how to upgrade existing configurations where needed, see [the v0.11 upgrade guide](https://www.terraform.io/upgrade-guides/0-11.html).
    * Output interpolation errors are now fatal. Module configs with unused outputs which contained errors will no longer be valid.
    * Module configuration blocks have 2 new reserved attribute names, "providers" and "version". Modules using these as input variables will need to be updated.
    * The module provider inheritance rules have changed. Inherited provider configurations will no longer be merged with local configurations, and additional (aliased) provider configurations must be explicitly passed between modules when shared. See [the upgrade guide](https://www.terraform.io/upgrade-guides/0-11.html) for more details.
    * The command `terraform apply` with no explicit plan argument is now interactive by default. Specifically, it will show the generated plan and wait for confirmation before applying it, similar to the existing behavior of `terraform destroy`. The behavior is unchanged when a plan file argument is provided, and the previous behavior can be obtained _without_ a plan file by using the `-auto-approve` option.
    * The `terraform` provider (that is, the provider that contains the `terraform_remote_state` data source) has been re-incorporated as a built-in provider in the Terraform Core executable. In 0.10 it was split into a separate plugin along with all of the other providers, but this provider uses several internal Terraform Core APIs and so in practice it's been confusing to version that separately from Terraform Core. As a consequence, this provider no longer supports version constraints, and so `version` attributes for this provider in configuration must be removed.
    * When remote state is enabled, Terraform will no longer generate a local `terraform.tfstate.backup` file before updating remote state. Previously this file could potentially be used to recover a previous state to help recover after a mistake, but it also caused a potentially-sensitive state file to be generated in an unexpected location that may be inadvertently copied or checked in to version control. With this local backup now removed, we recommend instead relying on versioning or backup mechanisms provided by the backend, such as Amazon S3 versioning or Terraform Enterprise's built-in state history mechanism. (Terraform will still create the local file `errored.tfstate` in the unlikely event that there is an error when writing to the remote backend.)
  * NEW FEATURES:
    * modules: Module configuration blocks now have a "version" attribute, to set a version constraint for modules sourced from a registry. ([#16466](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16466))
    * modules: Module configuration blocks now have a "providers" attribute, to map a provider configuration from the current module into a submodule ([#16379](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16379))
    * backend/gcs: The gcs remote state backend now supports workspaces and locking.
    * backend/manta: The Manta backend now supports workspaces and locking ([#16296](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16296))
  * IMPROVEMENTS:
    * cli: The `terraform apply` command now waits for interactive approval of the generated plan before applying it, unless an explicit plan file is provided. ([#16502](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16502))
    * cli: The `terraform version` command now prints out the version numbers of initialized plugins as well as the version of Terraform core, so that they can be more easily shared when opening GitHub Issues, etc. ([#16439](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16439))
    * cli: A new `TF_DATA_DIR` environment variable can be used to override the location where Terraform stores the files normally placed in the `.terraform` directory. ([#16207](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16207))
    * provider/terraform: now built in to Terraform Core so that it will always have the same backend functionality as the Terraform release it corresponds to. ([#16543](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16543))
  * BUG FIXES:
    * config: Provider config in submodules will no longer be overridden by parent providers with the same name. ([#16379](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16379))
    * cli: When remote state is enabled, Terraform will no longer generate a local `terraform.tfstate.backup` file before updating remote state. ([#16464](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16464))
    * core: state now includes a reference to the provider configuration most recently used to create or update a resource, so that the same configuration can be used to destroy that resource if its configuration (including the explicit pointer to a provider configuration) is removed ([#16586](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16586))
    * core: Module outputs can now produce errors, preventing them from silently propagating through the config. ([#16204](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16204))
    * backend/gcs: will now automatically add a slash to the given prefix if not present, since without it the workspace enumeration does not function correctly ([#16585](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16585))
  * PROVIDER FRAMEWORK CHANGES (not user-facing):
    * helper/schema: Loosen validation for 'id' field ([#16456](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16456))
- Changes of version 0.10.8
  * NEW FEATURES:
    * **New `etcdv3` backend**, for use with the newer etcd api ([#15680](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/15680))
    * **New interpolation function `chunklist`**, for spliting a list into a list of lists with specified sublist chunk sizes. ([#15112](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/15112))
  * IMPROVEMENTS:
    * backend/s3: Add options to skip AWS validation which allows non-AWS S3 backends ([#15553](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/15553))
  * BUG FIXES:
    * command/validate: Respect `-plugin-dir` overridden plugin paths in the `terraform validate` command. ([#15985](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/15985))
    * provisioner/chef: Clean clients from `chef-vault` when `recreate_client` enabled ([#16357](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16357))
    * communicator/winrm: Support the `cacert` option for custom certificate authorities when provisioning over WinRM ([#14783](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/14783))

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct  4 16:15:49 UTC 2017 - thipp@suse.de

- Update to v0.10.7:
  - NEW FEATURES:
    * Provider plugins can now optionally be cached in a shared directory to
      avoid re-downloading them for each configuration working directory. For
      more information, see the documentation. (#16000)
  - IMPROVEMENTS:
    * config: New abs interpolation function, returning the absolute value of a
      number (#16168)
    * config: New transpose interpolation function, which swaps the keys and
      values in a map of lists of strings. (#16192)
    * cli: The Terraform CLI now supports tab-completion for commands and
      certain arguments for bash and zsh users. See the tab-completion docs for
      information on how to enable it. (#16176)
    * cli: terraform state rm now includes in its output the count of resources
      that were removed from the state. (#16137)
  - BUG FIXES:
    * modules: Update go-getter to fix crash when fetching invalid source
      subdir (#16161)
    * modules: Fix regression in the handling of modules sourcing other modules
      with relative paths (#16160)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep 19 15:40:47 UTC 2017 - thipp@suse.de

- Update to v0.10.6:
  - UPGRADE NOTES:
    * The internal storage of modules has changed in this release, so after
      upgrading terraform init must be run to re-install modules in the new
      on-disk format. The existing installed versions of modules will be
      ignored, so the latest version of each module will be installed.
  - IMPROVEMENTS:
  * cli: terraform import now accepts an option -allow-missing-config that
    overrides the default requirement that a configuration block must already
    be present for the resource being imported. (#15876)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 18 08:15:43 UTC 2017 - thipp@suse.de

- Update to v0.10.5:
  - NEW FEATURES:
    * config: indent interpolation function appends spaces to all but the first
      line of a multi-line string (#15311)
  - IMPROVEMENTS:
    * cli: terraform fmt has a new option -check which makes it return a
      non-zero exit status if any formatting changes are required (#15387)
    * cli: When running Terraform in automation, a new environment variable
      TF_IN_AUTOMATION can be used to disable or adjust certain prompts that
      would normally include specific CLI commands to run. This assumes that
      the wrapping automation tool is providing its own UI for guiding the user
      through the workflow, and thus the standard advice would be redundant
      and/or confusing. (#16059)
  - BUG FIXES:
    * cli: restore the "(forces new resource)" annotations on attributes that
      were inadvertently disabled in 0.10.4. (#16067)
    * cli: fix regression with installing modules from git when the
      GIT_SSH_COMMAND environment variable is set (#16099)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep  7 15:37:21 UTC 2017 - thipp@suse.de

- Update to v0.10.4:
  - IMPROVEMENTS:
    * terraform apply now uses the standard resource address syntax to refer to
      resources in its log (#15884)
    * terraform plan output has some minor adjustments to improve readability
      and accessibility for those who can't see its colors (#15884)
  - BUG FIXES:
    * backend/consul: fix crash during consul backend initialization (#15976)
    * backend/azurerm: ensure that blob storage metadata is preserved when
      updating state blobs, to avoid losing track of lock metadata (#16015)
    * config: local values now work properly in resource count and in modules
      with more than one .tf file (#15995] [#15982)
    * cli: removed some inconsistencies in how data sources are counted and
      tallied in plan vs. apply and apply vs. destroy. In particular, data
      sources are no longer incorrectly counted as destroyed in terraform
      destroy (#15884)

- Update to v0.10.3:
  - BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES / NOTES:
    * LGPL Dependencies Removed (#15862)
  - NEW FEATURES:
    * Local Values: this new configuration language feature allows assigning a
      symbolic local name to an expression so it can be used multiple times in
      configuration without repetition. See the documentation for how to define
      and use local values. (#15449)
    * base64gzip interpolation function: compresses a string with gzip and then
      base64-encodes the result (#3858)
    * flatten interpolation function: turns a list of lists, or list of lists
      of lists, etc into a flat list of primitive values (#15278)
    * urlencode interpolation function: applies standard URL encoding to a
      string so that it can be embedded in a URL without making it invalid and
      without any of the characters being interpreted as part of the URL
      structure (#15871)
    * salt-masterless provisioner: runs Salt in masterless mode on a target
      server (#14720)
  - IMPROVEMENTS:
    * config: The jsonencode interpolation function now accepts nested list and
      map structures, where before it would accept only strings, lists of
      strings, and maps of strings. (#14884)
    * cli: The "creation complete" (and similar) messages from terraform apply
      now include a total elapsed time for each operation. (#15548)
    * cli: Module installation (with either terraform init or terraform get)
      now detects and recursively initializes submodules when the source is a
      git repository. (#15891)
    * cli: Modules can now be installed from .tar.xz archives, in addition to
      the existing .tar.gz, .tar.bz2 and .zip. (#15891)
    * provisioner/local-exec: now possible to specify a custom "interpreter",
      overriding the default of either bash -c (on Unix) or cmd.exe /C (on
      Windows) (#15166)
    * backend/consul: can now set the path to a specific CA certificate file,
      client certificate file, and client key file that will be used when
      configuring the underlying Consul client. (#15405)
    * backend/http: now has optional support for locking, with special support
      from the target server. Additionally, the update operation can now
      optionally be implemented via PUT rather than POST. (#15793)
    * helper/resource: Add TestStep.SkipFunc (#15957)
  - BUG FIXES:
    * cli: terraform init now verifies the required Terraform version from the
      root module config. Previously this was verified only on subsequent
      commands, after initialization. (#15935)
    * cli: terraform validate now consults terraform.tfvars, if present, to set
      variable values. This is now consistent with the behavior of other
      commands. (#15938)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug 17 07:58:32 UTC 2017 - thipp@suse.de

- Update to v0.10.2:
  - BUG FIXES:
    * tools/terraform-bundle: Add missing Ui to ProviderInstaller (fix crash) (#15826)
    * go-plugin: crash when server emits non-key-value JSON (go-plugin#43)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug 16 10:07:49 UTC 2017 - thipp@suse.de

- Update to v0.10.1:
  - BUG FIXES:

    * Fix errors when interpolations fail during input (#15780)
    * Backoff retried in remote-execution provisioner (#15772)
    * Load plugins from ~/.terraform.d/plugins/OS_ARCH/ and .terraformrc (#15769)
    * The import command was ignoring the remote state configuration (#15768)
    * Don't allow leading slashes in s3 bucket names for remote state (#15738)
  - IMPROVEMENTS:
    * helper/schema: Add GetOkExists schema function (#15723)
    * helper/schema: Make 'id' a reserved field name (#15695)
    * command/init: Display version + source when initializing plugins (#15804)
  - INTERNAL CHANGES:
    * DiffFieldReader.ReadField caches results to optimize deeply nested schemas (#15663)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug  8 10:44:49 UTC 2017 - thipp@suse.de

- Update to v0.10.0:
  - BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES / NOTES:
    * A new flag -auto-approve has been added to terraform apply. This flag controls whether an interactive approval is applied before making the changes in the plan. For now this flag defaults to true to preserve previous behavior, but this will become the new default in a future version. We suggest that anyone running terraform apply in wrapper scripts or automation refer to the upgrade guide to learn how to prepare such wrapper scripts for the later breaking change.
    * The validate command now checks that all variables are specified by default. The validation will fail by default if that's not the case. (#13872)
    * terraform state rm now requires at least one argument. Previously, calling it with no arguments would remove all resources from state, which is consistent with the other terraform state commands but unlikely enough that we considered it better to be inconsistent here to reduce the risk of accidentally destroying the state.
    * Terraform providers are no longer distributed as part of the main Terraform distribution. Instead, they are installed automatically as part of running terraform init. It is therefore now mandatory to run terraform init before any other operations that use provider plugins, to ensure that the required plugins are installed and properly initialized.
    * The terraform env family of commands have been renamed to terraform workspace, in response to feedback that the previous naming was confusing due to collisions with other concepts of the same name. The commands still work the same as they did before, and the env subcommand is still supported as an alias for backward compatibility. The env subcommand will be removed altogether in a future release, so it's recommended to update any automation or wrapper scripts that use these commands.
    * The terraform init subcommand no longer takes a SOURCE argument to copy to the current directory. The behavior has been changed to match that of plan and apply, so that a configuration can be provided as an argument on the commandline while initializing the current directory. If a module needs to be copied into the current directory before initialization, it will have to be done manually.
    * The -target option available on several Terraform subcommands has changed behavior and now matches potentially more resources. In particular, given an option -target=module.foo, resources in any descendent modules of foo will also be targeted, where before this was not true. After upgrading, be sure to look carefully at the set of changes proposed by terraform plan when using -target to ensure that the target is being interpreted as expected. Note that the -target argument is offered for exceptional circumstances only and is not intended for routine use.
    * The import command requires that imported resources be specified in the configuration file. Previously, users were encouraged to import a resource and then write the configuration block for it. This creates the risk that users could import a resource and subsequently create no configuration for it, which results in Terraform deleting the resource. If the imported resource is not present in the configuration file, the import command will fail.
  - FEATURES:
    * Separate Provider Releases: Providers are now released independently from Terraform.
    * Automatic Provider Installation: The required providers will be automatically installed during terraform init.
    * Provider Constraints: Provider are now versioned, and version constraints may be declared in the configuration.
  - PROVIDERS:
    * Providers now maintain their own CHANGELOGs in their respective repositories: terraform-providers
  - IMPROVEMENTS:
    * cli: Add a -from-module flag to terraform init to re-introduce the legacy terraform init behavior of fetching a module. (#15666)
    * backend/s3: Add workspace_key_prefix to allow a user-configurable prefix for workspaces in the S3 Backend. (#15370)
    * cli: terraform apply now has an option -auto-approve=false that produces an interactive prompt to approve the generated plan. This will become the default workflow in a future Terraform version. (#7251)
    * cli: terraform workspace show command prints the current workspace name in a way that's more convenient for processing in wrapper scripts. (#15157)
    * cli: terraform state rm will now generate an error if no arguments are passed, whereas before it treated it as an open resource address selecting all resources (#15283)
    * cli: Files in the config directory ending in .auto.tfvars are now loaded automatically (in lexicographical order) in addition to the single terraform.tfvars file that auto-loaded previously. (#13306)
    * Providers no longer in the main Terraform distribution; installed automatically by init instead (#15208)
    * cli: terraform env command renamed to terraform workspace (#14952)
    * cli: terraform init command now has -upgrade option to download the latest versions (within specified constraints) of modules and provider plugins.
    * cli: The -target option to various Terraform operation can now target resources in descendent modules. (#15314)
    * cli: Minor updates to terraform plan output: use standard resource address syntax, more visually-distinct -/+ actions, and more (#15362)
    * config: New interpolation function contains, to find if a given string exists in a list of strings. (#15322)
  - BUG FIXES:
    * provisioner/chef: fix panic (#15617)
    * Don't show a message about the path to the state file if the state is remote (#15435)
    * Fix crash when terraform graph is run with no configuration (#15588)
    * Handle correctly the .exe suffix on locally-compiled provider plugins on Windows systems. (#15587)
    * config: Fixed a parsing issue in the interpolation language HIL that was causing misinterpretation of literal strings ending with escaped backslashes (#15415)
    * core: the S3 Backend was failing to remove the state file checksums from DynamoDB when deleting a workspace (#15383)
    * core: Improved reslience against crashes for a certain kind of inconsistency in the representation of list values in state. (#15390)
    * core: Display correct to and from backends in copy message when migrating to new remote state (#15318)
    * core: Fix a regression from 0.9.6 that was causing the tally of resources to create to be double-counted sometimes in the plan output (#15344)
    * cli: the state rm and mv commands were always loading a state from a Backend, and ignoring the -state flag (#15388)
    * cli: certain prompts in terraform init were respecting -input=false but not the TF_INPUT environment variable (#15391)
    * state: Further work, building on #15423, to improve the internal design of the state managers to make this code more maintainable and reduce the risk of regressions; this may lead to slight changes to the number of times Terraform writes to remote state and how the serial is implemented with respect to those writes, which does not affect outward functionality but is worth noting if you log or inspect state updates for debugging purposes.
    * config: Interpolation function cidrhost was not correctly calcluating host addresses under IPv6 CIDR prefixes (#15321)
    * provisioner/chef: Prevent a panic while trying to read the connection info (#15271)
    * provisioner/file: Refactor the provisioner validation function to prevent false positives (#15273)
  - INTERNAL CHANGES:
    * helper/schema: Actively disallow reserved field names in schema (#15522)
    * helper/schema: Force field names to be alphanum lowercase + underscores (#15562)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul  4 08:19:41 UTC 2017 - thipp@suse.de

- Update to v0.9.11:
  - BUG FIXES:
    * core: Hotfix for issue where a state from a plan was reported as not equal to the same state stored to a backend. This arose from the fix for the previous issue where the incorrect copy of the state was being used when applying with a plan. (#15460)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul  3 09:18:59 UTC 2017 - thipp@suse.de

- Update to v0.9.10:
  - BUG FIXES:
    * core: Hotfix for issue where state index wasn't getting properly incremented when applying a change containing only data source updates and/or resource drift. (That is, state changes made during refresh.) This issue is significant only for the "atlas" backend, since that backend verifies on the server that state serial numbers are being used consistently. (#15423)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun 27 09:01:25 UTC 2017 - thipp@suse.de

- Update to v0.9.9:

    * provisioner/chef: Prevent a panic while trying to read the connection info (#15271)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun 13 12:57:34 UTC 2017 - thipp@suse.com

- Update to v0.9.8:
  - NOTE:
    * The 0.9.7 release had a bug with its new feature of periodically persisting state to the backend during an apply, as part of [#14834].  This change has been reverted in this release and will be re-introduced at a later time once it has been made to work properly.
  - IMPROVEMENTS:
    * provider/google: network argument in google_compute_instance_group is now optional (#13493)
    * provider/google: Add support for draining_timeout_sec to google_compute_backend_service. (#14559)
  - BUG FIXES:
    * provider/aws: fixed reading network configurations for spot_fleet_request
      (#13748)

- Update to v0.9.7:
  - BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES / NOTES:
    * The lock_table attribute in the S3 backend configuration has been deprecated in favor of dynamodb_table, which better reflects that the table is no longer only used for locks. (#14949)

- Update to v0.9.6:
  - BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES / NOTES:
    * When assigning a "splat variable" to a resource attribute, like foo = "${some_resource.foo.*.baz}", it is no longer required (nor recommended) to wrap the string in list brackets. The extra brackets continue to be allowed for resource attributes for compatibility, but this will cease to be allowed in a future version. (#14737)
    * provider/aws: Allow lightsail resources to work in other regions. Previously Terraform would automatically configure lightsail resources to run solely in us-east-1. This means that if a provider was initialized with a different region than us-east-1, users will need to create a provider alias to maintain their lightsail resources in us-east-1 [#14685].
    * provider/aws: Users of aws_cloudfront_distribution default_cache_behavior will notice that cookies is now a required value - even if that value is none (#12628)
    * provider/google: Users of google_compute_health_check who were not setting a value for the host property of http_health_check or https_health_check previously had a faulty default value. This has been fixed and will show as a change in terraform plan/apply. (#14441)

- Update to v0.9.0:
  - This is the complete 0.8.8 to 0.9 CHANGELOG. Below this section we also have a 0.9.0-beta2 to 0.9.0 final CHANGELOG.

    * provider/azurerm: sql_server administrator_login_password now marked as sensitive
    * provider/dnsimple: Provider has been upgraded to APIv2 therefore, you will need to use the APIv2 auth token
    * provider/google: storage buckets have been updated with the new storage classes. The old classes will continue working as before, but should be migrated as soon as possible, as there's no guarantee they'll continue working forever. (#12044)
    * provider/google: compute_instance, compute_instance_template, and compute_disk all have a subtly changed logic when specifying an image family as the image; in 0.8.x they would pin to the latest image in the family when the resource is created; in 0.9.x they pass the family to the API and use its behaviour. New input formats are also supported. (#12223)
    * provider/google: removed the unused and deprecated region field from google_compute_backend_service (#12663)

- Update to v0.8.4:
  - BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES / NOTES:
    * We have removed the Arukas provider that was added in v0.8.3 for this release. Unfortunately we found the new provider included a dependency that would not compile and run on Windows operating systems. For now the provider has been removed and we hope to work to reintroduce it for all platforms in the near future. Going forward we will also be taking additional steps in our build testing to ensure Terraform builds on all platforms before release.

Mon Dec 19 13:10:53 UTC 2016 - thipp@suse.de

- Update to v0.8.1:
  - IMPROVEMENTS:
    * provider/aws: Support eu-west-2 (#10470)
    * provider/aws: Improved the SNS topic subscription protocols validation (#10704)
    * providers/google: Add subnetwork_project field to enable cross-project networking (#9662)
    * provider/pagerduty: Allow 'team_responder' role for pagerduty_user resource (#10728)
  - BUG FIXES:
    * core: Handle whitespace around the key in the -var flag. (#10717)
    * core: terraform block works in the presence of _override files (#10715)
    * core: Fix error when a provider in a module only referenced a variable (#10719)
    * core: Destroy ordering for resources that depend on each other across modules is correct (#745)
  - DEPRECATION REMOVALS:
    * provider/aws: Removed deprecated parameter_group from aws_rds_cluster (#10733)

- Update to v0.8.0:
  - BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES / NOTES:
    * template_file inline templates must escape their variable usage. What was previously ${foo} must now be $${foo}. Note that this is only for inline templates. Templates read from files are unchanged. (#9698)
    * Escape sequences used to require double-escaping when used within interpolations. You now must only escape once (which is the expected/typical behavior). For example: ${replace(var.foo, "\\", "\\\\")} is correct. Before, that would cause very strange behavior. However, this may break existing configurations which found a level of escape sequences to work. Check terraform plan for incorrect output.
    * Math operators now follow the standard order of operations: *, /, % followed by +, -. See the updated interpolation docs for more information. You can continue to force ordering with parentheses.
    * Strings in configuration can no longer contain unescaped newlines. For unescaped newlines, heredocs must be used
    *
    * provider/aws: Anywhere where we can specify kms_key_id must now be a valid KMS Key ID ARN to stop continual diffs
    *
    * provider/chef: The chef provider now accepts key_material as an alternative to private_key_pem. The private_key_pem attribute will be deprecated in a future release
    * provider/postgres: ssl_mode has been renamed sslmode to match common usage (#10682)
  - DEPRECATION REMOVALS:
    * The template_file resource no longer accepts a direct file path for the template attribute. You may either specify a path wrapped in a file function or specify a file path with the filepath attribute. This was deprecated during 0.7.x.
  - FEATURES:
    * New command: terraform console, an interactive console for experimenting with and using interpolations. (#10093)
    * Terraform version requirement in configuration. You can now specify a Terraform version requirement in configuration and modules. (#10080)
    * Conditional values: You can now use conditionals to determine the values of attributes. For example: count = "${var.env == "prod" ? 1 : 0}".
    * depends_on can reference modules. This allows a resource or output to depend on everything within a module. (#10076)
    * output supports depends_on. This is useful when the output depends on a certain ordering to happen that can't be represented with interpolations. (#10072)
    * Providers and resources are now notified by Terraform core to "stop" when an interrupt is received, allowing resources to gracefully exit much, much faster. (#9607)
    * The import command can now specify a provider alias to use. (#10310)
    * The import command will now read provider configuration from Terraform configuration files (including loading tfvars files and so on). (#9809)

    * provider/aws: Add support for AWS CA Central 1 Region (#10618)
    * provider/aws: Allow importing of aws_iam_role, aws_iam_role_policy and aws_iam_policy (#9398)
    * provider/aws: Added s3 bucket region attribute management (#10482)

- Update to v0.7.3
  - BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES / NOTES:
    * Terraform now validates the uniqueness of variable and output names in your configurations. In prior versions certain ways of duplicating variable names would work. This is now a configuration error (and should've always been). If you get an error running Terraform you may need to remove the duplicates. Done right, this should not affect the behavior of Terraform.
    * The internal structure of .terraform/modules changed slightly. For configurations with modules, you'll need to run terraform get again.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug  5 10:51:35 UTC 2016 - thipp@suse.de

- Updated to v0.7.0

BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES / NOTES:

- Terraform Core
  * Terraform's built-in plugins are now distributed as part of the main Terraform binary, and use the go-plugin framework. Overrides are still available using separate binaries, but will need recompiling against Terraform 0.7.
  * The terraform plan command no longer persists state. This makes the command much safer to run, since it is now side-effect free. The refresh and apply commands still persist state to local and remote storage. Any automation that assumes that terraform plan persists state will need to be reworked to explicitly call terraform refresh to get the equivalent side-effect. (The terraform plan command no longer has the -state-out or -backup flags due to this change.)
  * The concat() interpolation function can no longer be used to join strings.
  * Quotation marks may no longer be escaped in HIL expressions (#7201)
  * Lists materialized using splat syntax, for example aws_instance.foo.*.id are now ordered by the count index rather than lexographically sorted. If this produces a large number of undesirable differences, you can use the new sort() interpolation function to produce the previous behaviour.
  * You now access the values of maps using the syntax var.map["key"] or the lookup function instead of var.map.key.
  * Outputs on terraform_remote_state resources are now top level attributes rather than inside the output map. In order to access outputs, use the syntax: terraform_remote_state.name.outputname. Currently outputs cannot be named config or backend.
- AWS Provider
  * aws_elb now defaults cross_zone_load_balancing to true
  * aws_instance: EC2 Classic users may continue to use security_groups to reference Security Groups by their name. Users who are managing Instances inside VPCs will need to use vpc_security_group_ids instead, and reference the security groups by their id. Ref https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/6416#issuecomment-219145065
  * aws_kinesis_firehose_delivery_stream: AWS Kinesis Firehose has been refactored to support Redshift as a destination in addition to S3. As a result, the configuration has changed and users will need to update their configuration to match the new s3_configuration block. Checkout the documentaiton on AWS Kinesis Firehose for more information (#7375)
  * aws_route53_record: latency_routing_policy, geolocation_routing_policy, and failover_routing_policy block options have been added. With these additions we’ve renamed the weight attribute to weighted_routing_policy, and it has changed from a string to a block to match the others. Please see the updated documentation on using weighted_routing_policy: https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/route53_record.html . (#6954)
  * aws_db_instance now defaults publicly_accessible to false
- Microsoft Azure Provider
  * In documentation, the "Azure (Resource Manager)" provider has been renamed to the "Microsoft Azure" provider.
  * azurerm_dns_cname_record now accepts a single record rather than a list of records
  * azurerm_virtual_machine computer_name now Required
- Openstack Provider
  * openstack_networking_subnet_v2 now defaults to turning DHCP on.
  * openstack_fw_policy_v1 now correctly applies rules in the order they are specified. Upon the next apply, current rules might be re-ordered.
  * The member attribute of openstack_lb_pool_v1 has been deprecated. Please ue the new openstack_lb_member_v1 resource.
- Docker Provider
  * keep_updated parameter removed from docker_image - This parameter never did what it was supposed to do. See relevant docs, specifically pull_trigger & new docker_registry_image data source to understand how to keep your docker_image updated.
- Atlas Provider
  * atlas_artifact resource has be deprecated. Please use the new atlas_artifact Data Source.
- CloudStack Provider
  * All deprecated parameters are removed from all CloudStack resources

FEATURES:

- Data sources are a new kind of primitive in Terraform. Attributes for data sources are refreshed and available during the planning stage. (#6598)
- Lists and maps can now be used as first class types for variables and may also be passed between modules. (#6322)
- State management CLI commands provide a variety of state manipulation functions for advanced use cases. This should be used where possible instead of manually modifying state files. (#5811)
- State Import allows a way to import existing resources into Terraform state for many types of resource. Initial coverage of AWS is quite high, and it is straightforward to add support for new resources.
