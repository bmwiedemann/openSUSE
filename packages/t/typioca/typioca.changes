- Packaging improvements:
  * Summary and Description clarify the purpose of this TUI tool
  * Remove unused BuildRequires: zstd does not match archive format
  * _service recompress change from xz to gz. The source archive is
    not large and xz unpack times are noticeably slower. If gz is
    not ideal for a given application, zstd is a good alternative.
  * Normalize go build invocation extracted from upstream Makefile
  * Build PIE with pattern that may become recommended procedure:
    %%ifnarch ppc64 GOFLAGS="-buildmode=pie" %%endif go build
    A go toolchain buildmode default config would be preferable
    but none exist at this time.
  * Drop mod=vendor, go1.14+ will detect vendor dir and auto-enable
  * Remove go build -a forced rebuild of packages. Rebuild is not
    needed in an OBS rpmbuild environment.
  * Remove forced use of pure Go DNS resolver via -tags netgo or
    GODEBUG=netdns=go. The Go DNS resolver is already the default
    (https://pkg.go.dev/net#hdr-Name_Resolution).
  * Remove ldflags -X entries for upstream import path and version.
    This information is embedded in binaries with go1.18+ and
    available via go version -m or runtime/debug.ReadBuildInfo().
  * Move %check section directly after %build
