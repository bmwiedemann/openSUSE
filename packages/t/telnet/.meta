  <title>A client program for the telnet remote login protocol</title>
  <description>Telnet is an old protocol for logging into remote systems.  It is
rarely used, since the transfer is not encrypted (ssh is mostly used
these days).  The telnet client is often used for debugging other
network services. The command

telnet localhost 25

connects to the local smtp server, for example.</description>
