      WebResources (bsc#1243815)
    + CVE-2025-48988: limits the total number of parts in a

      methods for a request with content type multipart/form-data when
      the mapped servlet does not have a @MultipartConfig or equivalent
      should not trigger an exception. Note that calling getPart() or
      getParts() is these circumstances will trigger an exception.
    + Add: Support parsing of multiple path parameters separated by ; in a
      single URL segment. Based on pull request #860 by Chenjp.
    + Fix: 69699: Encode redirect URL used by the rewrite valve with the
      session id if appropriate, and handle cross context with different
      session configuration when using rewrite.
    + Add: #863: Support for comments at the end of lines in text rewrite
      map files to align behaviour with Apache httpd. Pull request
      provided by Chenjp.
    + Fix: 69706: Saved request serialization issue in FORM introduced
      when allowing infinite session timeouts.
    + Fix: Expand the path checks for Pre-Resources and Post-Resources
      mounted at a path within the web application.
    + Fix: Process possible path parameters rewrite production in the
      rewrite valve.
    + Fix: 69588: Enable allowLinking to be set on PreResources,
      JarResources and PostResources. If not set explicitly, the setting
      will be inherited from the Resources.
    + Add: 69633: Support for Filters using context root mappings.

      application resources are accessed via a URL.
  * Coyote
    + Refactor: #861: TaskQueue to use the new interface RetryableQueue
      which enables better integration of custom Executors which provide
      their own BlockingQueue implementation. Pull request provided by
      Paulo Almeida.
    + Add: Finer grained control of multi-part request processing via two
      new attributes on the Connector element. maxPartCount limits the
      total number of parts in a multi-part request and maxPartHeaderSize
      limits the size of the headers provided with each part. Add support
      for these new attributes to the ParameterLimitValve.

      insensitive file systems that was exposed by the test case for
      69635.
  * Web applications
    + Fix: 69694: Improve error reporting of deployment tasks done using
      the manager webapp when a copy operation fails.
    + Add: 68876: Documentation. Update the UML diagrams for server
      start-up, request processing and authentication using PlantUML and
      include the source files for each diagram.
