  <description>TinyGo brings the Go programming language to embedded systems and to the modern web by creating a new compiler based on LLVM.

You can compile and run TinyGo programs on over 100 different microcontroller boards from maker boards such as the BBC micro:bit and the Arduino Uno, to industrial processors from Nordic Semiconductor and ST Microelectronics.

  TinyGo can also produce WebAssembly (WASM) code which is very compact in size. You can compile programs for web browsers, as well as for server and edge computing environments that support the WebAssembly System Interface (WASI) family of interfaces. </description>
