    <comment>New package tinygo version 0.33 is a Go compiler intended for use in small places such as microcontrollers, WebAssembly (wasm/wasi), and command-line tools.

It reuses libraries used by the Go language tools alongside LLVM to provide an alternative way to compile programs written in the Go programming language.</comment>

    <comment>- Update to version 0.35.0. Improved error messages, and also a new
  HTML size report. Several CGo improvements, such as support for
  function-like macros. New hardware support for the new RP2350
  microcontroller, with the Raspberry Pi Pico2 and Pimoroni
  Tiny2350 boards. And we are excited to bring our first software
  RISC-V running on FPGA to TinyGo with the newly added Tillitis
  TKey hardware device.

- Update to version 0.34.0. Export WebAssembly functions to the
  host. Improved garbage collection performance (especially on
  wasm), Add big-endian MIPS support (GOOS=mips), add two new
  boards: RAKwireless RAK4631, WaveShare ESP-C3-32S-Kit.

- Packaging improvements:
  * _service use mode manual replacing deprecated mode disabled
  * Re-enable binary stripping and debuginfo boo#1210938
  * Update to BuildRequires: golang(API) &gt;= 1.19 matching go.mod
  * Use autosetup -a 1 to unpack source and vendored dependencies
  * Build PIE with pattern that may become recommended procedure:
    %%ifnarch ppc64 GOFLAGS=&quot;-buildmode=pie&quot; %%endif go build
    A go toolchain buildmode default config would be preferable
    but none exist at this time.
  * Drop mod=vendor, go1.14+ will detect vendor dir and auto-enable
