  <title>Telepathy Mission Control instant messaging connection manager</title>
  <description>Mission Control, or MC, is a Telepathy component providing a way for
&quot;end-user&quot; applications to abstract some of the details of connection
managers, to provide a simple way to manipulate a bunch of connection
managers at once, to remove the need to have in each program the
account definitions and credentials, to manage channel handling/request
and to manage presence statuses.</description>
