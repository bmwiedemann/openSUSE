- Update to release 0.99.5
  * Implemented a new higher performance octahedron normal vector
    decoding variant that eliminates GPU SIMD divergence and
    costs fewer instructions
  * Added a completely flattened closest-hit dispatch approach
    through bitwise manipulation of the outpus of the OptiX 7
    optixGetHitKind() and optixGetPrimitiveType() APIs.
  * Added SBT-local hitgroup geometry flags containing
    cached/flattened material opacity, texture alpha cutout, and
    other information useful for short-circuiting frequent high
    latency data fetches from global memory or textures,
    particularly those items needed for for any-hit programs.

- Update to release 0.99.4
  * Added support for AO maximum occlusion distance cutoff, for
    convenient rendering of interior scenes where the "sky" would
    otherwise be largely or fully occluded.
  * Updated grid acceleration structure generation logic to avoid
    integer wraparound when working with scenes containing
    billions of objects and very large resulting grids.
  * Added a rough draft implementation of a quadrilateral mesh
    primitive
  * Migrated gradient noise magnitude and associated calculations
    outside of the ray tracing kernels themselves.
  * Unified the various camera raygen program alpha transparency
    code.
  * Added mainstream tone mapping operators and corrected alpha
    channel handling in colorspace conversions.

Wed Feb  5 01:23:51 UTC 2014 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 0.99~b6
* a new barrier synchronization mechanism was implemented for
  synchronizing the pool of worker threads on each node prior to
  sending/receiving the image buffer via MPI.
* Added support for atomic integer ops for improved performance
  when mixing threads and distributed memory message passing.

- added *.h in the devel packages... I hope I added all 
  I have managed to build vmd from cvs with them
