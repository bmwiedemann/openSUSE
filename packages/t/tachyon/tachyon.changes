- Update to release 0.99.4
  * Added support for AO maximum occlusion distance cutoff, for
    convenient rendering of interior scenes where the "sky" would
    otherwise be largely or fully occluded.
  * Updated grid acceleration structure generation logic to avoid
    integer wraparound when working with scenes containing
    billions of objects and very large resulting grids.
  * Added a rough draft implementation of a quadrilateral mesh
    primitive
  * Migrated gradient noise magnitude and associated calculations
    outside of the ray tracing kernels themselves.
  * Unified the various camera raygen program alpha transparency
    code.

    channel handling in colorspace conversions.
