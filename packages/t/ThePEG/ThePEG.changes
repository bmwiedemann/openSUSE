- Update to version 2.0.4:
  * Default weight explicitly labelled: The nominal event weight
    is now labelled "Default" and is always the first weight to be

  * LesHouches event weights handling: There are now two options
    for the treatment of optional weights coming in from a Les
    Houches file, available through
    "LesHouchesEventHandler:WeightNormalization". Either they are
    normalized to the "Default" weight ("Normalized"), or they are
    given as cross-sections in pb ("CrossSection"). The default
    behaviour is "Normalized".
  * JetFinder in Cuts objects writes information: The selected
    JetFinder is explicitly listed in the debug output.
