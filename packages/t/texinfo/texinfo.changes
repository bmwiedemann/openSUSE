Tue Nov 15 07:55:39 UTC 2022 - Dr. Werner Fink <werner@suse.de>

- Update to version 7.0 (7 November 2022)
  * texi2any
   * LaTeX added as an output format, selected with --latex
   * EPUB 3 added as an output format, selected with --epub3
   * reform throughout the code in general
   * thorough review of character encoding issues
   * new customization variables involved with character encoding:
       INPUT_FILE_NAME_ENCODING, OUTPUT_FILE_NAME_ENCODING,
       DOC_ENCODING_FOR_INPUT_FILE_NAME, DOC_ENCODING_FOR_OUTPUT_FILE_NAME,
       MESSAGE_ENCODING and COMMAND_LINE_ENCODING
   * warn if full-text commands (@ref, @footnote, @anchor) appear in @w
   * new variable NO_TOP_NODE_OUTPUT
   * IGNORE_BEFORE_SETFILENAME variable removed.  former effect
     is now always on.

         manual_name or manual_name.html
       * default DOCTYPE declaration changed to plain HTML5 style rather than
         HTML4 DTD reference
       * output only the CSS rules that are needed in an output file
       . remove CSS_LINES variable and add SHOW_BUILTIN_CSS_RULES
       * (custom CSS can still be output using EXTRA_HEAD)

         valid XHTML
       * systematic addition of classes attribute in HTML elements based on the
         Texinfo @-command names.  renaming of class attributes to avoid
         confusion with @-commands formatting and describe the role in the
         document rather than the formatting style.
       * COPIABLE_ANCHORS renamed to COPIABLE_LINKS
       * do not add a title by default; SHOW_TITLE or NO_TOP_NODE_OUTPUT has
         to be set

         for now.
       * replace @definfocenlose defined @-commands by the argument as-is
         to be more consistent with printed output
   * HTML/DocBook output:
       * USE_NUMERIC_ENTITY changed to mean to use numeric entities instead
         of named entities.  former effect is now always on.

Tue Aug 27 13:52:33 UTC 2019 - Dr. Werner Fink <werner@suse.de>

- Port the texinfo-zlib.patch to new version 6.6 to solve build problems 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug 27 07:03:03 UTC 2019 - Martin Pluskal <mpluskal@suse.com>

- Update to version 6.6:
  * Language:
    . new commands @&, @ampchar{}
    . @cropmarks command removed
    . @ctrl is no longer recognised (it was a way to insert literal
      control characters in Info files, but deprecated since the
      time of Texinfo version 2)
    . \usebracesinindexestrue is no longer recommended for using braces in
      index entries, and has been a no-op for some time
  * texi2any
    . extension modules fixed to work with the "thread-safe locales" of
      Perl 5.28 and newer
    . some code changed to stop warnings being given by newer versions of Perl
    . for HTML output, use `id' to define link targets instead of the `name'
      attribute on <a>
    . A native-code implementation of the Texinfo parser has been included
      on an experimental basis, which makes texi2any a lot faster.  Set the
      `TEXINFO_XS_PARSER' environment variable to 1 to use.
    . changes to HTML output:
      . omit colon after node name in menus by default (use
        `MENU_ENTRY_COLON' to add it back)
      . no special CSS for commands like @smallexample
      . new customization variable `SECTION_NAME_IN_TITLE' to use the
        section name as the document <title>
      . use section names instead of node names in generated menus
    . pass on flags set with -D to TeX
    . useless static libraries are not installed
    . the newline after an @insertcopying is not output
    . warning given for @multitable prototypes not in braces
    . @indent and @noindent are not allowed inside the arguments to
      commands where they are not meaningful
    . @quote-arg and @allow-recursion are not recognised (these two used
      to be recognised by makeinfo in macro definitions but were never
      implemented in texinfo.tex)
    . `FIX_TEXINFO' removed as a customization variable
    . do not recognise or warn about obsolete customization variables
  * info
    . debugging output with -x is not diverted to a separate infodebug file
  * Development:
    . switch from Subversion to git
      - https://savannah.gnu.org/git/?group=texinfo
    . automake 1.16
- Drop no longer needed patch:
  * perl-5.28-fixes.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec 11 11:49:21 UTC 2018 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Update perl-5.28-fixes.patch: Update locale handling for Perl 5.28.
  Perl 5.28 introduced thread-safe locales, where setlocale()
  only affects the locale of the current thread. External code
  like mbrtowc(3) isn't aware of this thread specific locale,
  so we need to explicitly modify the global one instead.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov 22 17:59:13 UTC 2018 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Use noun phrase for summaries.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct 30 13:15:15 UTC 2018 - Dr. Werner Fink <werner@suse.de>

  due broken perl API with perl 5.28 and up (boo#1113945)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr  6 09:02:47 UTC 2018 - adam.majer@suse.de

- install-info_exitcode.patch: install-info needs to return success
  when it does nothing. We need 0 return value even on failure as
  old packages in SLE-11 and SLE-12 can become uninstallable.
  (bsc#1084997)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan  4 14:18:03 UTC 2018 - mpluskal@suse.com

- Update to version 6.5:
  * info:
    + some bugs fixed:
      a bug where a segfault could happen in the regex search, for
      example when the user entered a single \ as the search string
    + another bug which could make nodes inaccessible in long
      "split" info files
    + a bug where it was not possible to follow a cross-reference
      that was split across more than one line has been fixed
    + do not fall back to a man page if following a cross-reference
      in an info file failed
    + if looking for a file failed, do not convert the name of a
      file to lower-case and look for it again
  * texinfo.tex
    + some faulty definitions for Unicode characters have been
      changed or removed
    + fix indentation in table of contents for entries that are
      split across multiple lines
  * texi2dvi
    + a bug that broke the processing of LaTeX files that did not
      use BibTeX has been fixed
  * texi2any
    + output the encoding declaration of a HTML file earlier so it
      will always occur within first 1024 bytes of file
    + `INLINE_INSERTCOPYING' removed as a customization variable

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct  9 07:20:30 UTC 2017 - werner@suse.de

- Avoid also provide libtool() on texinfo specific perl linkage

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Oct  7 12:35:18 UTC 2017 - coolo@suse.com

- Drop require on perl(Locale::Messages) as long as we bundle
  perl-libintl-perl (the system one leaves tests failing)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Oct  7 08:31:43 UTC 2017 - coolo@suse.com

- Do not provide perl() - the modules are not globally available
  (bsc#1062028)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct  4 08:41:08 UTC 2017 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Change perl requires to be exactly the perl version makeinfo was
  built against. We ship a perl loadable module which is hard
  linked to the right version.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul 12 12:48:12 UTC 2017 - mpluskal@suse.com

- Update to version 6.4:
  * texi2any:
    + for HTML output, place section names before the manual in page
      titles, instead of after them, so it is easier to distinguish pages
      if titles are truncated
    + starting points for ordered lists beginning with 0 or a letter of
      the alphabet are output as attributes on the <ol> tag, as was
      case for Texinfo 4.13 and earlier
    + a bit faster
    + some discrepancies in paragraph formatting between Perl extension
      modules and interpreted Perl modules have been fixed
    + `MACRO_BODY_IGNORES_LEADING_SPACE' customization variable removed,
      and `indent_menu_descriptions' is no longer a possible value for
      `TREE_TRANSFORMATIONS' (as these features did not work as
      documented)
  * info:
    + the `up-line' and `down-line' commands now are like the other
      scrolling commands and are no longer confined to a single node
      (depending on the value of `scroll-behaviour')
    + supplying the --all option with --index-search displays a list
      of matching index entries
    + the style variables like `link-style' can now be set while info
      is running
    + display bug fixed where color could be turned off prematurely
    + several other bugs fixed
    + better portability in test suite
    + do not fall back to showing the dir node if a manual isn't found
    + Do not attempt any kind of conversion of CR LF line endings,
      except on MS-DOS/Windows, when it is done unconditionally.  (This 
      replaces a more complicated approach, where this conversion would 
      take place if there was a problem finding a node in a file.)  The 
      main effect of this change is that Info files with CR LF line 
      endings, which would have been produced on MS-DOS/Windows with old 
      versions of makeinfo, are only supported on such operating systems.
    + a few of the key bindings under --vi-keys have been changed for
      consistency or to match the documentation
  * texinfo.tex
    + a DVI file with a single empty page can be output again, which
      restores the behavior from Texinfo 6.0 and earlier
- Small packaging clenup:
  * Drop conditions for old releases
  * Run spec-cleaner
  * Run testsuite

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan 20 10:02:38 UTC 2017 - rmaliska@suse.com

- Update to version 6.3:
  * Language:
    + The commands `@setcontentsaftertitlepage' and
      `@setshortcontentsaftertitlepage' have been removed.
    + @-commands are no longer supported within `@errormsg'.
  * texinfo.tex:
    + For a couple of characters (opening and closing braces), use glyphs
      from the standard TeX math fonts instead of using EC fonts which are 
      less likely to be installed.
    + Use of user-defined macros in the text of an index entry is more
      reliable when the text contains Texinfo @-commands.
    + @synindex and @syncodeindex have been fixed (broken in the last
      release).
    + Support added for native UTF-8 support with XeTeX and LuaTeX.
    + Support of PDF output with XeTeX improved.
    + You can use a new file doc/texinfo-ja.tex for Texinfo documents in
      Japanese.  doc/short-sample-ja.tex is a sample document.  New 
      support file doc/txi-ja.tex for Japanese.
    + texi2any:
    + Fix handling of compiler options when building Perl extension modules.
  * texi2dvi:
    + Can now process files whose absolute paths contain space characters,
      as long a relative path to the file is given.  Better support of 
      files with unusual characters in their names.
    + No longer exits prematurely in some circumstances (due to the script
      running under "set -e").
    + Bug fixed which made the `--command' and `--tidy' options
      incompatible.
  * info:
    + Handling of "invalid" value in infokey file fixed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jul 24 16:11:18 UTC 2016 - p.drouand@gmail.com

- Remove libpth-devel; texinfo doesn't depend on it

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul 15 18:05:00 UTC 2016 - schwab@linux-m68k.org

- Update to 6.1
  * Language:
    . You can now omit the @menu from nodes with other nodes below them in
      the document structure.  If you use "@validatemenus off" near the 
      start of a Texinfo file, makeinfo will, where needed, create a menu 
      for nodes lacking one given explicitly.
    . An @setfilename line is no longer required at the start of a
      Texinfo file.  (Be aware, though, that some other tools may require 
      it, for example Automake.)
    . For processing with TeX, a comma is automatically provided following
      a cross-reference command (such as @xref) when needed to separate
      the page number from following text, so you don't need to add one
      yourself.  See the `Parts of a Cross Reference' node in the manual
      for details.  Behavior when followed by punctuation, as always
      recommended previously, is unchanged.
  * texi2any:
    . Some Perl modules have been rewritten in C to increase speed.
      If Perl extensions can be created, they are used by default; 
      otherwise the pure Perl implementations are still used.
      Disable at build time with "configure --disable-perl-xs".  The 
      environment variable TEXINFO_XS controls how they are used by 
      texi2any.
    . Quotation marks are left out for node names and index entries in
      Info output where they would have been produced by commands such
      as @file or @option.
    . New customization variable INFO_SPECIAL_CHARS_QUOTE to allow use of
      a quoting mechanism for problematic constructs in Info output, for
      example node names containing colons or commas.
    . Commands like @heading are affected by @lowersections and @raisesections
      again, as was the case before Texinfo 5.0.
  * texinfo.tex:
    . You may explicitly specify a sort key for an index entry by preceding
      the text of the entry with the @sortas commmand with the sort key 
      desired as a braced argument.   Additionally, you may choose to
      ignore all occurences of the characters \, @, <, and - using new 
      flags you can specify with @set: `txiindexbackslashignore',
      `txiindexatsignignore', `txiindexlessthanignore', and
      `txiindexhyphenignore' respectively.
    . Changes to macro handling to more closely match makeinfo.  Ends of
      lines are preserved in an argument to a macro taking a single 
      argument.
    . By default, suppress heading line on a page with a chapter on it, to
      avoid having the chapter title repeated.
    . Use a larger font for arguments in a @deffn line and similar.
    . The default indices (cp, ky and so on) now don't get a file opened
      for them unless they are actually used.  This reduces the number of
      files that a run of TeX produces, and also allows for a greater
      number of user-defined indices, because you will not bump into TeX's
      limit of 16 open files at once so soon.
    . For initials in indices that are non-alphanumeric characters (for
      example, backslash, or braces), avoid use of a typewriter font.  
      This gives a more consistent appearance.
    . Have a stronger preference for breaking a column in an index before
      a letter heading.
    . Formatting improvements in tables of contents and indices.  Entries
      can extend slightly into the margin instead of being broken across 
      two lines, and text is split more evenly across lines.  Reduce 
      chance of an orphaned index entry appearing at the top of a column.
    . Support character encodings beyond ASCII for XeTeX and LuaTeX by
      reading file input byte-by-byte.
  * texi2dvi:
    . Support for determining the output files using the `-recorder'
      option to TeX, to help to support more TeX engines.
  * info:
    . New user variables `link-style', `active-link-style', and
      `match-style' enable customization of how cross-references and search 
      matches are highlighted.
    . By default only the node pointers are displayed at the top of a node.
      Customize this with the `nodeline' variable.
    . New command M-x tree-search to search all subnodes of a node.
    . Now tries to find referenced manuals in the same directory as the
      current file first, before looking in search path.  Customize this
      with new variable `follow-strategy'.
    . The `mouse' variable is now off by default, in order not to
      interfere with the selection of text in a terminal emulator window.
    . `q' closes a window instead of quitting altogether if there's more
      than one, for example if a help window is open.
    . Several bug fixes, including:
	. one causing the wrong position in a node to be shown when
	  following an "anchor" cross-reference
	. one causing a test failure in the t/c-u-m-x-scroll-forward.sh
	  test on some platforms
    . Internal changes to reduce memory use and increase speed of
      searches, relative to last release
    . The meaning of the `key-time' variable has changed when its value
      is 0.  This value meant to wait forever in the last release, but now
      it means that the next byte must be available immediately.
  * Documentation:
    . The `info.info' file (and `info.texi' source) is no longer
      distributed with Texinfo.  Now this manual is only in Emacs.

- Package info.info that is revert the previous drop from
  Mon May  6 16:05:29 UTC 2013

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul 15 11:13:20 UTC 2015 - werner@suse.de

- The package texinfo now requires makeinfo of the same version
  to make sure that the correct Texinfo.pm is installed 
- libzio is able to handle lz(ma) and xz files as well

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jul 11 10:14:57 UTC 2015 - mpluskal@suse.com

- Update to 6.0
  * Language:
    + new commands @sub and @sup, for textual subscripts and 
      superscripts.
    + new command @U to insert a Unicode character by code point.
  * texinfo.tex:
    + @url/@uref output in PDF now the same as in DVI, showing the 
      url even if the second argument is given, not just as a link 
      target. TeX option \urefurlonlylinktrue gives previous 
      behavior, of invisible urls.
    + PDF-only \linkcolor and \urlcolor specify colors (default 
      black).
  * texi2any:
    + customization variable TOP_NODE_UP_URL now replaces all (dir) 
      references; recommended setting for GNU packages is /manual/.
    + new customization variable INDEX_SPECIAL_CHARS_WARNING to 
      complain when index entries contain a colon.
    + Docbook output no longer uses <lineannotation> for @r.
    + -D'var val' on the command line works as intended again.
    + --plaintext output can be split.
    + a bit faster.
  * info:
    + invoking as `info foo bar' looks for bar as an index entry 
      in manual foo, if not found as a top-level menu item.
    + invoking info with an absolute or explicitly relative file 
      name (./foo.info, /tmp/foo.info, etc.) just visits that file.
    + separate `infokey' program has been removed - the .infokey 
      file is now read directly by Info.
    + new option --init-file allows overriding ~/.infokey.
    + new variable `highlight-searches' allows highlighting 
      results from a search
    + support for mouse scrollwheel, controlled by `mouse' 
      variable.
    + new variable `key_time' to control how long to wait for 
      byte sequences sent by special keys.
    + new variable `hide-note-references' alters appearance of 
      displayed nodes
    + new variable `infopath-no-defaults' allows omitting the 
      compile-time Info directory from the Info search path.
    + support input of multibyte characters for searches in 
      a UTF-8 locale.
    + if reading an Info file that is known to be in a different 
      character encoding to that of the user's environment, 
      convert its contents when displayed and substitute 
      missing characters
    + new command M-x info-version.
    + the M-x kill-node command has been removed.
    + test suite at build time.
  * texindex:
    + completely new implementation as a literate program using 
      Texinfo and (portable) awk (called TexiWeb Jr.).
    + the -o (--output) is not supported, unless we hear of 
      someone using it.
    + duplicated sort keys with different display texts result 
      in one merged index entry, using the first display text.
    + better sorting and parsing in unusual cases; most 
      notably, { and } characters can appear as initials.
  * install-info:
    + handle compressed input file names containing spaces.
    + exit successfully if --remove is given and the dir file 
      does not exist.
    + new option --defsection, to be used instead of 
      "Miscellaneous" when a section is not present in the Info 
      file.
  * texi2dvi:
    + look for the environment variable THUMBPDF_CMD instead of 
      THUMBPDF, since thumbpdf itself has used THUMBPDF for options 
      since 2000.
    + remove --recode and --recode-from options, since they haven't 
      worked as intended for years, so evidently no one needs them.

  makeinfo: since the switch to using the external ones, we also
  must ensure to have them present for the user to execute
  makeinfo. And makeinfo can be installed without texinfo (which
  already does require those modules too).

-------------------------------------------------------------------

  the users installing it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb  5 20:23:34 UTC 2015 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Completely splitt off texi2html and texi2roff into their own
  package containers. As a consequence, we no longer carry those
  files / patches here (they live in their respective other
  packages): texi2html-1.78.dif, texi2html-5.0.tar.bz2,
  texi2html-5584.patch, texi2html.changes, texi2html.spec,
  texi2roff-2.0-gcc4.patch, texi2roff-2.0.dif, texi2roff-2.0.tar.gz,

    produce all supported output formats, both those from texi2dvi
    (PDF/DVI) and from makeinfo (Info/HTML/etc.).  texi2any and
    makeinfo are now different names for the same program; there
    are no differences in behavior based on the program name.

- Add provides for texi2html and texi2roff (bnc#469300)
- Update to texi2html 1.82 (2009-01-05)
  * Add new hooks for user functions, for simple @-commands, and at the start and
    end of special regions.
  * Don't use unidecode on unicode characters that are known not to have a good
    transliteration.  This corresponds with characters with an @-command that
    don't have a transliteration, like @exclamdown...
  * handle @alias, @quote*, @guillem*, @textdegree, @allowcodebreaks,
    @fonttextsize, @hyphenation, @click, @clickstyle, @click, @arrow, 
    @clicksequence, @geq, @leq, @*headingmarks, @*footingmarks, @smallquotation,
    @ogonek.
    Handle @columnfractions and row prototypes in @multitable better.
  * @documentlanguage is used to set the language each time it is seen (except
    if the language was set on the command line).
  * new option --css-ref, generate reference to a CSS URL.
  * new option --transliterate-file-names, produce file names in ASCII 
    transliteration (set in the default case).
  * --no-monolithic is reenabled.
  * @, followed by an argument without brace is now handled. Report from 
    Jorge Barros de Abreu.
  * @, is kept with --macro-expand.
  * @math is more compatible with makeinfo/texi2dvi when no external program
    is used. Using tex4ht for html generation should also lead to a correct
    result.
  * Handle right @end block commands followed by something else than a 
    spacing character.
  * Remove trailing end of line in @html block.
  * @itemize should produce bullets by default. Report from Reinhold Kainhofer.
  * handle frame files like other files. Report from Reinhold Kainhofer.
- Update to texinfo 4.13a (18 September 2008)
  * A reference card for Texinfo is now available, in doc/refcard.  For
    convenience, preformatted PDF's for letter-size and A4 paper are included.
  * makeinfo:
    . new option --internal-links for HTML output, to write a tsv file
      mapping indexed/toc terms to links, for easy reference from external
      documents.
    . - as an input file name reads standard input. 
  * info:
    . support for multibyte encodings such as UTF-8.
    . new option --show-malformed-multibytes, to display malformed multibyte
    sequences.
    . new environment variable INFO_MAN_COMMAND sets the name of man binary
    (use it if you a need to override PATH settings).
  * install-info:
    . bug fix: support names with embedded periods (e.g., config.status) again.
  * Distribution:
    . autoconf 2.63.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jun 15 13:50:57 CEST 2008 - schwab@suse.de

- Update to texinfo 4.12.
  * Language:
    . new commands @clicksequence, @click, and @clickstyle for documenting
      GUI sequences, and @arrow for the default glyph used.
    . new commands @geq{} and @leq{} for the normal >= and <= relations.
  * install-info:
    . lzma compression supported.
    . Much work towards compatibility with Debian's independent
      implementation.  Changes in behavior:
      - new entries are formatted to start at column 34 by default.
      - existing entries are replaced by default.
      - new sections are alphabetized among existing sections.
      - if an entry being removed is the last one in a section, the
	section is also removed.
    . Also many new options:
      --section REGEX TITLE.
      --no-indent: disable formatting of new entries.
      --menuentry, --name: specify left-hand side of an entry.
      --dry-run: alias for --test.
      --regex REGEX: renamed from --section regex, adds to all sections
	matching REGEX by default.
      --add-once: add only to first specified or matching section.
      --align COL: start description at column COL.
      --calign COL: start continuation lines in description at COL.
      --max-width COL: wrap the description at COL.
    . New section in the Texinfo manual describing all this.
  * Info:
    Our goal with these changes to the default interface is to make Info
    documents more easily and quickly readable, especially by non-experts.
    . the PageUp and PageDown keys move through the whole document by
      default, instead of just the current node.
    . the h command shows the basic help, and H starts the Info tutorial.
    . the newly-bound x command deletes the current window, e.g., within help.
    . the scroll-step variable is set to 1 by default, for smooth scrolling.
    . the cursor-movement-scrolls-p variable is set to 1 by default, so
      link searches look through the whole document.
    . regular expression searches are supported, and are the default for
      both regular and incremental searches.
    . the new R command toggles between regexp and literal-string searches.
    . the new variable scroll-last-node controls scrolling at the end of
      the last node; by default, it now simply reports there are no more
      nodes.  To restore the old behavior, set scroll-last-node=Scroll.
    . the precise line number specified in index entries is used if available.
    . --usage=info shows usage for standalone Info.
    . lzma compression supported.
  * Distribution:
    . language support for no removed/renamed to nb, per Norwegian translators.
    . new translation: es.
    . bug fixes in make check (and elsewhere).
    . gettext 0.17, automake 1.10.1, autoconf 2.62.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 10 13:33:18 CET 2008 - werner@suse.de

- Update to texinfo version 4.11 (4.10 was omitted)
 * Language:
   . @documentlanguage now supports an optional country code
     specification after the language code, a la gettext.
   . new command @allowcodebreaks controls breaks at _ and - within @code.
   . new command @frenchspacing controls spacing after sentences.
   . new command @fonttextsize allows changing body text font size to 10pt.
   . new command @textdegree{} produces the normal degrees symbol.
   . new command @thischapternum can be used in TeX headers/footers.
   . new commands for quotes: @quotedblleft @quotedblright
      @quoteleft @quoteright  @quotedblbase @quotesinglbase
      @guillemetleft @guillemetright @guilsinglleft @guilsinglright.
   . new option @set txicodequoteundirected produces an undirected quote
     in code and example output, instead of the regular right quote.
   . new option @set txicodequotebacktick produces a grave accent in
     code and example output, instead of the regular left quote.
 * makeinfo:
   . The @documentlanguage locale is used to translate various document strings.
   . --enable-encoding is now the default, meaning Info and plain text
     output use 8-bit characters given a supported @documentencoding.
   . new option --css-ref=URL for creating a stylesheet <link> in HTML output.
   . new option --transliterate-file-names to use a reduction-to-ASCII
     algorithm for split HTML file names, useful for non-Latin-based languages.
   . @enddots{} outputs three dots instead of four, for consistency with
     texinfo.tex.
   . the Local Variables coding: setting written by --enable-encoding now
     comes at the very end, after the tags table, so that Emacs can find
     it in more cases.
   . @allow-recursion (never documented) is deprecated and produces a warning.
   . @quote-args (never documented) is now the default behavior.
   . centering and such take account of character widths.
   . the --reference-limit option is now a no-op.
   . improvements to XML and Docbook output and the DTD.
 * texinfo.tex:
   . @thissection can now be used in custom headings, and @thischapter
     works reliably even without @set chapternewpage.  Custom headings
     have additional flexibility as well.
 * texi2dvi:
   . pdftexi2dvi is a new wrapper to `texi2dvi --pdf', equal to texi2pdf,
     for the sake of AUC-TeX which prepends `pdf' to the compilation
     command when requested to produce PDF.
 * info:
   . look for info files in the current directory first, by default.
   . when calling man, use -a if no explicit section is found.
   . avoid showing the top(1) man page for nonexistent info files.
 * install-info:
   . new options --section-regex, --remove-exactly, --debug, --test.
 * Distribution:
   . autoconf 2.60, automake 1.10, gettext 0.16.1.
   . gettext support now [external].
   . new translations: hu (Hungarian), rw (Kinyarwandan), vi (Vietnamese).
   . most common sources imported from gnulib.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul 11 13:13:29 CEST 2007 - werner@suse.de

- Update to texinfo version 4.9
  * GPLv3.
  * texi2dvi:
    . new mode --build=tidy which supports compilation in a separate
      directory, where intermediate files are preserved.
    . new option --build-dir, to specify where the tidy build will take
      place, either locally or globally.  This allows avoiding the clutter
      while preserving auxiliary files.
    . new support for AUC-TeX: texi2dvi (weakly) supports arguments a la
      TeX such as `\nonstopmode\input{file.tex}'.
      . new options --ps and --dvipdf, useful especially for pstricks documents.
    . new option --src-specials, passed to TeX.
    . pdftexi2dvi is a new wrapper to `texi2dvi --pdf', equal to texi2pdf,
      for the sake of AUC-TeX which prepends `pdf' to the compilation
      command when requested to produce PDF.
  * texinfo.tex:
    . Latin1, Latin2, Latin9, and UTF-8 are supported as well as Computer
      Modern can manage.
    . png and jpg images supported in pdf output.
    . new Russian, Serbian, and Ukrainian translations for texinfo.tex:
      txi-ru.tex, txi-sr.tex, txi-uk.tex.
    . section names with \ characters work properly in pdf outlines.
    . have .toc files use @ as the escape character, instead of \.
- Update to texi2html version 1.78
  * Transliterate accented characters in file names. Use Text::Unidecode
    if detected.
  * Handle @frenchspacing, @tie, @indent, @setcontentsaftertitlepage,
    @setshortcontentsaftertitlepage and the obsolete @allow-recursion 
    and @quote-arg.
  * With book style the Table of Contents is put where it is set.
  * Use more numeric entities, especially for accented letters.
  * The `examples' directory now contains an init file for Mediawiki output.
    Mediawiki is the GPL'd wiki used by Wikipedia.
  * new init file tex4ht.init. With this init file, httex or htlatex from 
    tex4ht is used to format @tex and @math.
  * Init files now have a chance to override all file names, rather than just
    page names.
  * Put the images under a double licence by adding back their original GPL
    licence.
  * If SIMPLE_MENU is true the menu is simply enclosed in a preformatted 
    environment.
  * The user can bypass the texi2html functions and provide his own function
    to do things similar that what is done for interfacing with LaTeX2HTML
    or tex4ht.
  * LaTeX2HTML stuff is moved out of texi2html.pl, to T2h_l2h.pm.
  * Add $USER and $DATE variables to override the defaults detected for the
    footer.
  * $TOP_FILE and $TOC_FILE are only set if set by the user. The elements
    file names are in the hash reference $Texi2HTML::THISDOC{'filename'}
    for use in init files.
  * The API for image, normal_text, paragraph and node_file_name has changed.
  * The $ENCODING variable is deprecated, replaced by $ENCODING_NAME
    and $OUT_ENCODING.
  * utf8 is used as default out file encoding. This should allow for utf8
    translations for languages which cannot use @-commands for non ascii
    characters.
  * Use entities for ``, '', ---, -- and quotes used for some formatting
    @-commands if $USE_ISO is set. 
  * don't set unset MENU-ENTRY-NAME if it is similar with the NODE-NAME,
    it is useless as it is a construct that shouldn't happen.
  * avoid menu entry and description redundancy in the formatting function
    and not in the main program.
  * accept - in @-command names (compatibility with makeinfo)
  * in user-defined macro arguments a comma in brace is escaped (compatibility
    with makeinfo from texinfo 4.8.90)
  * don't add the section title to the html title when the document isn't split
  * When the file extension is set to the empty string, a trailing `.' will not
    be automatically added to file names.
  * The texi2html script is now created by make and not configure. 
  * It is possible to build the translation files from outside of the 
    build directory.
  * When configure detects that no Data::Dumper is present, the build scripts
    will simply copy the files instead of breaking.
  * remove handling of quotation second arg, quotation has only one arg.
  * handle nested ifset/ifclear.
  * Improved handling of @sc and @centerchap.
  * More flexible normal_text.
  * style_stack really contains the formatting @-commands. 
  * caching of html generated by latex2html reenabled.
  * when not split and no section navigation is output, the about page and
    navigation direction are not output for all the elements.
