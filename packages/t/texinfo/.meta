  <title>Tools Needed to Create Documentation from Texinfo Sources</title>
  <description>Texinfo is a documentation system that uses a single source file to
produce both online information and printed output.  Using Texinfo, you
can create a printed document with the normal features of a book,
including chapters, sections, cross-references, and indices.  From the
same Texinfo source file, you can create a menu-driven, online info
file with nodes, menus, cross-references, and indices using the included
makeinfo tool.

Aggregated with texinfo in this package is texi2html and texi2roff.</description>
