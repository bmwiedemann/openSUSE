- bsc#1207959: Install binaries and scripts under %tcl_archdir
- Obsoletes install-libraries-libdir.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 14 11:14:27 UTC 2022 - Ferdinand Thiessen <rpm@fthiessen.de>

- Update to 0.9.2
  * Added tdom::schema command.
  * Added -onlyContents and -breakLines to asHTML.
  * Added -indent value "tab" to asXML and asJSON.
  * User configurable separator character between namespace URI
    and local name for XML namespace-aware SAX parser:  Added the
    option -namespaceseparator to the expat command.
  * Added method clearString to the dom command.
  * Updated tested expat to 2.2.9.
  * Changed the license to MPL 2.0.
- Update to 0.9.1
  * The package name is tDOM, but it always has been requested by
    [package require tdom] and now the scripted helper commands in
    tdom.tcl are also in the namespace tdom (not anymore in tDOM).
    The new pullparser command is now also in this namespace.
    There are aliases from the old command names to the new one,
    so there must be nothing done; old scripts will run as they
    did.
  * Added new method attributeNames to domNode (cmds).
  * Added new methods line and column to most pull parser states.
  * More fine grain control about serialization details: new asXML
    options -nogtescape and -noEmptyElementTag.
  * Fixed a potentially dramatic speed problem in case of certain
    classes of XPath expressions if a threads enabled tDOM is
    used, the result set is large and the DOM tree to query was
    altered somewhere before the query by an operation, which
    appended, inserted or replaced a node.
  * Added command tDOM::pullparser, with creates simple XML "pull"
    parser commands.
  * New flag -keepCDATA for [dom parse ...].
- Update to 0.9.0
  * New feature "creating real FQ nodes with *fromScript methods",
    by adding option -namespace to [dom createNodeCmd].
  * Removed hacky check on [load] time if the tclsh and tDOM are
    build with incompatible TCL_UTF_MAX (because it did not work
    anymore with recent tcl because of changes in core).
  * Added JSON support. New -json option to [dom parse].
  * Added HTM5 parser (new -html5 option to [dom parse]).
  * Added options -xmlDeclaration and -encString to the asXML
    method of the domDoc and domNode commands.
  * Improved handling of characters beyond BMP. 
  * Added dom method featureinfo.
  * Raised the limit of maximum number of different XML
    namespaceses within one DOM tree to 2^31.
