  <title>A XML/DOM/XPath/XSLT Implementation for Tcl</title>
  <description>tDOM combines high performance XML data processing with easy and
powerful Tcl scripting functionality. tDOM should be one of the fastest
ways to manipulate XML with a scripting language and uses very few
memory: for example, the DOM tree of the XML recommendation in XML
(160K) needs only about 450K of memory.</description>
