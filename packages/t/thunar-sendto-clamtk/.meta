  <title>Adds a right-click, context menu to scan files or folders in Thunar</title>
  <description>All this plugin does is copy a desktop file to Thunar's send-to
directory.  If this seems redundant, that's because it is:
this plugin depends on clamtk, which already has this directory
file. So, it stands to reason we should be able to just find that
file and copy it, rather than having our own copy.
