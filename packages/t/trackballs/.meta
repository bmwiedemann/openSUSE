  <description>Trackballs is a simple game similar to the classic game Marble Madness on the Amiga in the 80's. The player collects points by steering a marble ball through a labyrinth filled with vicious hammers, pools of acid, and other obstacles.

When the ball reaches the destination you continue on to the next, more difficult level - unless, of course, the time runs out.

You steer the ball using the mouse and by pressing space, you can jump a short distance.

When all levels are finished, an editor mode permits you to create new ones (&quot;trackballs -e&quot;).</description>
