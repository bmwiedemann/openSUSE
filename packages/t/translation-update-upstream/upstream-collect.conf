# osc repositories with packages (space separated list in parentheses, first takes precedence)
# It typically consists of an array of following repositories (in this order):
# - proposed-translation-fixes repository with yet unreleased changes (if exists; such repo allows us to create a tarball update for translation-update package without rebuild)
# - latest patchlevel packages sources (if exists)
# - the original gold master (GA) package sources

# OSC_REPOSITORIES array index of the main (fully rebuilt with current translation-update-upstream) repository (starts with 0).
# It is typically 0 for Factory based products, 1 for products where 0 is a proposed-translation-fixes repo, 2 for products which are not fully rebuilt before release where 1 represents patchlevel repository.

# OSC_REPOSITORIES array index of the repository with proposed translation updates that don't appear in the main product (starts with 0). Keep empty if there is no such repository.
# It is typically empty for Factory based products, otherwise it points to an unreleased proposed-translation-fixes repository with index 0.
