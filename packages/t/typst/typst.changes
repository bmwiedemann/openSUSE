-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 18 08:51:12 UTC 2024 - Martin Sirringhaus <martin.sirringhaus@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.11.0
  * Tables
    - Tables are now _much_ more flexible, read the new
      [table guide]($guides/table-guide) to get started
    - Added [`table.cell`] element for per-cell configuration
    - Cells can now span multiple [columns]($table.cell.colspan) or
      [rows]($table.cell.rowspan)
    - The [stroke]($table.cell.stroke) of individual cells can now be customized
    - The [`align`]($table.align) and [`inset`]($table.inset) arguments of the
      table function now also take `{(x, y) => ..}` functions
    - Added [`table.hline`] and [`table.vline`] for convenient line customization
    - Added [`table.header`] element for table headers that repeat on every page
    - Added [`table.footer`] element for table footers that repeat on every page
    - All the new table functionality is also available for [grids]($grid)
    - Fixed gutter-related bugs
  * Templates
    - You can now use template packages to get started with new projects. Click
      _Start from template_ on the web app's dashboard and choose your preferred
      template or run the `typst init <template>` command in the CLI. You can
      [browse the available templates here]($universe/search/?kind=templates).
    - Switching templates after the fact has become easier. You can just import a
      styling function from a different template package.
    - Package authors can now submit their own templates to the
      [package repository](https://github.com/typst/packages). Share a template
      for a paper, your institution, or an original work to help the community get
      a head start on their projects.
    - Templates and packages are now organized by category and discipline. Filter
      packages by either taxonomy in the _Start from template_ wizard. If you are
      a package author, take a look at the new documentation for
      [categories](https://github.com/typst/packages/blob/main/CATEGORIES.md) and
      [disciplines](https://github.com/typst/packages/blob/main/DISCIPLINES.md).
  * Context
    - Added _context expressions:_ Read the chapter on [context] to get started
    - With context, you can access settable properties, e.g. `{context text.lang}`
      to access the language set via `{set text(lang: "..")}`
    - The following existing functions have been made contextual: [`query`],
      [`locate`], [`measure`], [`counter.display`], [`counter.at`],
      [`counter.final`], [`state.at`], and [`state.final`]
    - Added contextual methods [`counter.get`] and [`state.get`] to retrieve the
      value of a counter or state in the current context
    - Added contextual function [`here`] to retrieve the [location] of the current
      context
    - The [`locate`] function now returns the location of a selector's unique
      match. Its old behavior has been replaced by context expressions and only
      remains temporarily available for compatibility.
    - The [`counter.at`] and [`state.at`] methods are now more flexible: They
      directly accept any kind of [locatable]($location/#locatable) selector with
      a unique match (e.g. a label) instead of just locations
    - When context is available, [`counter.display`] now directly returns the
      result of applying the numbering instead of yielding opaque content. It
      should not be used anymore without context. (Deprecation planned)
    - The [`state.display`] function should not be used anymore, use [`state.get`]
      instead (Deprecation planned)
    - The `location` argument of [`query`], [`counter.final`], and
      [`state.final`] should not be used anymore (Deprecation planned)
    - The [`styles`]($measure.styles) argument of the `measure` function should
      not be used anymore (Deprecation planned)
    - The [`style`] function should not be used anymore, use context instead
      (Deprecation planned)
    - The correct context is now also provided in various other places where it is
      available, e.g. in show rules, layout callbacks, and numbering functions
      in the outline
  * Styling
    - Fixed priority of multiple [show-set rules]($styling/#show-rules): They now
      apply in the same order as normal set rules would
    - Show-set rules on the same element
      (e.g. `{show heading.where(level: 1): set heading(numbering: "1.")}`) now
      work properly
    - Setting properties on an element within a transformational show rule (e.g.
      `{show heading: it => { set heading(..); it }}`) is **not** supported
      anymore (previously it also only worked sometimes); use show-set rules
      instead (**Breaking change**)
    - Text show rules that match their own output now work properly
      (e.g. `` {show "cmd": `cmd`} ``)
    - The elements passed to show rules and returned by queries now contain all
      fields of their respective element functions rather than just specific ones
    - All settable properties can now be used in [where]($function.where)
      selectors
    - [And]($selector.and) and [or]($selector.or) selectors can now be used with
      show rules
    - Errors within show rules and context expressions are now ignored in all but
      the last introspection iteration, in line with the behavior of the old
      [`locate`]
    - Fixed a bug where document set rules were allowed after content
  * Layout
    - Added `reflow` argument to [`rotate`]($rotate) and [`scale`]($scale) which
      lets them affect the layout
    - Fixed a bug where [floating placement]($place.float) or
      [floating figures]($figure.placement) could end up out of order
    - Fixed overlap of text and figure for full-page floating figures
    - Fixed various cases where the [`hide`] function didn't hide its contents
      properly
    - Fixed usage of [`h`] and [`v`] in [stacks]($stack)
    - Invisible content like a counter update will no longer force a visible
      block for just itself
    - Fixed a bug with horizontal spacing followed by invisible content (like a
      counter update) directly at the start of a paragraph
  * Text
    - Added [`stroke`]($text.stroke) property for text
    - Added basic i18n for Serbian and Catalan
    - Added support for contemporary Japanese [numbering] method
    - Added patches for various wrong metadata in specific fonts
    - The [text direction]($text.dir) can now be overridden within a paragraph
    - Fixed Danish [smart quotes]($smartquote)
    - Fixed font fallback next to a line break

    - Fixed Finnish translation of "Listing"
    - Fixed Z-ordering of multiple text decorations (underlines, etc.)
    - Fixed a bug due to which text [features]($text.features) could not be
      overridden in consecutive set rules
  * Model
    - Added [`depth`]($heading.depth) and [`offset`]($heading.offset) arguments to
      heading to increase or decrease the heading level for a bunch of content;
      the heading syntax now sets `depth` rather than `level`
      (**Breaking change**)
    - List [markers]($list.marker) now cycle by default
    - The [`quote`] function now more robustly selects the correct quotes based on
      language and nesting
    - Fixed indent bugs related to the default show rule of [terms]
  * Math
    - Inline equations now automatically linebreak at appropriate places
    - Added [`number-align`]($math.equation.number-align) argument to equations
    - Added support for adjusting the [`size`]($math.accent.size) of accents

    - Added [`array.chunks`] method
    - A module can now be converted to a dictionary with the
      [dictionary constructor]($dictionary/#constructor) to access its contents
      dynamically

    - Fixed APA bibliography ordering
  * Drawing additions
    - Added polygon function for drawing polygons
    - Added support for clipping in boxes and blocks
  * Command line interface
    - Now returns with non-zero status code if there is an error
    - Now watches the root directory instead of the current one
    - Now puts the PDF file next to input file by default
    - Now accepts more kinds of input files (e.g. /dev/stdin)
    - Added --open flag to directly open the PDF
  * Miscellaneous improvements
    - Added yaml function to load data from YAML files
    - Added basic i18n for a few more languages (IT, RU, ZH, FR, PT)
    - Added numbering support for Hebrew
    - Added support for integers with base 2, 8, and 16
    - Added symbols for double bracket and laplace operator
    - The link function now accepts labels
    - The link syntax now allows more characters
    - Improved justification of Japanese and Chinese text
    - Calculation functions behave more consistently w.r.t to non-real results
    - Replaced deprecated angle brackets
    - Reduced maximum function call depth from 256 to 64
    - Fixed first-line-indent not being applied when a paragraph starts with styled text
    - Fixed extraneous spacing in unary operators in equations
    - Fixed block spacing, e.g. in {block(above: 1cm, below: 1cm, ..)}
    - Fixed styling of text operators in math
    - Fixed invalid parsing of language tag in raw block with a single backtick
    - Fixed bugs with displaying counters and state
    - Fixed crash related to page counter
    - Fixed crash when symbol function was called without arguments
    - Fixed crash in bibliography generation
    - Fixed access to label of certain content elements
    - Fixed line number in error message for CSV parsing
    - Fixed invalid autocompletion after certain markup elements
  * Versioning changes: Starting with this release, Typst follows semver. The language and compiler will be version together for now.
    As a result, all crates and the language share the same version and a breaking change to either the language or any library requires a version bump.
    Once the language stabilizes (unclear when), the compiler and language version might start to diverge as the compiler APIs will probably remain unstable.
