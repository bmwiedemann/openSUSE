- Update to version 0.1.0 
  * Breaking changes:
    - When using the CLI, you now have to use subcommands:
          typst compile file.typ or typst c file.typ to create a PDF
          typst watch file.typ or typst w file.typ to compile and watch
          typst fonts to list all fonts
    - Manual counters now start at zero. Read the "How to step" section in the counter documentation for more details
    - The bibliography styles "author-date" and "author-title" were renamed to "chicago-author-date" and "chicago-author-title"
  * Figure improvements
    - Figures now automatically detect their content and adapt their behaviour. Figures containing tables, for instance, are automatically prefixed with "Table X" and have a separate counter
    - The figure's supplement (e.g. "Figure" or "Table") can now be customized
    - In addition, figures can now be completely customized because the show rule gives access to the automatically resolved kind, supplement, and counter
  * Bibliography improvements
    - The bibliography function now also accepts multiple bibliography paths (as an array)
    - Parsing of BibLaTeX files is now more permissive (accepts non-numeric edition, pages, volumes, dates, and Jabref-style comments; fixed abbreviation parsing)
    - Labels and references can now include : and . except at the end
    - Fixed APA bibliography ordering
  * Drawing additions
    - Added polygon function for drawing polygons
    - Added support for clipping in boxes and blocks
  * Command line interface
    - Now returns with non-zero status code if there is an error
    - Now watches the root directory instead of the current one
    - Now puts the PDF file next to input file by default
    - Now accepts more kinds of input files (e.g. /dev/stdin)
    - Added --open flag to directly open the PDF
  * Miscellaneous improvements
    - Added yaml function to load data from YAML files
    - Added basic i18n for a few more languages (IT, RU, ZH, FR, PT)
    - Added numbering support for Hebrew
    - Added support for integers with base 2, 8, and 16
    - Added symbols for double bracket and laplace operator
    - The link function now accepts labels
    - The link syntax now allows more characters
    - Improved justification of Japanese and Chinese text
    - Calculation functions behave more consistently w.r.t to non-real results
    - Replaced deprecated angle brackets
    - Reduced maximum function call depth from 256 to 64
    - Fixed first-line-indent not being applied when a paragraph starts with styled text
    - Fixed extraneous spacing in unary operators in equations
    - Fixed block spacing, e.g. in {block(above: 1cm, below: 1cm, ..)}
    - Fixed styling of text operators in math
    - Fixed invalid parsing of language tag in raw block with a single backtick
    - Fixed bugs with displaying counters and state
    - Fixed crash related to page counter
    - Fixed crash when symbol function was called without arguments
    - Fixed crash in bibliography generation
    - Fixed access to label of certain content elements
    - Fixed line number in error message for CSV parsing
    - Fixed invalid autocompletion after certain markup elements
  * Versioning changes: Starting with this release, Typst follows semver. The language and compiler will be version together for now.
    As a result, all crates and the language share the same version and a breaking change to either the language or any library requires a version bump.
    Once the language stabilizes (unclear when), the compiler and language version might start to diverge as the compiler APIs will probably remain unstable.
