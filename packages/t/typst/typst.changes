    - Now puts the PDF file next to input file by default
    - Now accepts more kinds of input files (e.g. /dev/stdin)
    - Added --open flag to directly open the PDF
  * Miscellaneous improvements
    - Added yaml function to load data from YAML files
    - Added basic i18n for a few more languages (IT, RU, ZH, FR, PT)

  * Versioning changes: Starting with this release, Typst follows semver. The language and compiler will be version together for now.
    As a result, all crates and the language share the same version and a breaking change to either the language or any library requires a version bump.
    Once the language stabilizes (unclear when), the compiler and language version might start to diverge as the compiler APIs will probably remain unstable.
