- Update to version 0.8.0:
  + Report contacts with unknown presence as 'unknown' rather than
    raising an error, and don't crash if libpurple reports a
    "primitive status" that we don't understand (fdo#69474).
  + Fix a memory leak when IM channels are closed (fdo#31723).
  + Fix ContactGroups.SetContactGroups() implementation so it

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep 17 18:22:50 UTC 2013 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 0.7.1:
  + This is a release candidate for telepathy-haze 0.8, recommended
    for use with GNOME 3.10.

    support. Anyone relying on Haze for audio/video calling is
    invited to port it to Call1.
  + Enhancements: Support interactive password prompting for
    protocols like SIPE that have an optional password (fdo#63326).
  + Fixes:
    - Adapt to Sametime accounts getting a "usersplit" in libpurple
      2.10.1 (fdo#44631).
    - Regression test improvements (fdo#69269, fdo#65290,

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jul  9 18:38:25 CEST 2011 - vuntz@opensuse.org

- Update to version 0.5.0:
  + Enhancements:
    - fdo#19902: use TpBaseContactList to implement
      Conn.I.ContactList, Conn.I.ContactGroups, and the stored list
    - fdo#37933: implement contact blocking
    - fdo#13124: support setting your own alias
    - The Telepathy API to allow the user not to save their
      password is now implemented.
  + Fixes:
    - haze no longer ships with a manager file.
    - Map PURPLE_CONNECTION_ERROR_OTHER_ERROR to
      AuthenticationFailed, since it's used for errors like being
      temporarily banned from the ICQ server, which should result
      in Mission Control not trying to reconnect.
    - fdo#31846: translate the Jabber connection_security parameter
      in newer libpurple versions into two booleans, old-ssl and
      require-encryption.
    - fdo#26155: make telepathy-glib criticals fatal by default
    - fdo#30594: don't claim that ICQ (and other) contacts support
      audio calls when they aren't even supported at all by
      libpurple on the protocol.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug  6 04:15:22 CEST 2010 - vuntz@opensuse.org

- Update to version 0.4.0:
  + Fixes:
    - fdo#23702: use uint16 for port numbers, and be permissive
      about minor type variations in what we're actually given

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul 23 08:36:51 CEST 2010 - vuntz@opensuse.org

- Update to version 0.3.6:
  + Fixes:
    - Removing a group no longer removes all the contacts in that
      group from your contact list; instead, they're placed in a
      default group. (fdo#21294).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul  5 17:06:52 CEST 2010 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 0.3.5:
  + Enhancements:
    - The Capabilities interface is now supported even when media
      is disabled, so contacts get text caps.
    - The properties on the Avatars interface, added all the way
      back in spec 0.17.22, are now implemented.
    - fdo#28469: The “sipe” username is now correctly exposed as
      two parameters, “account” and “login”, rather than the user
      being required to combine the two with a comma in one field.
  + Fixes:
    - fdo#23542: The default character set is no longer forced to
      UTF-8; libpurple's default is respected. This works out
      better on ICQ, where most people who haven't thought about it
      use ISO-8859-1.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Mar  6 11:56:17 CET 2010 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 0.3.4:
  + Fixes:
    - Use the well-known Telepathy names for hidden and xa statuses
      to fix interoperability with Empathy, in particular the
      ability to be invisible on Haze accounts
    - Report the "loubserp-mxit" prpl as "mxit".
    - Rename prpl-simple to the standard Telepathy protocol name
      'sip'.
    - Be sure to link to glib and gobject, and fix typo when
      linking to dbus-glib, to ensure. Fixes fd.o#25124.
  + Enhancements:
    - Implement the new draft mail notification spec
    - Implement streamed media. Fixes fd.o#24385. (Maiku)
- BuildRequire libxslt-devel

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan 26 17:32:44 CET 2010 - vuntz@opensuse.org

- Update to version 0.3.3:
  + Fixes:
    - The secret connection parameters are now exposed as being
      secret in the manager file and also when the CM is
      introspected. This fixes fdo#24067.
    - Fix bug report URL for current bugzilla layout.
    - Fix circular channel creation.
  + Enhancements:
    - Start outputting debug messages on the Telepathy Debug
      interface by using telepathy-glib's TpDebugSender.
    - Stop using shave and allow use of automake 1.11's silent
      rules feature.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug 26 10:27:52 CEST 2009 - vuntz@novell.com

- Update to version 0.3.2:
  + Fixes:
    - Yahoo! Japan-specific parameters are no longer listed for the
      'yahoo' protocol in haze.manager. This fixes bgo#591381. If
      you're using libpurple 2.6.0 or later, 'yahoojp' will be
      available as a separate protocol.
    - The "busy" status is exposed as Busy rather than as Away.
      This fixes fdo#23441.
    - Haze now fails gracefully rather than asserting if you try to
      connect to MSN and your libpurple was built without SSL
      support. Fixes fdo#22800.
  + Enhancements:
    - The Facebook protocol plugin is now special-cased to have a
      sensible name in the Telepathy API. It seems to work with
      Empathy 2.27.91 if you delete haze.manager (which will no
      longer be shipped in a future release when stable releases of
      clients support it being absent).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul 20 09:40:41 CEST 2009 - vuntz@novell.com

- Use libexecdir instead of libdir in the file list to fix build.

      Contacts interfaces.
    - Text channels implement the Messages and Destroyable
      interfaces.
    - Add a test suite.
  + Fixes:
    - Text channels closed with pending messages now respawn.
      (fdo#17842)
    - Compiles without warnings on AMD64. (fdo#18513)
    - No longer asserts if you try to set the alias for someone not
      on your contact list. (fdo#17382)
    - Doesn't crash if you try to open a second connection to the
      same account. (fdo#18361)
- Don't setup CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS to default values.
- Use makeinstall.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Oct 19 11:53:40 EST 2008 - mboman@suse.de

- Update to version 0.2.1:
  + A publish channel now exists, which allows you to accept or decline
    incoming subscription requests (but nothing else yet; it's not possible
    to later remove someone from the list, for instance).
  + Add support for setting your avatar (fdo#13123).
  + Stop your accounts auto-awaying themselves (fdo#14335).
  + Don't crash when the UI passes an empty or otherwise invalid host name
    as the server parameter for a new connection (fdo#14445).
  + Don't sporadically crash on connection errors, such as an incorrect
    password (fdo#14933).
  + Debugging output from Haze and libpurple is now silenced unless you set
    HAZE_DEBUG appropriately ("haze" and "purple", respectively).
