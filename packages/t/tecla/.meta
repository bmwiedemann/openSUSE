  <title>Interactive command line editing library</title>
  <description>The tecla library provides UNIX and LINUX programs with interactive
command line editing facilities, similar to those of the UNIX tcsh
shell. In addition to simple command-line editing, it supports recall
of previously entered command lines, TAB completion of file names or
other tokens, and in-line wild-card expansion of filenames. The
internal functions which perform file-name completion and wild-card
expansion are also available externally for optional use by programs.
