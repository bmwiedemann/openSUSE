  <title>Centralized Logging for the Telepathy Framework</title>
  <description>tp-logger is a headless Observer client that logs information received by the
Telepathy framework. It features pluggable backends to log different sorts of
messages, in different formats.

tp-logger features a Telepathy-style D-Bus API to expose logs and interesting
information related to logging (most frequent contacts, etc.). It also provides
a GLib-compatible client API for making bulk log requests (e.g. for display
logs in applications without having to provide lots of information over D-Bus).</description>
