- update to 15.4.2 (15.4.1 was never released):
  * Fixed a Desktop Access resize bug which occurs when window was
    resized during MFA. #42705
  * Fixed listing available db users in Teleport Connect for
    databases from leaf clusters obtained through access requests.
    #42679
  * Fixed file upload/download for Teleport-created users in
    insecure-drop mode. #42660
  * Updated OpenSSL to 3.0.14. #42642
  * Fixed fetching resources with tons of metadata (such as labels
    or description) in Teleport Connect. #42627
  * Added support for Microsoft Entra ID directory synchronization
    (Teleport Enterprise only, preview). #42555
  * Added experimental support for storing audit events in
    cockroach. #42549
  * Teleport Connect binaries for Windows are now signed. #42472
  * Updated Go to 1.21.11. #42404
  * Added GCP Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL backend support. #42399
  * Added Prometheus metrics for the Postgres event backend. #42384
  * Fixed the event-handler Helm chart causing stuck rollouts when

  * Fixed web UI notification dropdown menu height from growing too
    long from many notifications. #42336
  * Disabled session recordings for non-interactive sessions when
    enhanced recording is disabled. There is no loss of auditing or
    impact on data fidelity because these recordings only contained
    session.start, session.end, and session.leave events which were
    already captured in the audit log. This will cause all teleport
    components to consume less resources and reduce storage costs.
    #42320
  * Fixed an issue where removing an app could make teleport app
    agents incorrectly report as unhealthy for a short time. #42270
  * Fixed a panic in the DynamoDB audit log backend when the cursor
    fell outside of the [From,To] interval. #42267
  * The teleport configure command now supports a --node-name flag
    for overriding the node's hostname. #42250
  * Added support plugin resource in tctl tool. #42224

      #41349

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 23 19:36:32 UTC 2024 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- update to 15.3.6 (no releases between .1 and .6):
  This release contains fixes for several high-severity security
  issues, as well as numerous other bug fixes and improvements.
  Security Fixes
  * [High] Unrestricted redirect in SSO Authentication
    Teleport didn’t sufficiently validate the client redirect URL.
    This could allow an attacker to trick Teleport users into
    performing an SSO authentication and redirect to an
    attacker-controlled URL allowing them to steal the credentials.
    #41834.
    Warning: Teleport will now disallow non-localhost callback URLs
    for SSO logins unless otherwise configured. Users of the tsh
    login --callback feature should modify their auth connector
    configuration as follows:
    The allowed_https_hostnames field is an array containing
    allowed hostnames, supporting glob matching and, if the string
    begins and ends with ^ and $ respectively, full regular
    expression syntax. Custom callback URLs are required to be
    HTTPS on the standard port (443).
  * [High] CockroachDB authorization bypass
    When connecting to CockroachDB using Database Access, Teleport
    did not properly consider the username case when running RBAC
    checks. As such, it was possible to establish a connection
    using an explicitly denied username when using a different
    case. #41823.
  * [High] Long-lived connection persistence issue with expired
    certificates
    Teleport did not terminate some long-running mTLS-authenticated
    connections past the expiry of client certificates for users
    with the disconnect_expired_cert option. This could allow such
    users to perform some API actions after their certificate has
    expired. #41827.
  * [High] PagerDuty integration privilege escalation
    When creating a role access request, Teleport would include
    PagerDuty annotations from the entire user’s role set rather
    than a specific role being requested. For users who run
    multiple PagerDuty access plugins with auto-approval, this
    could result in a request for a different role being
    inadvertently auto-approved than the one which corresponds to
    the user’s active on-call schedule. #41837.
  * [High] SAML IdP session privilege escalation
    When using Teleport as SAML IdP, authorization wasn’t properly
    enforced on the SAML IdP session creation. As such,
    authenticated users could use an internal API to escalate their
    own privileges by crafting a malicious program. #41846.
    We strongly recommend all customers upgrade to the latest
    releases of Teleport.
  Other fixes and improvements
  * Fixed access request annotations when annotations contain
    globs, regular
  * expressions, trait expansions, or claims_to_roles is used.
    #41936.
  * Added AWS Management Console as a guided flow using AWS OIDC
    integration in
  * the "Enroll New Resource" view in the web UI. #41864.
  * Fixed spurious Windows Desktop sessions screen resize during an
    MFA ceremony. #41856.
  * Fixed session upload completion with large number of
    simultaneous session
  * uploads. #41854.
  * Fixed MySQL databases version reporting on new connections.
    #41819.
  * Added read-only permissions for cluster maintenance config.
    #41790.
  * Stripped debug symbols from Windows builds, resulting in
    smaller tsh and
  * tctl binaries. #41787
  * Fixed passkey deletion so that a user may now delete their last
    passkey if
  * the have a password and another MFA configured. #41771.
  * Changed the default permissions for the Workload Identity Unix
    socket to 0777
  * rather than the default as applied by the umask. This will
    allow the socket to
  * be accessed by workloads running as users other than the user
    that owns the
  * tbot process. #41754
  * Added ability for teleport-event-handler to skip certain events
    type when
  * forwarding to an upstream server. #41747.
  * Added automatic GCP label importing. #41733.
  * Fixed missing variable and script options in Default Agentless
    Installer
  * script. #41723.
  * Removed invalid AWS Roles from Web UI picker. #41707.
  * Added remote address to audit log events emitted when a Bot or
    Instance join
  * completes, successfully or otherwise. #41700.
  * Simplified how Bots are shown on the Users list page. #41697.
  * Added improved-performance implementation of ProxyCommand for
    Machine ID and
  * SSH. This will become the default in v16. You can adopt this
    new mode early by
  * setting TBOT_SSH_CONFIG_PROXY_COMMAND_MODE=new. #41694.
  * Improved EC2 Auto Discovery by adding the SSM script output and
    more explicit
  * error messages. #41664.
  * Added webauthn diagnostics commands to tctl. #41643.
  * Upgraded application heartbeat service to support 1000+ dynamic
    applications. #41626
  * Fixed issue where Kubernetes watch requests are written out of
    order. #41624.
  * Fixed a race condition triggered by a reload during Teleport
    startup. #41592.
  * Updated discover wizard Install Script to support Ubuntu 24.04.
    #41589.
  * Fixed systemd unit to always restart Teleport on failure unless
    explicitly stopped. #41581.
  * Updated Teleport package installers to reload Teleport service
    config after
  * upgrades. #41547.
  * Fixed file truncation bug in Desktop Directory Sharing. #41540.
  * Fixed WebUI SSH connection leak when browser tab closed during
    SSH connection
  * establishment. #41518.
  * Fixed AccessList reconciler comparison causing audit events
    noise. #41517.
  * Added tooling to create SCIM integrations in tctl. #41514.
  * Fixed Windows Desktop error preventing rendering of the remote
    session. #41498.
  * Fixed issue in the PagerDuty, Opsgenie and ServiceNow access
    plugins that
  * causing duplicate calls on access requests containing duplicate
    service names.
  * Also increases the timeout so slow external API requests are
    less likely to
  * fail. #41488.
  * Added basic Unix workload attestation to the tbot SPIFFE
    workload API. You
  * can now restrict the issuance of certain SVIDs to processes
    running with a
  * certain UID, GID or PID. #41450.
  * Added "login failed" audit events for invalid passwords on
    password+webauthn
  * local authentication. #41432.
  * Fixed Terraform provider issue causing the Provision Token
    options to default
  * to false instead of empty. #41429.
  * Added support to automatically download CA for MongoDB Atlas
    databases. #41338.
  * Fixed broken "finish" web page for SSO Users on auto discover.
    #41335.
  * Allow setting Kubernetes Cluster name when using non-default
    addresses. #41331.
  * Added fallback on GetAccessList cache miss call. #41326.
  * Fixed DiscoveryService panic when auto-enrolling EKS clusters.
    #41320.
  * Added validation for application URL extracted from the web
    application launcher request route. #41304.
  * Allow defining custom database names and users when selecting
    wildcard during test connection when enrolling a database
    through the web UI. #41301.
  * Fixed broken link for alternative EC2 installation during EC2
    discover flow. #41292
  * Updated Go to v1.21.10. #41281.
  * Updated user management to explicitly deny password resets and
    local logins to
  * SSO users. #41270.
  * Fixed fetching suggested access lists with large IDs in
    Telepor...

Wed May  8 10:32:02 UTC 2024 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- update to 15.3.1:
  * Fixed screen_size behavior for Windows Desktops, which was
    being overridden by the new resize feature. #41241

    users with permissions to join sessions. #41221
  * Added indicators on the account settings page that tell which
    authentication methods are active. #41169
  * Fix a bug that was preventing tsh proxy kube certificate
    renewal from working when accessing a leaf kubernetes cluster
    via the root. #41158
  * Fixed AccessDeniedException for dynamodb:ConditionCheckItem
    operations when using AWS DynamoDB for cluster state storage.
    #41133

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May  2 17:45:44 UTC 2024 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- update to 15.3.0:
  * Improved Roles UI
    The Roles page of the web UI is now backed by a paginated API,
    ensuring fast load times even on clusters with large numbers of
    roles.
  * Resizing for Windows desktop sessions
    Windows desktop sessions now automatically resize as the size
    of the browser window changes.
  * Hardware key support for agentless nodes
    Teleport now supports connecting to agentless OpenSSH nodes
    even when Teleport is configured to require hardware key MFA
    checks.
  * TPM joining
    The new TPM join method enables secure joining for agents and
    Machine ID bots that run on-premise. Based on the secure
    properties of the host's hardware trusted platform module, this
    join method removes the need to create and distribute secret
    tokens, significantly reducing the risk of exfiltration.
  * Other improvements and fixes
    - Fixed user SSO bypass by performing a local passwordless
      login. #41067
    - Enforce allow_passwordless server-side. #41057
    - Fixed a memory leak caused by incorrectly passing the offset
      when paginating all Access Lists' members when there are more
      than the default pagesize (200) Access Lists. #41045
    - Added resize capability to windows desktop sessions. #41025
    - Fixed a regression causing roles filtering to not work.
      #40999
    - Allow AWS integration to be used for global services without
      specifying a valid region. #40991
    - Made account id visible when selecting IAM Role for accessing
      the AWS Console. #40987

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Apr 27 09:30:21 UTC 2024 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- update to 15.2.5:
  * Extend proxy templates to allow the target host to be resolved
    via a predicate expression or fuzzy matching. #40966
  * Fix an issue where access requests would linger in UI and tctl
    after expiry. #40964
  * The teleport-cluster Helm chart can configure AccessMonitoring
    when running in aws mode. #40957
  * Make podSecurityContext configurable in the teleport-cluster
    Helm chart. #40951
  * Allow to mount extra volumes in the updater pod deployed by the
    teleport-kube-agentchart. #40946
  * Improve error message when performing an SSO login with a
    hardware key. #40923
  * Fix a bug in the teleport-cluster Helm chart that happened when
    sessionRecording was off. #40919

  * Add the ability to control ssh_config generation in Machine
    ID's Identity Outputs. This allows the generation of the
    ssh_config to be disabled if unnecessary, improving performance
    and removing the dependency on the Proxy being online. #40861
  * Prevent deleting AWS OIDC integration used by External Audit
    Storage. #40851
  * Introduce the tpm join method, which allows for secure joining
    in on-prem environments without the need for a shared secret.
    #40823
  * Reduce parallelism when polling AWS resources to prevent API
    throttling when exporting them to Teleport Access Graph. #40811
  * Fix spurious deletion of Access List Membership metadata during
    SCIM push or sync. #40544
  * Properly enforce session moderation requirements when starting
    Kubernetes ephemeral containers. #40906

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 25 05:34:37 UTC 2024 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- update to 15.2.4 (skipping non-existing release 15.2.3):
  * Fixed a deprecation warning being shown when tbot is used with
    OpenSSH. #40837

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Apr 13 09:36:55 UTC 2024 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- update to 15.2.2:
  * Updated the cluster selector in the UI to now only be visible
    when more than one cluster is available. #40478
  * Fixed accidental passkey "downgrades" to MFA. #40409

  * Changed Teleport Connect to hide cluster name in the connection
    list if there is only a single cluster available. #40356
  * Fixed invalid session TTL error when creating access request
    with tsh. #40335
  * Added missing discovery AWS matchers fields "Integration" and
    "KubeAppDiscovery" to the file configuration. #40320
  * Added automatic role access requests. #40285
  * Redesigned the login UI. #40272
  * Added friendly role names for Okta sourced roles. These will be
    displayed in access list and access request pages in the UI.
    #40260
  * Added Teleport Machine ID Workload Identity support for legacy
    systems which are not able to parse DNS SANs, and which are not
    SPIFFE aware. #40180

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Apr  6 20:08:36 UTC 2024 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- update to 15.2.1:
 * Teleport Connect now shows all recent connections instead of
   capping them at 10. #40250
 * Limit max read size for the tsh device trust DMI cache file on
   Linux. #40234
 * Fix an issue that prevents the teleport service from restarting.
   #40229
 * Add new resource filtering predicates to allow exact matches on
   a single item of a delimited list stored in a label value. For
   example, if given the following label containing a string
   separated list of values foo=bar,baz,bang, it is now possible to
   match on any resources with a label foo that contains the
   element bar via contains(split(labels[foo], ","), bar). #40183
 * Updated Go to 1.21.9. #40176
 * Adds disable_exec_plugin option to the Machine ID Kubernetes
   Output to remove the dependency on tbot existing in the target
   environment. #40162
 * Adds the database-tunnel service to tbot which allows an
   authenticated database tunnel to be opened by tbot. This is an
   improvement over the original technique of using tbot proxy db.
   #40151
 * Allow diagnostic endpoints to be accessed behind a PROXY
   protocol enabled loadbalancer/proxy. #40138
 * Include system annotations in audit event entries for access
   requests. #40123
 * Fixed GitHub Auth Connector update event to show in Audit Log
   with name and description. #40116
 * Re-enabled the show_desktop_wallpaper flag. #40088
 * Reduce default Jamf inventory page size, allow custom values to
   be provided. #3817

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Mar 30 17:16:29 UTC 2024 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- update to 15.2.0:
  * Improved Access Requests UI
    The access requests page of the web UI will be backed by a
    paginated API, ensuring fast load times even on clusters with
    many access requests.
    Additionally, the UI allows you to search for access requests,
    sort them based on various attributes, and includes several new
    filtering options.
  * Zero-downtime web asset rollout
    Teleport 15.2 changes the way that web assets are served and
    cached, which will allow multiple compatible versions of the
    Teleport Proxy to run behind the same load balancer.
  * Workload Identity MVP
    With Teleport 15.2, Machine ID can bootstrap and issue identity
    to services across multiple computing environments and
    organizational boundaries. Workload Identity issues
    SPIFFE-compatible x509 certificates that can be used for mTLS
    between services.
  * Support for Kubernetes 1.29+
    The Kubernetes project is deprecating the SPDY protocol for
    streaming commands (kubectl exec, kubectl port-forward, etc)
    and replacing it with a new websocket-based subprotocol.
    Teleport 15.2.0 will support the new protocol to ensure
    compatibility with newer Kubernetes clusters.
  * Automatic database access requests
    Both tsh db connect and tsh proxy db will offer the option to
    submit an access request if the user attempts to connect to a
    database that they don't already have access to.
  * GCP console access via Workforce Identity Federation
    Teleport administrators will be able to setup access to GCP web
    console through Workforce Identity Federation using Teleport as
    a SAML identity provider.
  * IaC support for OpenSSH nodes
    Users will be able to register OpenSSH nodes in the cluster
    using Terraform and Kubernetes Operator.
  * Access requests start time
    Users submitting access requests via web UI will be able to
    request specific access start time up to a week in advance.
  * Terraform and Operator support for agentless SSH nodes
    The Teleport Terraform provider and Kubernetes operator now
    support declaring agentless OpenSSH and OpenSSH EC2 ICE
    servers. You can follow this guide to register OpenSSH agents
    with infrastructure as code.
    Setting up EC2 ICE automatic discovery with IaC will come in a
    future update.
  * Operator and CRDs can be deployed separately
    The teleport-operator and teleport-cluster charts now support
    deploying only the CRD, the CRD and the operator, or only the
    operator.
    From the teleport-cluster Helm chart:
      operator:
        enabled: true|false
        installCRDs: always|never|dynamic
    From the teleport-operator Helm chart:
      enabled: true|false
      installCRDs: always|never|dynamic
    In dynamic mode (by default), the chart will install CRDs if
    the operator is enabled, but will not remove the CRDs if you
    temporarily disable the operator.
  * Operator now propagates labels
    Kubernetes CR labels are now copied to the Teleport resource
    when applicable.
    This allows you to configure RBAC for operator-created
    resources, and to filter Teleport resources more easily.
  * Terraform provider no longer forces resource re-creation on
    version change
    Teleport v15 introduced two Terraform provider changes:
    - setting the resource version is now mandatory
    - a resource version change triggers the resource re-creation
      to ensure defaults were correctly set
    The second change was too disruptive, especially for roles, as
    they cannot be deleted if a user or an access list references
    them. Teleport 15.2 lifts this restriction and allows version
    change without forcing the resource deletion.
    Another change to ensure resource defaults are correctly set
    during version upgrades will happen in v16.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Mar 17 09:41:08 UTC 2024 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- update to 15.1.0:
  * New Features
    - Standalone tbot Docker image
      We now ship a new container image that contains tbot but
      omits other Teleport binaries, providing a light-weight
      option for Machine ID users.
    - Custom mouse pointers for remote desktop sessions
      Teleport remote desktop sessions now automatically change the
      mouse cursor depending on context (when hovering over a link,
      resizing a window, or editing text, for example).
    - Synchronization of Okta groups and apps
      Okta integration now support automatic synchronization of
      Okta groups and app assignments to Teleport as access lists
      giving users ability to request access to Okta apps without
      extra configuration.
    - EKS auto-discovery in Access Management UI

      MFA is required to create, update, or delete trusted
      clusters. #38690
    - Fixed error in tctl get users --with-secrets when using SSO.
      #38663

      #38657
    - Temporary files are no longer created during Discover UI EKS
      cluster enrollment. #38649
    - When teleport is configured to require MFA for admin actions,
      MFA is required to get or list tokens with tctl. Ex: tctl
      tokens ls or tctl get tokens/foo. #38645
    - Implemented dynamic mouse pointer updates to reflect
      context-specific actions, e.g. window resizing. #38614
    - MFA approval is no longer required in the beginning of EKS
      Discover flow. #38580

      appearing in the Web UI until the Proxy is restarted. #38310
    - Desktops can now be configured to use the same screen
      resolution for all sessions. #38307
    - The maximum duration for an access request is now 14 days,
      the okta-requester role has been added which takes advantage
      of this. #38224
    - Added TLS routing native WebSocket connection upgrade
      support. #38108

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov 16 14:24:38 UTC 2023 - kastl@b1-systems.de

- Update to version 14.1.3:
  * Security Fixes
    - [Medium] Arbitrary code execution with LD_PRELOAD and SFTP
      Teleport implements SFTP using a subcommand. Prior to this
      release it was possible to inject environment variables into
      the execution of this subcommand, via shell init scripts or
      via the SSH environment request.
      This is addressed by preventing LD_PRELOAD and other
      dangerous environment variables from being forwarded during
      re-exec.
  * [Medium] Outbound SSH from Proxy can lead to IP spoofing
      If the Teleport auth or proxy services are configured to
      accept PROXY protocol headers, a malicious actor can use this
      to spoof their IP address.
      This is addressed by requiring that the first bytes of any
      SSH connection are the SSH protocol prefix, denying a
      malicious actor the opportunity to send their own proxy
      headers.
  * Other Fixes & Improvements
    - Fixed issue where tbot would select the wrong address for
      Kubernetes Access when in ports separate mode #34283
    - Added post-review state of Access Request in audit log
      description #34213

      version provided by Automatic Upgrades #34157
    - Updated Server Auto-Discovery installer script to use bash
      instead of sh #34144
    - When a promotable Access Request targets a resource that
      belongs to an Access List, owners of that list will now
      automatically be added as reviewers. #34131
    - Added Database Automatic User Provisioning support for
      Redshift #34126
    - Added teleport_auth_type config parameter to the AWS
      Terraform examples #34124

Tue Oct 24 09:46:50 UTC 2023 - kastl@b1-systems.de

- Update to version 14.0.0:
  very large changelog, please check it here:
  https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/releases/tag/v14.0.0

  Breaking changes and deprecations
  * SSH node open dial no longer supported
    Teleport 14 no longer allows connecting to OpenSSH servers not
    registered with the cluster. Follow the updated agentless
    OpenSSH integration guide to register your OpenSSH nodes in the
    cluster’s inventory.
    You can set TELEPORT_UNSTABLE_UNLISTED_AGENT_DIALING=yes
    environment variable on Teleport proxy to temporarily re-enable
    the open dial functionality. The environment variable will be
    removed in Teleport 15.
  * Proxy protocol default change
    Starting from version 14, Teleport will require users to
    explicitly enable or disable PROXY protocol in their
    proxy_service/auth_service configuration using proxy_protocol:
    on|off option.
    Users who run their proxies behind L4 load balancers with PROXY
    protocol enabled, should set proxy_protocol: on. Users who
    don’t run Teleport behind PROXY protocol enabled load
    balancers, should disable proxy_protocol: off explicitly for
    security reasons.
    By default, Teleport will accept the PROXY line but will
    prevent connections with IP pinning enabled. IP pinning users
    will need to explicitly enable/disable proxy protocol like
    explained above.
    See more details in our documentation.
  * Legacy deb/rpm package repositories are deprecated
    Teleport 14 will be the last release published to the legacy
    package repositories at deb.releases.teleport.dev and
    rpm.releases.teleport.dev. Starting with Teleport 15, packages
    will only be published to the new repositories at
    apt.releases.teleport.dev and yum.releases.teleport.dev.
    All users are recommended to switch to
    apt.releases.teleport.dev and yum.releases.teleport.dev
    repositories as described in installation instructions.
  * Cf-Access-Token header no longer included with app access requests
    Starting from Teleport 14, the Cf-Access-Token header
    containing the signed JWT token will no longer be included by
    default with all app access requests. All requests will still
    include Teleport-JWT-Assertion containing the JWT token.
    See documentation for details on how to inject the JWT token
    into any header using header rewriting.
  * tsh db CLI commands changes
    In Teleport 14 tsh db sub-commands will attempt to select a
    default value for --db-user or --db-name flags if they are not
    provided by the user by examining their allowed db_users and
    db_names.
    The flags --cert-file and --key-file for tsh proxy db command
    were also removed, in favor of the --tunnel flag that opens an
    authenticated local database proxy.
  * MongoDB versions prior to 3.6 are no longer supported
    Teleport 14 includes an update to the MongoDB driver.
    Due to the MongoDB team dropping support for servers prior to
    version 3.6 (which reached EOL on April 30, 2021), Teleport
    also will no longer be able to support these old server
    versions.
  * Symlinks for ~/.tsh/environment no longer supported
    In order to strengthen the security in Teleport 14, file
    loading from home directories where the path includes a symlink
    is no longer allowed. The most common use case for this is
    loading environment variables from the ~/.tsh/environment file.
    This will still work normally as long as the path includes no
    symlinks.
  * Deprecated audit event
    Teleport 14 deprecates the trusted_cluster_token.create audit
    event, replacing it with a new join_token.create event. The new
    event is emitted when any join token is created, whether it be
    for trusted clusters or other Teleport services.
    Teleport 14 will emit both events when a trusted cluster join
    token is created. Starting in Teleport 15, the
    trusted_cluster_token.create event will no longer be emitted.

Wed Feb 08 07:53:13 UTC 2023 - kastl@b1-systems.de

- Update to version 12.0.0:
  Full changelog is available at
  https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/releases/tag/v12.0.0

  Teleport 12 brings the following marquee features and improvements:
    - Device Trust (Preview, Enterprise only)
    - Passwordless Windows access for local users (Preview, Enterprise only)
    - Per-pod RBAC for Kubernetes Access (Preview)
    - Azure and GCP CLI support for Application Access (Preview)
    - Support for more databases in Database Access:
      - AWS DynamoDB
      - AWS Redshift Serverless
      - AWS RDS Proxy for PostgreSQL/MySQL
      - Azure SQLServer Auto Discovery
      - Azure Flexible Servers
    - Refactored Helm charts (Preview)
    - Dropped support for SHA1 in Server Access
    - Signed/notarized macOS binaries

  * Azure and GCP CLI support for Application Access (Preview)
    In Teleport 12 administrators can interact with Azure and GCP APIs through
    Application Access using `tsh az` and `tsh gcloud` CLI commands, or using
    standard `az` and `gcloud` tools through the local application proxy.
  * Support for more databases in Database Access
    Database Access in Teleport 12 brings a number of new integrations to AWS-hosted
    databases such as DynamoDB (now with audit log support), Redshift Serverless and
    RDS Proxy for PostgreSQL/MySQL.
    On Azure, Database Access adds SQLServer auto-discovery and support for Azure
    Flexible Server for PostgreSQL/MySQL.
  * Refactored Helm charts (Preview)
    The “teleport-cluster” Helm chart underwent significant refactoring in Teleport
    12 to provide better scalability and UX. Proxy and Auth are now separate
    deployments and the new “scratch” chart mode makes it easier to provide a custom
    Teleport config.
    “Custom” mode users should follow the migration guide:
    https://goteleport.com/docs/ver/12.x/deploy-a-cluster/helm-deployments/migration-v12/
  * Dropped support for SHA1 in Server Access
    Newer OpenSSH clients connecting to Teleport 12 clusters no longer need the
    “PubAcceptedKeyTypes” workaround to include the deprecated “sha” algorithm.
  * Signed/notarized macOS binaries
    Users who download Teleport 12 Darwin binaries would no longer get an untrusted
    software warning from macOS.
  * tctl edit
    tctl now supports an edit subcommand, allowing you to edit resources directly in
    your preferred text editor.
  * Breaking Changes
    Please familiarize yourself with the following potentially disruptive changes in
    Teleport 12 before upgrading.
    - Helm charts
      The teleport-cluster Helm chart underwent significant changes in Teleport 12. To
      upgrade from an older version of the Helm chart deployed in “custom” mode, use
      the following migration guide:
      https://goteleport.com/docs/ver/12.x/deploy-a-cluster/helm-deployments/migration-v12/
      Additionally, PSPs are removed from the chart when installing on Kubernetes 1.23
      and higher to account for the deprecation/removal of PSPs by Kubernetes.
    - tctl auth export
      The tctl auth export command only exports the private key when passing the
      --keys flag. Previously it would output the certificate and private key
      together.
    - Desktop Access
      Windows Desktop sessions disable the wallpaper by default, improving
      performance. To restore the previous behavior, add `show_desktop_wallpaper: true`
      to your windows_desktop_service config.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Feb 12 20:48:45 UTC 2022 - Johannes Kastl <kastl@b1-systems.de>

- split up into three packages: teleport aka server/daemon, teleport-tctl and teleport-tsh

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Feb 12 08:10:06 UTC 2022 - Johannes Kastl <kastl@b1-systems.de>

- new package teleport: Teleport is an identity-aware, multi-protocol access proxy which understands SSH, HTTPS, RDP, Kubernetes API, MySQL, MongoDB and PostgreSQL wire protocols.
