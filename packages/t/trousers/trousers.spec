%description
The trousers package provides a TSS implementation through the help of
a user-space daemon, the tcsd, and a library  Trousers aims to be
compliant to the 1.1b and 1.2 TSS specifications as available from the
Trusted Computing website http://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org/.

The package needs the /dev/tpm device file to be present on your
system. It is a character device file major 10 minor 224, 0600 tss:tss.

# this scriplet and the counterpart in %posttrans work around a packaging bug
# that was present in all trousers packages since around 2008 until 2018.
# /var/lib/tpm/system.data.* was wrongly packaged as runtime state data
# instead of package resource data in /usr/share. After removal of these files
# from packaging, during updating they will be deleted. Since users could have
# created their own versions of the files already (by taking ownership of a
# TPM) we want to keep those files in place.
#
# to achieve this we use the ownership of /var/lib/tpm as an indicator.
# Versions that still wrongly package those files also had the ownership of
# the directory wrong. Therefore if the directory is not owned by the tss user
# we apply a backup and restore logic.
