  <title>Turbo text editor</title>
  <description>Turbo is an experimental text editor for the terminal,
based on the Scintilla code editing component by Neil
Hodgson and the Turbo Vision application framework.

It was created to demonstrate new features in Turbo
Vision. In particular, it has served as testing ground
for Turbo Vision's Unicode capabilities.

As a text editor, Turbo aims at being intuitive and easy
to use. Usability and productivity are its two other
major objectives, although it has not got that far yet.
And only for being a Turbo Vision application, it
offers a vintage look and feel.</description>
