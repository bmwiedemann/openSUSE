Thu Feb 16 14:41:06 UTC 2023 - Alberto Planas Dominguez <aplanas@suse.com>

- Drop 0001-tss2_rc-ensure-layer-number-is-in-bounds.patch as was
  already merged upstream
- Update to 4.0.1
  + Fixed:
    * A buffer overflow in tss2-rc as CVE-2023-22745.
- Update to 4.0.0
  + Fixed:
    * tcti-ldr: Use heap instead of stack when tcti initialize
    * Fix usage of NULL pointer if Esys_TR_SetAuth is calles with
      ESYS_TR_NONE.
    * Conditionally check user/group manipulation commands.
    * Store VERSION into the release tarball.
    * When using DESTDIR for make einstall, do not invoke
      systemd-sysusers and systemd-tmpfiles.
    * esys_iutil: fix possible NPD.
    * Tss2_Sys_Flushcontext: flushHandle was encoded as a handleArea
      handle and not as parameter one, this affected the contents of
      cpHash.
    * esys: fix allow usage of HMAC sessions for
      Esys_TR_FromTPMPublic.
    * fapi: fix usage of policy_nv with a TPM nv index.
    * linking tcti for libtpms against tss2-tctildr. It should be
      linked against tss2-mu.
    * build: Remove erroneous trailing comma in linker option. Bug
      #2391.
    * fapi: fix encoding of complex tpm2bs in authorize nv,
      duplication select and policy template policies. Now the complex
      and TPMT or TPMS representations can be used. Bug #2383
    * The error message for unsupported FAPI curves was in hex without
      a leading 0x, make it integer output to clarify.
    * Documentation that had various scalar out pointers as "callee
      allocated".
    * test: build with opaque FILE structure like in musl libc.
    * Transient endorsement keys were not recreated according to the
      EK credential profile.
    * Evict control for a persistent EK failed during provisioning if
      an auth value for the storage hierarchy was set.
    * The authorization of the storage hierarchy is now added. Fixes
      FAPI: Provisioning error if an auth value is needed for the
      storage hierarchy #2438.
    * Usage of a second profile in a path was not possible because the
      default profile was always used.
    * The setting of an empty auth value for Fapi_Provision was fixed.
    * JSON encoding of a structure TPMS_POLICYAUTHORIZATION used the
      field keyPEMhashAlg instead of hashAlg as defined in "TCG TSS
      2.0 JSON Data Types and Policy Language Specification". Rename
      to hashAlg but preserve support for reading keyPEMhashAlg for
      backwards compatibility.
    * fapi: PolicySecret did not work with keys as secret object.
    * Esys_PCR_SetAuthValue: remembers the auth like other SetAutg
      ESAPI functions.
    * tests: esys-pcr-auth-value.int moved to destructive tests.
    * FAPI: Fix double free if keystore is corrupted.
    * Marshaling of TPMU_CAPABILITIES data, only field
      intelPttProperty was broken before.a
    * Spec deviation in Fapi_GetDescription caused description to be
      NULL when it should be empty string. This is API breaking but
      considered a bug since it deviated from the FAPI spec.
    * FAPI: undefined reference to curl_url_strerror when using curl
      less than 7.80.0.
    * FAPI: Fixed support for EK templates in NV inidices per the
      spec, see #2518 for details.
    * FAPI: fix NPD in ifapi_curl logging.
    * FAPI: Improve documentation fapi-profile
    * FAPI: Fix CURL HTTP handling.
    * FAPI: Return FAPI_RC_IO_ERROR if a policy does not exist in
      keystore.
  + Added:
    * TPM version 1.59 support.
    * ci: ubuntu-22.04 added.
    * mbedTLS 3.0 is supported by ESAPI.
    * Add CreationHash to JSON output for usage between applications
      not using the FAPI keystore, like command line tools.
    * Reduced code size for SAPI.
    * Support for Runtime Switchable ESAPI Crypto Backend via
      Esys_SetCryptoCallbacks.
    * Testing for TCG EK Credential Profile TPM 2.0, Version 2.4
      Rev. 3, 2021 for the low and high address range of EK templates.
    * tss2-rc: Tss2_RC_DecodeInfo function for parsing TSS2_RC into
      the various bit fields.
    * FAPI support for P_ECC384 profile.
    * tss2-rc: Tss2_RC_DecodeInfoError: Function to get a human
      readable error from a TSS2_RC_INFO returned by
      Tss2_RC_DecodeInfo
    * tcti: Generic SPI driver, implementors only need to connect to
      acquire/release, transmit/receive, and sleep/timeout functions.
    * FAPI: Add event logging for Firmware and IMA Events. See #2170
      for details.
    * FAPI: Fix Fapi_ChangeAuth updates on hierarchy objects not being
      reflected across profiles.
    * FAPI: Allow keyedhash keys in PolicySigned.
    * ESAPI: Support sha512 for mbedtls crypto backend.
    * TPM2B_MAX_CAP_BUFFER and mu routines
    * vendor field to TPMU_CAPABILTIIES
    * FAPI: support for PolicyTemplate
  + Changed
    * libmu soname from 0:0:0 to 0:1:0.
    * tss2-sys soname from 1:0:0 to 1:1:0
    * tss2-esys: from 0:0:0 to 0:1:0

    ship the source.
