- Update to release 1.12

Release Notes
  The cluster health related fields in the elasticsearch input have been split
  out from the elasticsearch_indices mesasurement into the new
  elasticsearch_cluster_health_indices measurement as they were originally
  combined by error.

Release Notes
  The uptime_format field in the system input has been deprecated, use the
  uptime field instead.
  The cloudwatch input has been updated to use a more efficient API, it now
  requires GetMetricData permissions instead of GetMetricStatistics. The
  units tag is not available from this API and is no longer collected.

Release Notes
  The http_listener input plugin has been renamed to influxdb_listener and
  use of the original name is deprecated. The new name better describes the
  intended use of the plugin as a InfluxDB relay. For general purpose
  transfer of metrics in any format via HTTP, it is recommended to use
  http_listener_v2 instead.

  Input plugins are no longer limited from adding metrics when the output is
  writing, and new metrics will move into the metric buffer as needed. This
  will provide more robust degradation and recovery when writing to a slow
  output at high throughput.

  To avoid over consumption when reading from queue consumers: kafka_consumer,
  amqp_consumer, mqtt_consumer, nats_consumer, and nsq_consumer use
  the new option max_undelivered_messages to limit the number of outstanding
  unwritten metrics.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr 18 16:17:05 UTC 2018 - mschnitzer@suse.com

- Release 1.6.0

  * Release Notes

    - The mysql input plugin has been updated fix a number of type convertion issues. This may cause a field type error when inserting
      into InfluxDB due the change of types.

    - To address this we have introduced a new metric_version option to control enabling the new format. For in depth recommendations on
      upgrading please reference the mysql plugin documentation.

    - It is encouraged to migrate to the new model when possible as the old version is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.

    - The postgresql plugins now defaults to using a persistent connection to the database. In environments where TCP connections are
      terminated the max_lifetime setting should be set less than the collection interval to prevent errors.

    - The sqlserver input plugin has a new query and data model that can be enabled by setting query_version = 2. It is encouraged to
      migrate to the new model when possible as the old version is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.

    - An option has been added to the openldap input plugin that reverses metric name to improve grouping. This change is enabled
      when reverse_metric_names = true is set. It is encouraged to enable this option when possible as the old ordering is deprecated.

    - The new http input configured with data_format = "json" can perform the same task as the, now deprecated, httpjson input.
