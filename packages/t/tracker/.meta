  <title>Powerful object database, tag/metadata database, search tool and indexer</title>
  <description>Tracker is a powerful desktop-neutral first class object
database, tag/metadata database, search tool and indexer.

It consists of a common object database that allows entities to
have an almost infinite number of properties, metadata (both
embedded/harvested as well as user definable), a comprehensive
database of keywords/tags and links to other entities.

It provides additional features for file-based objects
including context linking and audit trails for a file object.

It has the ability to index, store, harvest metadata, retrieve
and search all types of files and other first class objects.</description>
