  <title>Twitter Color Emoji SVGinOT Font</title>
  <description>A color and B&amp;W emoji SVGinOT font built from the Twitter Emoji for Everyone artwork with support for ZWJ, skin tone diversity and country flags.

The font works in all operating systems, but will currently only show color emoji in Firefox, Thunderbird and other Mozilla Gecko-based applications. This is not a limitation of the font, but of the operating systems and applications. Regular B&amp;W outline emoji are included for backwards/fallback compatibility.</description>
