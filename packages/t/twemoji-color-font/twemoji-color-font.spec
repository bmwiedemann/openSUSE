%description
A color and monochrome emoji SVG-in-OpenType font built from the
Twitter Emoji for Everyone artwork with support for ZWJ,
skin tone diversity and country flags.

The font works in all operating systems, but will currently only
show color emoji in Firefox, Thunderbird and other Mozilla Gecko-based
applications. This is not a limitation of the font but of the
operating systems and applications. Regular monochrome outline
emoji are included for backwards/fallback compatibility.
