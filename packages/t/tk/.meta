  <title>Graphical User Interface Toolkit for Tcl</title>
  <description>Tk is a graphical user interface toolkit that takes developing desktop
applications to a higher level than conventional approaches. Tk is the
standard GUI not only for Tcl, but for many other dynamic languages,
and can produce rich, native applications that run unchanged across
Windows, Mac OS X, Linux and more.</description>
