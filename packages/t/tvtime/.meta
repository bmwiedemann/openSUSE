  <title>High Quality Television Application</title>
  <description>tvtime is a high quality television application for use with video
capture cards.	tvtime processes the input from a capture card and
displays it on a computer monitor or projector.  Unlike other
television applications, tvtime focuses on high visual quality.

tvtime supports: * Deinterlaced output at a full interlaced rate of
   59.94 frames per second for NTSC source or 50 frames per second
   for PAL sources. This gives smoothness of motion and high visual
   quality.

* Multiple deinterlacing algorithms for finding the optimal mode for
   your video content and available processor speed.

* 16:9 aspect ratio mode for the highest available resolution when
   processing input from an external DVD player or digital satellite
   receiver.

* A super-slick on-screen display for the complete television
   experience, with a feature-rich menu system.

* 2-3 Pulldown detection for optimal quality viewing of film content
   from NTSC sources.
