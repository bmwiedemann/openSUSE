- Upgrade to version 7.4.0
  * Features:
    + Ability to be notified when a data provider fails, through
      a TestNG listener.
      TestNG already has a listener that will let you plug in your
      callbacks for the following with respect to a data provider
      (implement org.testng.IDataProviderListener interface)
      You can now use this listener to be notified when a data
      provider fails as well.
    + Add the ability to override explicitly included test methods
      if they belong to any excluded groups via the configuration
      property : overrideIncludedMethods
    + Reduced memory foot print when trying to run tests with
      larger projects.
      This is now a toggle feature which can be enabled via the
      JVM argument: -Dtestng.memory.friendly=true
