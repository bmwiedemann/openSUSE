- Update to version 0.17.0:
  * Queuing transfers:
    - the logic of selecting files has been extended!
    - From now on selecting file will put the files into a transfer
      queue, which is shown on the bottom panel.
    - When a file is selected the file is added to the queue with a
      destination path, which is the current other explorer path at
      the moment of selection.
    - It is possible to navigate to the transfer queue by using P
      and pressing ENTER or DELETE on a file will remove it from
      the transfer queue.
    - Other commands will work as well on the transfer queue, like
      COPY, MOVE, DELETE, RENAME.
  * issue 308: added --wno-keyring flag to disable keyring
  * issue 316: Local directory path is not switching to what's
    specified in the bookmark. Now the local directory path is

    - Working directory
