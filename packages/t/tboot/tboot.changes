Mon Jun 17 13:09:34 UTC 2024 - Matthias Gerstner <matthias.gerstner@suse.com>

- add tboot.rpmlintrc: suppress warning about missing %check section. There's
  no testsuite for tboot.
- mark grub.d snippets as %config (noreplace) to satisfy rpmlint warning
  (the grub2 package itself marks its snippets this way, so it seems to be
  common standard to do so).
- update to v1.11.4:
  * v1.11.4
    Increase the TBOOT log size from 32 KB to 64 KB. For some Intel server
    platforms, it was noticed that TBOOT_SERIAL_LOG memory section was too
    small to hold all of the print logs, produced by TBOOT. Due to this
    reason TBOOT log section memory size had to be increase to 64KB.
  * v1.11.3
    Fix the hanging TBOOT issue, which appeared during the RLPs wakeup process
    on the Intel's multisocket platform. This problem appeared during the AP
    stacks allocations for these RLPs. TBOOT allocated memory for them depending
    on the woken-up CPUs X2 APIC values. When some of them exceeded the NR_CPUS (1024),
    then the RLP wakeup process execution halted. For the current moment,
    the maximal X2 APID value was increased from 1024 to 8192. This kind of
    solution fixed the given problem.
  * v1.11.2
    Fix the RAM memory allocation algorithm for the initrd.
