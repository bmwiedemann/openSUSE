- Use update-alternatives for the tx binary so users can
  install in the same system transifex-client and python3-afdko

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun 12 07:04:35 UTC 2020 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Update to 0.13.9:
  * Change symlink loop prevention approach

- Update to 0.13.8:
  * Tx-client is now able to follow any symbolic links while
    pushing content to Transifex.

- Update to 0.13.7:
  * Loosen up dependency versions and support Python 3.8
  * Add missing description content type in setup.py

- Update to 0.13.6:
  * Extend Python support

- Update to 0.13.5:
  * Pin dependencies to avoid incompatibilities between packages

- Update to 0.13.4:
  * Support Python 3.7
  * Make the wizard handle unknown file formats gracefully

- Update to 0.13.3:
  * Use the TX_TOKEN environment variable to set your Transifex API
    token. This essentially replaces the --token argument in the tx
    init command, and does not write any credentials in the
    .transifexrc file.
  * Add the --no-interactive argument in the tx pull command, for
    the case where no user input is required. This is needed in
    some cases where a CI does not want to proceed with user input
    and needs to fail silently.

- Update to 0.13.2:
  * Push and pull files more quickly by using the new --parallel
    option with tx push and tx pull to make parallel requests. This
    is a beta feature - be careful when using it with many files as
    it may cause you to hit your API rate limits.

  * --expression is now a named argument for tx config mapping so
    it’s consistent with the tx config mapping-bulk command with
    regard to how you pass a file path expression.

  * The algorithm for locating translation files has been optimized
    to improve performance in cases where you have many files in
    your working directory.

- Update to 0.13.1:
  * Fix some python 3 compatibility issues
  * Fix CI for python 3
  * Add Python 3.6 in the supported versions

- Update to 0.13.0:
  * Rename set command to config while maintaining backwards
    compatibility.
  * --auto-local, --auto-remote options have become mapping and
    mapping-remote subcommands. Backwards compatibility has been
    maintained and the options (and subcommands) are supported both
    when using tx set and tx config commands.
  * Introduce mapping-bulk subcommand to tx config command.
    mapping-bulk is similar to mapping but configures a whole
    directory of files and not a single file.
  * Support branch specific push / pull using the --branch option.
  * Add interactive wizard for tx config command. Interactive wizard
    is triggered by default after tx init if --skipsetup option is
    not passed and by the tx config if called without any options
    or subcommands.

- Update to 0.12.5:
  * Support for Basic Authentication when using the client behind
    a proxy
  * Support for sourceastranslation and onlyreviewed modes when
    pulling files
  * Return non-zero exit codes on errors
  * tx --version now includes information about the Python version
    and architecture you’re running
  * Some updates and minor fixes in logging/error messages

- initial package 0.8
  * Enable support for compressed responses from Transifex.
  * Specify a custom User-Agent header for the HTTP requests performed by the client.
  * Specify a timeout of 5min for each request, so that the client does not block indefinitely.
  * Offer to migrate the .transifexrc file to use secure (SSL) connections by default, when connecting to Transifex servers, and the new domain, Transifex.com. The migration process does not update the .tx/config file, since that file might be part of a repository.
  * Send warning messages to standard output. This means that only actual errors are sent to standard error and, as a result, redirecting the output works correctly.
  * Don’t use colors, when the output is not a TTY. As a result, the output of the client when piped to other programs will not be garbled.
