Fri Feb 14 19:33:55 UTC 2025 - Andreas Stieger <andreas.stieger@gmx.de>

- Prepare package for openSUSE Tumbleweed inclusion
- properly package shared library, add tqsl-tqsllib.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Dec  6 17:42:20 UTC 2024 - Wojciech Kazubski <wk@ire.pw.edu.pl>

- Update to version 2.7.5
  * TQSL now allows renewal of certificates which have not expired.
  * When updating QTH details from an ADIF log, certain fields such
    as US_STATE were not upper-cased as expected by Logbook of the
    World. TQSL now properly uppercases those fields.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov  8 21:53:47 UTC 2024 - Wojciech Kazubski <wk@ire.pw.edu.pl>

- Update to version 2.7.4
  * Further correction of handling of US portable callsigns and FCC
    Universal Licensing Service (ULS) data.
  * Correct handling of language mapping. Changes to the underlying
    wxWidgets platform caused some translations to fail.
  * When editing or creating Station Locations, saving of invalid
    gridsquares is now rejected. TQSL would allow a user to
    repeatedly click “next” to bypass the check.
  * TQSL now has a database of valid gridsquares indexed by DXCC
    entity and primary subdivision (state, province, etc.) allowing
    detection of invalid gridsquares in station locations.
  * When upload of a Callsign Certificate request fails, TQSL now
    allows the user to save that for a later upload.
  * Handle network outages more graciously. Don’t repeatedly try to
    connect to Logbook when it’s down, as this could cause startup
    to take many minutes for some circumstances. TQSL now detects
    the errors and stops trying.
  * Allow renewal of Callsign Certificates that expired within the
    last 90 days.
  * Warn users with US base callsigns and portable modifiers that
    reciprocity agreements such as CEPT require US callsign holders
    to be US citizens.
  * Suppress “wxGTK-WARNING” messages on Linux systems.
  * Allow an empty location name on the command line to indicate to
    TQSL that the log submitted for signing has valid station
    location data (ADIF MY_xxx fields) and that no station location
    should be used

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Apr 13 06:51:50 UTC 2024 - Wojciech Kazubski <wk@ire.pw.edu.pl>

- Update to version 2.7.3
  * Detect cases where the user’s computer clock is set
    incorrectly. Rather than generating a meaningless “cannot
    load authority certificate” error, TQSL now tells the user
    if their clock is set far into the past or into the future.
  * Attempts to load expired and replaced callsign certificates
    now display a better explanation of the issue and provide a
    URL for downloading a current set of the user’s callsign
    certificates.
  * Change "some QSOs suppressed" wording for log uploads to
    "some QSOs not processed".
  * Pre-load a set of authority certificates into the TQSL
    certificate store to allow certificates that were bundled with
    the wrong authorities to be accepted.
  * Fixed the check that was being incorrectly applied to portable
    calls for US operations
  * The Callsign Certificate display used to state “Awaiting ARRL
    action” for pending callsign certificates, including ones that
    Logbook had rejected. TQSL no longer uses this label.
  * Correct handling of an empty upload tracking database. If the
    file exists but has no content, TQSL deletes it and recreates
    the database.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Dec 31 16:25:07 UTC 2023 - Wojciech Kazubski <wk@ire.pw.edu.pl>
- update to version 2.7.2
  * Handle locked upload tracking databases properly. When more
    than one copy of TQSL is running, detect that and provide an
    error messaging asking to complete other uploads.
  * For some errors being triggered when processing an ADIF file
    before any QSO data was read, TQSL would print a random line
    number. TQSL now always initializes the line number properly.
  * If the uploads database is corrupt, TQSL would emit spurious
    error messages on exit due to the automatic backup operation
    being performed. This is no longer displayed.
  * When the uploads database was locked, TQSL would lock up and
    not proceed when attempting to sign a log. TQSL now handles this
    and emits a reasonable error message.
  * Detect and repair the uploads database for cases where an empty
    file had been created. TQSL now deletes that file and creates
    a new uploads database rather than aborting signing the log.
  * When installing a new version of the TQSL configuration file,
    TQSL could reference memory areas that had been released,
    leading to crashes. TQSL now releases this memory properly.
  * Detect cases where the user’s computer clock is set incorrectly.
    Rather than generating a meaningless “cannot load authority
    certificate” error, TQSL now tells the user if their clock is
    set far into the past or into the future.
  * TQSL would generate error messages when identical QSOs appear
    in an ADIF log. It now handles duplicate QSOs properly.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec  6 19:59:57 UTC 2023 - Wojciech Kazubski <wk@ire.pw.edu.pl>

- Fixed desktop categories

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct 19 19:37:53 UTC 2023 - Wojciech Kazubski <wk@ire.pw.edu.pl>

- update to version 2.7.1
  * When upload a Callsign Certificate to Logbook, TQSL now decodes
    error messages properly
  * Portable callsign handling has been corrected so they work as
    Logbook expects.
  * When handling requests for US-based 1x1 callsigns, TQSL would
    always check in the FCC ULS database to see if the callsign is
    valid.
  * TQSL no longer uses BerkeleyDB as Oracle it frequently
    corrupted the database.
  * TQSL now does not use the OPERATOR field when it is too long
    to be a callsign.
  * Update the encryption algorithm used for saving callsign
    certificates (P12 files) from RC2 to AES-256.
  * Correct issues with the TQSL ADIF editor where some modes (PKT,
    PAC, FM) were not processed properly.
  * Add a preference that allows ignoring callsigns in ADIF files
    being signed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 15 21:15:51 UTC 2022 - Wojciech Kazubski <wk@ire.pw.edu.pl>

- update to version 2.6.5
  * Correct handling of portable callsigns correctly when they’re
    in the USA. The previous correction wasn’t complete.
  * Don’t allow illogical combinations of CQ and ITU zones. When a
    user changes DXCC entity, state, province, etc. only allow
    correct combinations.
  * Stop using the wxWidgets pulldown menu system because Microsoft
    broke handling of pulldown menus for Windows 11 22H2 release.
  * Allow malformed Cabrillo files with CR (Carriage Return) line
    endings, to accommodate very old Mac loggers.
  * When the database used to track uploaded QSOs is found to be
    corrupted, be more aggressive about deleting It and recreating.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun 20 17:29:52 UTC 2022 - Wojciech Kazubski <wk@ire.pw.edu.pl>

- update to version 2.6.4
  * Correct the cause of a crash when TQSL detects an expiring
    callsign certificate and the user chooses to renew that
    certificate.
  * When signing a log, TQSL checks if there are any valid callsign
    certificates for that call before allowing signing to proceed.
    This check caused station locations with “None” as their callsign
    to be rejected when signing a log. This is now corrected to
    permit the station location to be used.
  * When checking callsign validity, allow both “K1MU/KH6” and
    “KH6/K1MU” forms of the portable

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May 30 17:37:19 UTC 2022 - Wojciech Kazubski <wk@ire.pw.edu.pl>

- update to version 2.6.3
  * Corrections for a defect found since TQSL 2.6 was released
  * Some less critical updates.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 19 18:50:04 UTC 2022 - Wojciech Kazubski <wk@ire.pw.edu.pl>

- update to version 2.6.2
  * Several minor usability updates were implemented.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 11 19:27:21 UTC 2022 - Wojciech Kazubski <wk@ire.pw.edu.pl>

- update to version 2.6.1
  * This release includes an update to correct a defect that could
    cause TQSL to “hang” and never complete signing a log when
    previously submitted QSOs were submitted for signing.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr 26 21:51:31 UTC 2022 - Wojciech Kazubski <wk@ire.pw.edu.pl>

- update to version 2.6
  * There were no serious defects reported for TQSL 2.5.9. This
    release contains several minor updates which have accumulated
    since 2.5.9.
- improved install section of makefile, some workarounds removed 
  from specfile

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Nov  6 23:20:35 UTC 2021 - Wojciech Kazubski <wk@ire.pw.edu.pl>

- update to version 2.5.9
  *Defects Corrected:
    * When signing an ADIF log containing QTH information (such
      as MY_STATE, MY_COUNTY), TQSL can be configured to either
      report differences between the log and the selected station
      location, update the station location, or ignore the
      differences. TQSL now follows the preference settings.
    + When defining a “mode map” for ADIF modes which are not
      supported by TQSL, any modes which contained a slash would
      not be stored properly or act as expected. TQSL now supports
      these modes.
  * The localizations for “Chinese (Traditional)” and
    “Chinese (Simplified)” were reversed. TQSL now uses
    the proper translations.
  * TQSL now accepts both “C” and “S” as valid string types.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jul 31 22:25:02 UTC 2021 - Wojciech Kazubski <wk@ire.pw.edu.pl>

- update to version 2.5.8
  * The format of IOTA entries is now validated. This is a strict
    format validation, as in the IOTA must be a continent followed
    by a hyphen and a number, such as “AF-001”.
  * The display of the last usable date of a Callsign Certificate
    now shows the date of the last QSO that can be signed, as that’s
    much more useful information than the expiration date in many
    cases, as the Callsign Certificate cannot be used past that date.
  * TQSL now accepts “AO-07” as a valid name for satellite “AO-7”.
  * The Russian Oblast “YN” was incorrectly coded in the LoTW 
    configuration file as abbreviation “JN”. TQSL now accepts the
    proper value and translates “JN” into “YN” properly.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec  2 23:44:25 UTC 2020 - Wojciech Kazubski <wk@ire.pw.edu.pl>

- update to version 2.5.7
  * corrected a problem that can cause TQSL to crash when attempting
    to upload a log.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Nov 15 14:52:43 UTC 2020 - Wojciech Kazubski <wk@ire.pw.edu.pl>

- update to version 2.5.6
  * includes an update to the most recent TQSL configuration file.
  * fixad an incompatible change in command-line log handling,
  * fixed a bug that could cause the ADIF editor to lose files being
    edited,
  * fixed potential crash in TQSL.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 24 22:36:47 UTC 2020 - Wojciech Kazubski <wk@ire.pw.edu.pl>

- update to version 2.5.5
  * includes an update to the most recent TQSL configuration file.
  * corrected a defects related to handling callsigns where a
    lower-case call did not match the same call but in upper case only
  * an issue related to installing .P12 files, where restoring one
    would silently fail in some circumstances (expired CA certificate)
    was fixed

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun 12 23:22:56 UTC 2020 - Wojciech Kazubski <wk@ire.pw.edu.pl>

- update to version 2.5.4
  * LoTW and TQSL now both properly enforce a 20 character limit
    for callsigns.
  * TQSL now properly selects the right callsign certificate when
    multiple callsign certificates with the same callsign for
    more than one DXCC entity exists.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Apr 19 14:26:13 UTC 2020 - Wojciech Kazubski <wk@ire.pw.edu.pl>

- update to version 2.5.3
  * fixed issue with long callsigns; LoTW and TQSL now both properly
    enforce a 20 character limit. 
  * fixed issue related to operators with multiple callsign
    certificates with the same callsign for more than one DXCC
    entity.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr 13 13:45:36 UTC 2020 - Wojciech Kazubski <wk@ire.pw.edu.pl>

- update to version 2.5.2
- Defects Corrected:
  * fixed verifying a US callsigns if the data from the FCC had
    become corrupted
  * TQSL now reports when it is unable to open the files needed to
    connect to Logbook
  * when https (Secure) connections to Logbook fail, tqsl now falls
    back to trying insecure (http) requests
  * ensure that expired or otherwise invalid certificates in the
    chain verifying a user Callsign Certificate are properly
    reported.
- Major feature Additions:
  * When a log is signed by TQSL, the station details (Callsign,
    DXCC entity, Gridsquare and other QTH details provided by the
    selected Station Location (and Callsign Certificate) are
    compared to the details provided by the log. 
  * a station performing roaming operations can choose to have TQSL
    assume that the log is correct
- Minor Updates:
  * add diagnostic log lines suggested by David, W1HKJ,
  * fix centering of date fields in the date range prompt dialog box,
  * when a user is changing the language, the current language is
    now selected in the language selection dialog.
  * TQSL now handles Unicode/UTF-8 format “Cabrillo” files by
    ignoring the extra bytes before the "START-OF-LOG" signal.
  * if a BAND is provided for a QSO along with a FREQ, where that
    frequency (or receive frequency) is outside the related ham band,
    ignore the FREQ setting.
  * ensure that messages from TQSL are properly translatable – some
    long messages were not entirely translated.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Nov 16 19:01:50 UTC 2019 - Wojciech Kazubski <wk@ire.pw.edu.pl>

- update to version 2.5.1
- Defects Corrected:
  * TQSL no longer displays a spurious error message about expired
    root certificates when installing a .tq6 file
  * When editing an existing station location, TQSL no longer
    forces default values for information fields.
  * Correct ADIF output from the embedded ADIF editor so the
    proper mode/submode formation is generated.
  * Correct a defect that could cause TQSL to crash when backing up
    to a .TBK file.
- Major feature Additions:
  * Use an ARRL-supplied web service with ULS data to pre-fill
    station location information.
  * TQSL no longer asks for passwords for callsign certificates when
    they are created. There is a preference setting to re-enable this
    if desired.
  * When submitting requests for US 1x1 callsigns, which must always
    be a signed request, ensure that the flow properly marks the
    callsign as 1x1, and that the requester has a valid callsign
    certificate that can be used to sign that request.
- Minor Updates:
  * When listing DXCC entities, the list now has the deleted entities
    moved to the end. The word “DELETED” in the entity name is now localizable.
  * Replace the term “duplicate” when referring to QSOs which have
    already been uploaded to LoTW – calling them “previously uploaded” is
    less confusing as it says what’s wrong with those QSOs.
  * Verify that the user has the ability to write files to the TQSL
    working directory when TQSL starts up.
  * Update the icon for a “Waiting for Callsign Certificate” from a
    slashed circle to a clock.
  * Restrict the number of callsign certificate requests that a
    user can submit to 3 times in 24 hours.
  * When creating a callsign certificate request, TQSL now asks what
    kind of callsign this is for first so the rest of the questions
    are relevant to that callsign.
  * When an ADIF file has a BAND as well as a FREQ (frequency) or
    RX_FREQ (receive frequency) where the band is valid but the frequency
    is outside the band, the frequency is now ignored.
  * The error message displayed when a callsign certificate’s
    private key is missing is now more descriptive.
  * Translations updated.

Sun Apr 28 11:26:55 UTC 2019 - Wojciech Kazubski <wk@ire.pw.edu.pl>

- update to version 2.4.7

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr 22 11:36:54 UTC 2019 - Wojciech Kazubski <wk@ire.pw.edu.pl>

- update to version 2.4.6
  Correct defect for Windows command line users where error messages
  about problems with submitted QSOs (out of date range, bad callsigns,
  etc) would be garbled so they were unreadable.
- update to version 2.4.5
  Fixed formatting of output from command-line operations on Windows
  systems.
- update to version 2.4.4
  Fixed issues with Hindi and Polish not displaying properly on
  Windows systems. Fix an error that was keeping the State and County
  from being defaulted when creating a new Station Location.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Dec 22 20:53:51 UTC 2018 - Wojciech Kazubski <wk@ire.pw.edu.pl>

- update to version 2.4.3
  Fixed a defect in the station location wizard that would cause
  state and county information (also province, etc.) to be lost
  when editing a station location.

- update to version 2.4.2
  Ensure that the exit status message emitted by TQSL appears in 
  English so logging programs can use that to detect exit status.
  In the past, this could have been output in the local language,
  making it more difficult for the calling program to detect whether
  or not there were any errors.

  Improve setting of ITU and CQ zones when defining a Station 
  Location. There were many cases where these were left empty, which
  means that Station Locations were more likely to not have zones
  defined.

  Fix issue with Windows updates of TQSL failing when the user's
  directory has a space embedded. Note that this is a forwards-looking
  fix: this defect is in the existing TQSL 2.4.1, so updates for users
  with spaces in their usernames will continue to fail until after 
  2.4.2 or 2.4.3 is installed.

  Remove spurious error message when run on a system where the local
  language is not supported.

- Features Added:
  When displaying a callsign certificate where the private key is 
  missing from the local system, specifically state that the private key
  is not found. Added a specific message for keys that cannot be opened
  to provide the root cause.

  Improve the error message for missing private keys to be more
  descriptive.

  Add the ability to map Cabrillo modes to user-specified ADIF modes
  using the cab_modes.dat file in the TQSL user directory. File has
  Cabrillo modes (two characters), then an ADIF mode, comma delimited.

  Default file is provided by TQSL and users can provide their own.

  Allow adding translations without making code changes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Nov 17 14:26:22 UTC 2018 - Wojciech Kazubski <wk@ire.pw.edu.pl>

- removed patches libdir.diff and clang_analyzer.diff
- update to version 2.4.1
  Display "No Private Key" versus an error message when displaying a callsign
  certificate with no installed private key.

  Fix defect that meant that some callsign certificates (those with missing
  private keys) could not be restored from a .TBK file containing a good copy.

  Fix defect that was causing callsign certificate renewals to have "null null
  null" as the Name in some conditions.

  Fix defect that was required deleting an existing callsign certificate before
  importing a replacement .P12 file

- update to version 2.4
  Add Hindi translation.

  Pre-load callsign certificate requests from the ARRL address data when it
  is available for a given callsign.

  Provide default gridsquare, state, and county for station locations when
  available from the ARRL address data. Validate that gridsquares are 
  consistent with the station's address.

  Retain all certificate private keys. Mark as deleted and allow them to be
  recovered. This allows the .TQ6 file downloaded from LoTW to always be used
  to recover a user's callsign certificate.

  Allow LMDB to be used with TQSL to work around Berkely DB licensing issues.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 18 22:05:08 UTC 2017 - dl8fcl@darc.de

- update to version 2.3.1
  Add the ADIF satellite name to the pulldown menu in the ADIF editor to allow
  satellites to be more easily looked up.

  Add 'Saving QSOs' to the messages to be translated.

  Add Finnish translation from Juhani, OH8MXL.

  When renewing a callsign certificate and backing up to earlier pages in the wizard,
  don't display a spurious certificate type selection page.

  When editing an ADIF file that has an invalid mode setting,
  notify the user that it is being ignored.

  Fix password prompt on systems with debug assertions enabled in wxWidgets.

  Correct the invocation of the Windows Installer when an update is available.

  Correct the counts reported when duplicate QSOs are found along with QSOs
  with other errors.

  Allow 'LIGHT' in a Cabrillo file to represent 300G and higher.

  When there are multiple signature specifications in the configuration file,
  choose the one with the highest version number.

  Allow TQSL to build against OpenSSL 1.1.0.

  Fix formatting of the messages that appear when QSOs change values
  in the station location for duplicate QSOs.

  Correct improperly formatted frequencies from ADIF files
  (values like '7.010.20') to remove the extra periods.

  Revert the change that stripped spaces in the TQSL configuration file as
  that caused newlines to be removed in places like the station_data file.

  Fix "OpenSSL error - bad end line" by ensuring that there's always
  a newline starting a new certificate.

  Add the ability to pull DXCC Entity valid date ranges to the TQSL
  configuration file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 21 00:12:37 UTC 2017 - dl8fcl@darc.de

- use %cmake macros

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Oct  8 19:35:20 UTC 2016 - dl8fcl@t-online.de

- update to version 2.3
  * more translations
  * A defect that could cause TQSL to fail to import a callsign
  certificate with "OpenSSL error - bad end line" has been corrected.
  * Creating callsign certificate requests for renewal or for new
  requests now verify that the "QSO start date" and "QSO end date"
  match the start and end date for operations from that DXCC entity.
  * When creating a new callsign certificate request, TQSL no longer
  asks if it should be "signed" or not. Instead, TQSL asks what the
  callsign certificate is meant for (personal call, dxpedition,
  club  call, etc.) and chooses the proper approach depending on
  the type of callsign.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May 23 08:35:03 UTC 2016 - dl8fcl@t-online.de

- update to version 2.2.2
  several bugfixes
  Italian, Japanese, Chinese translations 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 15 12:34:01 UTC 2016 - dl8fcl@t-online.de

- update to version 2.2.1
  1. Restoring an incorrect .TQ6 file when there is a pending callsign
  certificate request could cause the pending request to be deleted. TQSL now
  rejects the invalid TQ6 file and takes no other action.

  2. Updating the LoTW configuration file could fail if the user's home
  directory contained non-ASCII characters (Windows only).

  3. Ensure that the password prompt window appears on top of other windows
  when a password is requested while signing a log.

  4. Correct defect that would cause Cabrillo "Light" mode QSOs (300 GHz) to
  be rejected.

  5. Correct handling of unrecognized ADIF MODE/SUBMODE entries to allow
  user-defined modes to be used.

  6. Fix a defect on OSX that would cause an incorrect error message to be
  displayed when an incorrect password for a callsign certificate.

  New features:
  1. Allow an alternate layout for the user interface that moves the status
  log to a separate tab. This is useful for users with long lists of station
  locations or callsign certificates.

  2. Update the duplicates tracking to allow reporting of station location
  changes when the same QSO is signed from more than one station location.

  3. Update the ADIF editor to automatically select the appropriate band when
  a frequency is entered.

  4. Add "Replaced' and "Expired" tags  to the callsign certificate
  properties display.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec 31 15:31:25 UTC 2015 - dl8fcl@t-online.de

- update to version 2.2
  Allow the National Parks on the Air contest identifiers to be
  seamlessly added to Station Locations.
  No longer displays 'Invalid argument" when an incorrect password
  is entered when renewing a password-protected callsign certificate.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Nov  8 11:55:35 UTC 2015 - dl8fcl@darc.de

- update to version 2.1.3

  Revert change in the behavior for command line applications.
  TQSL 2.1 changed the behavior for ADIF files to open those with the
  TQSL ADIF editor versus signing them unless "-x" or "-q" were on
  the command line. This was an incompatible change that is not
  consistent with the documentation and was removed.

  Fix defect that could cause newly imported callsign certificates
  to be deleted after the import completed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Sep 27 21:45:11 UTC 2015 - dl8fcl@darc.de

- update to version 2.1.2
  Portuguese (Portugal) translations from Nuno, CT2IRY
  
  Correct command line parsing defect that causes TQSL to quit without
  signing a log unless a station location is provided on the command line.

  Correct the TQSL editor to not use the language settings for decimal
  points as ADIF requires "." as the decimal separator.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Sep 13 21:15:53 UTC 2015 - dl8fcl@darc.de
