  <title>Simple Indexer for GNU and POSIX Tar Files</title>
  <description>tarix is a simple indexer for GNU and POSIX tar files. The indexes allow fast
extraction of files in the archive, especially on seekable tape devices. The
index format is simple enough to be used from a rescue disk with only mt,
dd, and tar (though grep and sed would be very useful there).
