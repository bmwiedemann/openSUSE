%description
On systems using transactional-update it is not really possible due to
the read-only root filesystem to install tools to analyze problems in the
currently running system, a reboot is always required. Which makes it next
to impossible to debug such problems. toolbox is a small script that launches
a container to let you bring in your favorite debugging or admin tools in
such a system. The root filesystem can be found at /media/root.
