    <p>
      A 3D rally simulation with a great physics engine for drifting, over 100 maps, different terrain materials like dirt, asphalt, sand, ice etc. and various weather, light and fog conditions give this rally simulation the edge over many other free games. You need to make it through the maps in often tight time limits and can further improve by beating the recorded high scores. All attached single races must be finished in time in order to win an event, unlocking additional events and cars. Most maps are equipped with spoken co-driver notes and co-driver icons
