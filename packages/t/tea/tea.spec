%description
TEA is a Qt-based text editor. It supports reading FB2, ODT, RTF,
DOCX, Abiword, KWord KWD and SWX documents, though only writes out
plaintext. Image viewing is possible as well. It has a built-in
Midnight-Commander-style file manager, integrates spell checking
(aspell/hunspell), and syntax highlighting for a number of languages.
