Mon Aug 30 06:20:23 UTC 2021 - lars@linux-schulserver.de - 1.2.2

- update to 1.2.2
  + This is a maintenance release that fixes a long-standing bug in 
    handling sensors that may disappear at runtime (i.e. those 
    marked with optional: true). 
    An error in the logic surrounding that led to the 
    optional: setting effectively being ignored.
  + The systemd service file (thinkfan-wakeup.service) that is 
    responsible for notifying thinkfan when the system wakes up from 
    suspend, hibernate, etc, was faulty in that it would send the 
    notification just before going to sleep instead of just after 
    waking up. 
    In many configurations, that meant that the fans would return 
    to their default behavior after wakeup. 
    This release should fix that issue.
  + Sensors can now be marked as optional, so thinkfan won't fail 
    if there is an error reading from them. 
    Addresses issues #39, #41 and #44.
  + The thinkfan.conf manpage has been updated to thoroughly cover 
    the new YAML-based config syntax. The manpage for the old 
    (now deprecated) syntax was renamed to thinkfan.conf.legacy. 
    The legacy config examples were completely removed, and instead 
    we now have a single YAML example config that should 
    cover everything.
  + Numerous minor and not-so-minor stability and compatibility issues 
    have been fixed. Most importantly, on systemd-based systems, thinkfan 
    will now be notified before the system goes to sleep, hopefully 
    eliminating the sensor-read problems on wakeup reported by some users.
  + hwmon sensors can now be specified by name (thanks @akheron). 
    See examples/thinkfan.conf.yaml.
  + thinkfan should now also reinitialize correctly after hibernate and 
    hybrid-sleep (applies to systemd only).
  + The thinkfan systemd service now runs after sysinit.target, to make 
    sure all kernel drivers have been loaded.
  + Some stricter warnings from newer compilers should be fixed
  + The -p option should now parse its arguments correctly (thanks @mowgli)
- added thinkfan-rpmlintrc
- use new yaml file for configuration (needs user adjustments)
- new upstream URL
- avoid systemd override.conf:
  + added thinkfan-1.2.2-systemd.patch
  + added thinkfan-sysconfig file (see /etc/sysconfig/thinkfan in 
    the installed system)
