- update to version 2.3.3:
  - changes in version 2.3.1:
    - Fixed handle resource leak exhausting TPM resources.
  - changes in version 2.3.2:
    - Added cirrus CI specific config files to enable FreeBSD builds.
    - Changed test scripts to be more portable.
    - Changed include header paths specific to FreeBSD.
  - changes in version 2.3.1:
    - Provide meaningful exit codes on initialization failures.
    - Prevent systemd from starting the daemon before udev changes ownership
      of the TPM device node.
    - Prevent systemd from starting the daemon if there is no TPM device node.
    - Prevent systemd from restarting the daemon if it fails.

Wed Dec 11 11:55:13 UTC 2019 - matthias.gerstner@suse.com

- update to version 2.3.0:
  - changes in version 2.3.0:
    - Add '--enable-debug' flag to configure script to simplify debug builds.
      This relies on the AX_CHECK_ENABLE_DEBUG autoconf archive macro.
    - Replaced custom dynamic TCTI loading code with libtss2-tctildr from
      upstream tpm2-tss repo. (requires tpm2-0-tss version 2.3.0)
    - Explicitly set '-O2' optimization when using FORTIFY_SOURCE as required.
  - changes in version 2.2.0:
    - New configuration option `--disable-defaultflags/ added. This is
      for use for packaging for targets that do not support the default
      compilation / linking flags.
    - Use private dependencies properly in pkg-config metadata for TCTI.
    - Refactor daemon main module to enable better handling of error
      conditions and enable more thorough unit testing.
    - Updated dependencies to ensure compatibility with pkg-config fixes
      in tpm2-tss.
    - Fixed bug causing TCTI to block when used by libtss2-sys built with
      partial reads enabled.
    - Removed unnecessary libs / flags for pthreads in the TCTI pkg-config.
    - Output from configure script now accurately describes the state of the
      flags that govern the integration tests.
- drop fix_dlopen.patch: no longer necessary since abrmd not uses the tctildr
  shared library. This one hopefully now does the right thing.

- update to version 2.1.1:
  - changes in version 2.1.1:
    - Unit tests accessing dbus have been fixed to use mock functions. Unit
    tests no longer depend on dbus.
    - Race condition between client connections and dbus proxy object
    creation by registering bus name after instantiation of the proxy object.

- bsc#1130588: Require shadow instead of old pwdutils

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar  6 10:36:46 UTC 2019 - matthias.gerstner@suse.com

- update to version 2.1.0:
  - changes in version 2.1.0:
    - `-Wstrict-overflow=5` now used in default CFLAGS.
    - Handling of `TPM2_RC_CONTEXT_GAP` on behalf of users.
    - Convert `TPM2_PT_CONTEXT_GAP_MAX` response from lower layer to
      `UINT32_MAX`
    - travis-ci now uses 'xenial' builder
    - Significant refactoring of TCTI handling code.
    - `--install` added to ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS to install aclocal required macros
      instead of using the default symlinks
    - Launch `dbus-run-session` in the automake test environment to
      automagically set up a dbus session bus instance when one isn't present.
    - Bug caused by unloading of `libtss2-tcti-tabrmd.so` on dlclose. GLib
    does not support reloading a second time.
    - Bug causing `-fstack-protector-all` to be used on systems with core
      libraries (i.e. libc) that do not support it. This caused failures at
      link-time.
    - Unnecessary symbols from libtest utility library no longer included in
      TCTI library.
  - changes  in version 2.0.3:
    - Update build to account for upstream change to glib '.pc' files
      described in: https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/issues/1521
- added _service file for syncing with upstream tags

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct 25 09:00:40 UTC 2018 - matthias.gerstner@suse.com

- add a Requires towards tpm2-0-tss, because that main package holds the udev
  rules and logic for setting up the tss user. Without this the daemon can't
  start up correctly.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct 23 15:46:28 UTC 2018 - matthias.gerstner@suse.com

- fix broken build due to newer glib dependency that reports a full path for
  gdbus-codegen, breaking the configure check.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 26 15:51:01 UTC 2018 - matthias.gerstner@suse.com

- update to version 2.0.2 (FATE#326270):
  - --enable-integration option to configure script now works as documented.
  - Format specifier with wrong size in util module.
  - Initialize TCTI context to 0 before setting values. This will cause all
    members that aren't explicitly initialized by be 0.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep 18 09:05:24 UTC 2018 - matthias.gerstner@suse.com

- add recommends to the tcti-device and tcti-abrmd. Otherwise they're not
  installed right away, rendering the abrmd quite unusable.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug 10 10:02:21 UTC 2018 - matthias.gerstner@suse.com

- Update to version 2.0.1:
  * SessionList: Fix Connection object reference leak.
  * source/sink: Organize ControlMessage processing.
  * CommandSource: Replace 'connection-removed' signal with ControlMessage.
  * SessionList: Remove all locking.
  * ConnectionManager: Remove 'connection-removed' signal.
  * ci: Build 'check' target when CC is gcc.
  * build: Fix bad URLs in configure script.
  * CHANGELOG.md: Add version number and date for 2.0.1 release.
  * Replace references to drand48_r family of functions for portability
  * Fix for type-punned pointer reported in newer compilers that enforce strict aliasing

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul  3 09:15:27 UTC 2018 - matthias.gerstner@suse.com

- Trying to fix build on older distros that fail because of a missing or
  broken autoconf valgrind detection macro. Removing  autoreconf to hopefully
  fix this.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul  2 09:27:43 UTC 2018 - matthias.gerstner@suse.com

- add fix_dlopen.patch: fixes an issue with dlopen()'ing the tcti-device
  library from tpm2-0-tss. See
  https://github.com/tpm2-software/tpm2-abrmd/issues/486.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Thu Feb 22 11:34:51 UTC 2018 - matthias.gerstner@suse.com

- update to upstream version 1.2.0:
  - Limit maximum number of active sessions per connection with '--max-sessions'.
  - Flush all transient objects and sessions on daemon start with '--flush-all'.
  - Allow passing of sessions across connections with ContextSave / Load.

    This fixes a memory leak in the TCTI library.
- correctly trigger udev to update /dev/tpm* permissions after package
  installation. (bnc#1078687)
- prepared support_dbus_activation.diff patch which adds D-Bus activation, but
  can't use it yet due to rpmlint

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov 15 11:43:19 UTC 2017 - matthias.gerstner@suse.com

- fix_service_paths.diff: fixed broken systemd service unit (bnc#1066123). the
  service unit file in the upstream distribution tarball is already configured
  and looks for binaries and configuration files in the /usr/local prefix
  which is wrong.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep  1 14:37:48 UTC 2017 - matthias.gerstner@suse.com

- package version symlink correctly, belongs into the lib package itself, not
  the -devel.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug 30 08:29:07 UTC 2017 - matthias.gerstner@suse.com

- update to upstream version 1.1.1 which fixes some local denial-of-service
  security issues among other things:

  - Replace use of sigaction with g_unix_signal_* stuff from glib.
  - Rewrite of INSTALL.md including info on custom configure script options.
  - Default value for --with-simulatorbin configure option has been removed.
  New default behavior is to disable integration tests.
  - CommandSource will no longer reject commands without parameters.
  - Unit tests updated to use cmocka v1.0.0 API.
  - Integration tests now run daemon under valgrind memcheck and fail when
  errors are found.
  - CommandSource now tracks max FD in set of client FDs to prevent unnecessary
  iterations over FD_SETSIZE fds.

- no longer call bootstrap and switch to the release upstream tarball which
  has now been fixed to contain all necessary files

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul 20 13:04:41 UTC 2017 - matthias.gerstner@suse.com

- first version of the new arbmd resource manager from Intel's tpm2 stack.
  This will replace the old resourcemgr previously shipped with the
  tpm2-0-tss package.
