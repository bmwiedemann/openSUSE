+Subpackage tar-tests
+====================
+
+The tar-tests package contains the testsuite which is included in tar sources.
+The testsuite is normally run during make phase (make check) and is also
+automatically run when the tar rpm is being build (in %check section of spec
+file).
+
+Normally, there is no reason to need the tar-tests package. It can however be
+used to verify, that tar functions properly in an installed system (e.g. to
+find issues in tar's dependencies, problems with incompatible libraries, etc.).
+
+Testsuite is installed into /var/lib/tests/tar
+
+To run the testsuite:
+
+cd /var/lib/tests/tar
+./testsuite --help # show options
+
+# needed for genfile binary used in tests
+./testsuite AUTOTEST_PATH=/var/lib/tests/tar/bin [other options]
+
