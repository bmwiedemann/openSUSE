  <title>GNU implementation of tar ((t)ape (ar)chiver)</title>
  <description>This package normally also includes the program &quot;rmt&quot;, which provides
remote tape drive control. Since there are compatible versions of 'rmt'
in either the 'star' package or the 'dump' package, we didn't put 'rmt'
into this package. If you are planning to use the remote tape features
provided by tar you have to also install the 'dump' or the 'star'
package.</description>
