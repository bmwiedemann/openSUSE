  list operators, more
- Improved encryption support including AES encryption,
  encryption/decryption streams, support for AAD and MACs
  Improved HTTPS and SSL security support with addition
  X.509 certificate support including automatic certificate
  verification in client and server contexts

- Add qore-libtool-2.4.6.patch: Remove imported Libtool 2.4.2
  macros from acinclude.m4: this is a terrible hack by upstream to
  not forcibly depend on libtool >= 2.4.2, which has a very bad
  side effect now with libtool 2.4.6 available: the macros conflict
  due the internal API changes inside libtool.
