Fri Sep  3 22:13:39 UTC 2021 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 0.94.0
  *  Initial support for playing the 'Quake 2021 re-release'
     content.
  *  Fix rendering bug when cl_bobcycle was set to zero.
  *  Fixed buffer overflow with large char skybox names.
  *  Fixed a missing MAXALIASFRAMES bounds check.
  *  OpenGL: workaround Intel UHD 600 driver bug.
  *  OpenGL: merged surface mark & cull optimizations from vkQuake.
  *  Compensate viewmodel distortion at fov > 90.
  *  Raised MAX_GLTEXTURES limit from 2048 to 4096 for now.
  *  Changed 'model has a skin taller than 480' error into a
     warning.
  *  Reject lit files if they're the wrong size (eg hipnotic/
     start.bsp vs id1/start.lit or just a bsp that no longer has
     any coloured lits, etc)
  *  External ent files are now versioned using 4 digit crc of the
     original map's ents, like e1m1@c49d.ent, which is much safer.
     The old method (e.g. e1m1.ent) still works but isn't
     recommended.
  *  Support for external vis files.
  *  Save: remove CR/LFs from level name to avoids broken saves,
     e.g.  with autumn_sp map.
  *  Music: improvements to mp3 tag detection / skipping.
  *  Music: umx loader fix for malformed / crafted files.
  *  New console command music_jump: Jump to given order in music,
     like Unreal's music change - only for module (tracker) music.
  *  Updated third-party libraries (music codecs, SDL, etc.) Other
     minor fixes, tidy-ups and protability tweaks.

    BLOCK_WIDTH/HEIGHT raised from 128 to 256.
  * Fixed several uncheked limits that would crash the Slayer's
    Testaments mod
  * Raised MAXALIASTRIS from 2048 to 4096, so that the Slayer's
    Testaments mod works.
  * Fixed 'pants' and 'shirt' types so that those textures load
    correctly on platforms where char is unsigned by default
  â€¢ Update the third-party libraries. Other fixes/cleanups.

     customizations to a new "cl_alwaysrun" cvar: Set to 1 in order to

   - off        (cl_alwaysrun 0, cl_forwardspeed 200, cl_backspeed 200)

     (from MarkV).
  *  New "find" / "apropos" command, searches for commands/cvar names
     for the given substring (from Spike).
  *  New "randmap" command for loading a random map.
  *  New "gl_cshiftpercent_contents", "gl_cshiftpercent_damage",
     "gl_cshiftpercent_bonus", "gl_cshiftpercent_powerup" cvars for
