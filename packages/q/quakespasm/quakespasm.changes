    BLOCK_WIDTH/HEIGHT raised from 128 to 256.
  * Fixed several uncheked limits that would crash the Slayer's
    Testaments mod
  * Raised MAXALIASTRIS from 2048 to 4096, so that the Slayer's
    Testaments mod works.

     customizations to a new "cl_alwaysrun" cvar: Set to 1 in order to
     scale forward/side/up speed by "cl_movespeedkey" (usually 2), and
     to make "speedkey" act as "slowkey".
  *  Change "always run" menu option to offer three choices:
   - off        (cl_alwaysrun 0, cl_forwardspeed 200, cl_backspeed 200)

     (from MarkV).

     for the given substring (from Spike).

     "gl_cshiftpercent_bonus", "gl_cshiftpercent_powerup" cvars for
