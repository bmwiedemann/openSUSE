  <title>Multi-purpose cross-platform desktop calculator.</title>
  <description>Qalculate! is a multi-purpose cross-platform desktop calculator. It is simple to use but provides
power and versatility normally reserved for complicated math packages, as well as useful tools
for everyday needs (such as currency conversion and percent calculation). Features include a
large library of customizable functions, unit calculations and conversion, symbolic calculations
(including integrals and equations), arbitrary precision, uncertainty propagation, interval
arithmetic, plotting, and a user-friendly interface (GTK+ and CLI).
