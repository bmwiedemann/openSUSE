- Update to version 0.5.4
  * Graph port-type colors are now configurable (cf. menu
    View > Colors.
  * Make Graph nodes (ie. client boxes) transparent for yet
    some eye-candiness ;). Also keep the (Graph) current
    selection across port (dis)connections.
  * Drawing patchbay connector lines as (bezier) curves is
    now a difinitive and fixed feature (as long as no more
    remains from the so called "Cambric explosion era" are
    still lurking in there).
  * AppStream metadata updated to be the most compliant with
    latest freedesktop.org specification and recommendation.
  * Graph auto-layout improvement for brand new node clients.

  * Regression to new Graph node/ports sorting comparator;
    also fixed multiple and many port removals, most probably
    causing it to crash due to double-free/delete potential.
  * Fixed the automatic aggregation of new Graph client nodes
    that are split as either input or output only (ie. system,
    terminal, physical or otherwise non-duplex nodes).
  * Added View/Zoom Range mode option to Graph tool.
  version 0.5.1
  * Half a decade later, recent new custom entries may now get
    removed from Session Infra-client list.
  * Some rather old, better said "Cambric explosion era", user
    preference options have been ditched altogether: Display /
    Time Format; Display / Shiny glass light effect; Display /
    Connections/Draw connections and patchbay lines as Bezier
    curves; Misc/Configure as temporary server.
  * A brand new and way long overdue connections Graph widget
    is finally introduced, only to be accessible through the
    context menu at this time.
  * Extended multi-selection is now supported on all Connections
    client/port lists, allowing for multiple (dis)connections at
    once.

    file (formerly AppData).
  version 0.4.5
  * On some desktop-shells, the system tray icon blinking on
    XRUN ocurrences, have been found responsible to excessive
    CPU usage, an "eye-candy" effect which is now optional as
    far as Setup/Display/Blink server mode indicator goes.
  * Added French man page (by Olivier Humbert, thanks).
  * Make builds reproducible byte for byte, by getting rid of
    the configure build date and time stamps.
  version 0.4.4
  * Fixed an early crash when the singleton/unique application
    instance setup option is turned off.
  * Almost complete overhaul on the configure script command
    line options, wrt. installation directories specification,
    eg. --prefix, --bindir, --libdir, --datadir and --mandir.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar  6 13:27:45 UTC 2014 - stephan.barth@suse.com

  This patch removes the absolute path of the qjackctl binary from the desktop
  file, that is in %{_datadir}/applications/%{name}.desktop
  (This was not mentioned in the previous submission)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan 03 09:47:35 UTC 2014 - pascal.bleser@opensuse.org

- update to 0.3.11:
  * interface device selection is now unified, by moving the old '>' pop-up
    menu into the customized combo-box drop-down list showing all available

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Aug  7 16:07:46 UTC 2011 - mseben@gmail.com

- update to 0.3.8:
  - Debugging stacktrace now applies to all working threads.
  - Session "Save" button now a drop-down menu, replacing the
    session save type combo-box/drop-down list selection. Also,
    an early session directory versioning/numbering scheme is
    now in place, although optional.
  - Probable fix to debian bug report #624198 - segfault when
    pressing the stop button (by Grant Adrian Diffey, after a
    patch from Adrian Knoth, thanks).
  - Desktop environment session shutdown (eg. logout) is now
    tapped for graceful application exit, even though the main
    window is active (visible) and minimizing to system tray
    is enabled. Both were causing first shutdown/logout attempt
    to abort. Not anymore, hopefully ;).
  - Make sure all activated patchbay definition files are in
    their complete and absolute directory path forms.
  - Connections refresh button now does an immediate and true
    reconstruction of all clients and their respective ports
    and connections, unconditionally.
  - Command line server start option (-s, --start) is now made
    independent from configuration setup option (cf. Setup/Misc
    /Start JACK audio server on application startup).
  - Now handling cable socket types properly to let patchbay
    definitions work correctly, whenever having sockets with
    the very same literal name (twisted from patch #3183467,
    by Karsten, thanks;).
  - Abrupt focus behavior when any of the keyboard modifiers
    (Shift, Ctrl, Alt, Caps Lock) is hit while on Connections
    client/port aliases editing (rename) has been fixed.
  - Russian (ru) translation updated (by Alexandre Prokoudine).
  - Added include "errno.h" alegedly missing for BSD style
    systems (applying patch for bug #3126091).


-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec  1 08:18:15 UTC 2010 - mseben@gmail.com

- updated to 0.3.7:
  - Session widget has session save type preserved as well.
  - Connections and the new Messages/Status widgets now have
    their last open tab preserved across program run-cycles.
  - Connections and Patchbay widgets have been finally given
    up on an old feature request: an Expand All items button.
  - The Messages and Status widgets were merged into one,
    giving space to the new Session wigdet
  - libX11 is now being added explicitly to the build link
    phase
  - Input/Output latency options were missing but now finally
    enabled for the firewire back-end.
  - General standard dialog buttons layout is now in place.
  - Avoid pre-loading a stalled patchbay definition filename
    and its nagging error on startup (fixes bug #3017078).
  - Client connection retrial logic scrapped. Being a leftover
    from early ages, when machines were slower and JACK server
    startup times were longer... now, if it can't connect first
    time as client, it will tear down the server whether it's
    starting up still or not at all. (cf. Setup/Settings/Start
    Delay for the rescue).
  - Server name is finally part of the server settings presets,
    thanks to Fons Adriaensen for the heads-up.
  - As a workaround regarding issues switching jack2's backends,
    Robin Gareus sends us yet another D-Bus metho slot: "preset",
    (dbus-send --system / org.rncbc.qjackctl.preset string:PRESET).
    Thanks again.
  - Another D-Bus interface slot makes it through implementation:
    "quit" (eg. usage: dbus-send --system / org.rncbc.qjackctl.quit).
    Besides, there's also these new JACK session management actions
    which were being overlooked as well: "load", "save", "savequit"
    and "savetemplate" are also available as D-Bus method slots.
  - Make sure that Patchbay socket names are unique when adding
    or copying, fixing previous patch by Dominic Sacre.
  - JACK version is now being shown on the About box (jack2).
  - Slight Connections widget behavioral change: (dis)connecting a
    client (from) to one single port, (dis)connections will be
    applied in sequence from (to) all client output ports to (from)
    as many input ports there are in below, one by one (satisfying
    a 5 year old request from Yann Orlarey, thanks:).
  - JACK session support is being introduced.
  - Ignore first XRUN occurrence option dropped from statistics.
  - Initial widget geometry and visibility persistence logic has
    been slightly revised as much to avoid crash failures due to
    wrong main widget hidden state.
  - Double-quotes are now being added to device names which include
    blank characters and were rendering invalid all command line
    invocation of the classic JACK server (eg. specially due for
    Portaudio device names on Windows).
  - Transport play (rolling) status is now being guarded to avoid
    backfiring from extraneous transport state changes.
  - General source tree layout and build configuration change.
  - Italian (it) translation added (by Sergio Atzori).
  - Post-shutdown script invocation logic slightly refactored in
    attempt to enforce its execution on application quit.
- deprecated translation-folder.diff

  default; use of -R is now deprecated from the jackd command line
  interface options; use -r to run in non-real-time-scheduling.
- A man page has beed added.
- Got rid of a pretty old and never really useful "jackd-realtime"
  server path option.
- D-Bus support, as provided by org.jackaudio.service aka jackdbus,
  is now being introduced and used wherever available and whenever
  enabled.
- Server name command line option added (-n, --server-name).
- Single application instance restriction option added (X11).
- Setup for the netjack (slave) "net" driver has now sample-rate
  and frames per buffer (period size) settings disabled and/or
  ignored, as those are pretty much auto-detected by default;
  also, a new "netone" backend driver option has been introduced
- Czech (cs) translation added (by Pavel Fric).
- Fixed glitch on configure portaudio support, specially when the
  library is not detected as available. See changelog for more.

Mon Nov 16 19:43:44 UTC 2009 - mseben@novell.com

- updated to 0.3.5:
  * Late support for UTF-8 encoded client/port names.
  * Allow only one single patchbay connection to or from an
    exclusive socket.
  * Automatic crash-dump reports, debugger stack-traces (gdb),
    back-traces, whatever, are being introduced as a brand new configure
    option (--enable-stacktrace) and default enabled on debug build
    targets (--enable-debug).
  * Probable fix on the audio connections with regard to client/port
    (re)name changes (an ancient bug reported by Fons Adriaensen).
  * Portaudio device selector is now available (after a patch
    handed by Torben Hohn and Stephane Letz).
  * A couple of primitive D-Bus interface slots have been introduced,
    giving the option to start/stop the jackd server from the system
    bus eg. via dbus-send --system / org.rncbc.qjackctl.start (.stop),
    (a nice addition supplied by Robin Gareus, thanks).
  * New command line option (-a, --active-patchbay=path) to specify and
    activate a given patchbay definition file (a simple patch sent by
    John Schneiderman, thanks).
  * Added one significant digit to DSP Load percentage status display.
  * Tentative support for netjack (slave) by adding the "net" driver to
    the existing backend driver options on the Setup/Settings section.
  * Converted obsolete QMessageBox forms to standard buttons.
  * New patchbay snapshot now raises the dirty flag and allows for
    the immediate salvage of patchbay definition profile.
  * Conditional build for JACK port aliases support (JACK >= 0.109.2).
  * Alternate icon sizes other than default 16x16, are now effective to
    the Connections widget (Setup/Dislay/Connections Window/Icon size).

  * ALSA PCM devices now only listed/enumerated iif strictly
    compliant with the audio mode criteria
  * JACK client/port aliases may now be displayed as a global user
    option (see Setup/Display/Connections/JACK client/port aliases).
  * Lighten up the connections line and highlight colors, as seen
    to fit best on some darker background themes.
  * Patchbay snapshot fixed to differentiate socket clients
    according to its type (Audio, MIDI or ALSA-Seq).
  * JACK_DEFAULT_SERVER environment variable is now appended to the
    X11 unique application identifier, allowing for having multiple
    instances each controlling its own JACK server.
  * Due to some trouble with newer Qt >= 4.4 applications regarding
    font size configuration, a new global user option is now
    available to the rescue: Setup/Misc/Defaults/Base font size
- moved translation path from locale directory to its own one,
  as build doesn't accept it (yet).
