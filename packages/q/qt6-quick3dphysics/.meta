  <title>Qt 6 Quick3D Physics Extensions</title>
  <description>This module adds physical simulation capabilities on top of Qt Quick 3D.
In particular, it enables rigid body simulation using simple primitives as well
as convex- and triangle meshes and heightmaps. Physical properties such as mass,
density, gravity and friction are customizable. This makes it possible to create
physically correct behavior in 3D scenes without having to handcraft animations.
