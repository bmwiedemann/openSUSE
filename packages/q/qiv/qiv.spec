%description
The "Quick Image Viewer" (qiv) is a GDK/Imlib image viewer similar to
viewers like xv or xloadimage. qiv features setting an image as an
x11 background with a user-definable background color, fullscreen
viewing, a screensaver mode, brightness/contrast/gamma correction,
real transparency, zoom and slideshow.

It creates only one window, containing only the image to view.
