- Ensure neutrality of description. Trim manual from description.
  In fact, switch the description to the one used by qiv-1.6.spec
  directly from upstream. (This is apparently the only file by
  upstream to ever have contained a description.)

    when deleting images

  * Fix occasionally erratic behaviour of qiv statusbar
  * Fix xpm autodetection with libmagic
  * Fix small artefacts in pictures which might happen when running
    remote over slow link
  * update image after it is exposed in window mode

    it was entered in non jumping mode
