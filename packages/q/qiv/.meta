  <title>Probably the fastest and simplest image viewer on the planet</title>
  <description>Qiv is a very small and pretty fast gdk/Imlib image viewer, designed to
view large images such as the JPEG files from today's high-megapixel
digicams.

It is super-easy to use: It creates only one window, containing only
the image to view, the SPACE key views the next image, BACKSPACE the
previous, &quot;d&quot; moves the current image to .qiv-trash/, &quot;u&quot; moves it back
and removes .qiv-trash/ if empty. &quot;f&quot; or the -f option toggles
full-screen mode and &quot;m&quot; toggles between maxpect mode (rescales images
to screen size while preserving aspect ratio) and unscaled mode with
unscaled 1:1 view with panning using cursor keys.

The mouse buttons can also be used in parallel to SPACE and BACKSPACE
to quickly flip thru images.

Furhter features are: * setting image as x11 background
   (centered,tiled,stretched..), with user settable background color

* external &quot;qiv-command&quot; program support

* screensaver mode

* brightness/contrast/gamma correction

* real transparency

* slideshow (with random order if you want)

* flip horizontal/vertical, rotate left/right

* delete function (move to .qiv-trash/)

* jump to image number x, jump forward/backward x images</description>
