- Update to 1.0
  * A greeter dialog was added, similar to the ones used by cgoban or gGo.
  * There is now a "Learn Go" button that brings up beginner tutorials
    in a slideshow view.
  * Engine configuration in the preferences is a little more friendly.
  * Edit mode works differently. Depending on the situation, an edited
    position can be appended to or inserted before the current node,
    or replace a previous edit.
  * The board window now has menu items for undo/redo.
  * When playing on IGS, the comments box now allows chatting even after
    a match has completed, making it unnecessary to find the opponent's talk tab.
  * Corrected a bug when parsing nmatch preferences on IGS.
- Drop patches, now upstream:
  * 0001-Disable-game-tree-header-with-Qt-5.10.patch
  * 0001-Remove-PlaceholderText-colorroles-which-were-added-b.patch
