  * Performance improvements when loading and editing
    very large SGF files.

    for a full set of menus.
  * The program is more helpful when detecting a broken SGF
    written by Jago.

    in the preferences.
  * Score evaluations are now shown in the board window when
    analysis is on.

    or replace a previous edit.
