- Update to 1.1

  * Performance improvements when loading and editing
    very large SGF files.
  * q5go can now detect when an observed game on IGS is
    adjourned and restarted and follow it in the same window.
    This requires the server to be set to non-quiet mode.
  * When playing an engine, there is now a "Play again" button.
  * In an online match with Canadian time, time warnings can
    now be enabled for remaining average time, not just
    remaining total time.
  * In an online match, remaining seconds in low time situations
    can now be shown on the opponent's last placed stone.
  * Added a "Go terminology" SGF to the tutorials.
  * The greeter window now has a hint to choose "Play online"
    for a full set of menus.
  * The program is more helpful when detecting a broken SGF
    written by Jago.
  * Added more helpful error messages when editing servers
    in the preferences.
  * Score evaluations are now shown in the board window when
    analysis is on.
  * Added a feature to visualize connected stones by drawing thick
    lines between them. May be helpful for beginners.
  * GTP support was extended to support board sizes > 25, for KataGo.

- Update to 1.0
  * A greeter dialog was added, similar to the ones used by cgoban or gGo.
  * There is now a "Learn Go" button that brings up beginner tutorials
    in a slideshow view.
  * Engine configuration in the preferences is a little more friendly.
  * Edit mode works differently. Depending on the situation, an edited
    position can be appended to or inserted before the current node,
    or replace a previous edit.
  * The board window now has menu items for undo/redo.
  * When playing on IGS, the comments box now allows chatting even after
    a match has completed, making it unnecessary to find the opponent's talk tab.
  * Corrected a bug when parsing nmatch preferences on IGS.
