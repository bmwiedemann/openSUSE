-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 12 20:36:48 UTC 2017 - fabian@ritter-vogt.de

- Update to 0.9.10:
  * Unit conversion fixes (e.g. "1/s to ms" and "1/ns to GHz")
  * Fixed parsing of degrees sign (used in defult symbol for temperature units)
- Update to 0.9.9:
  * libqalculate will no longer cause segmentation faults when using a locale unsupported by the users system
  * Parsing of "today" fixed and "tomorrow" and "yesterday" added
  * Qalculate! now compiles, without errors and warning, using clang
  * New commands/options in qalc which list available variables, functions and units
  * New command in qalcfor deletion of variables
- Update to 0.9.8:
  * Lots of bug fixes and minor improvements
  * Three different parsing modes can be chosen from (providing mainly different handling of implicit multiplication). The default 'adaptive' mode has been enhanced.
  * By default prefixes will not be added to for example imperial units.
  * Changed handling of degrees Celsius and Fahrenheit. Conversion will take place already during parsing.
  * When converting to unit without prefix, no prefix will be added to the result unless the unit expression is prepended with '?' ('0' works in the opposite direction).
  * Option to ignore commas in numbers (for use as thousands separator).
  * Possibility to abort slow number printing without using crash prone thread cancellation (use Calculator::startPrintControl() and related functions).
  * New function: fibonacci (Qalculate! can now tell you that the millionth fibonacci number is approximately 1,953282129 * 10^208987, although for obvious reasons the exact number cannot be displayed).
  * New units: Hartree, Rydberg, Dalton (same as u)
  * Currencies have been updated to reflect the available data from ECB.
  * Physical constant have been updated with the CODATA values from 2014.
  * Use ~/.local and ~/.conf to store configuration and definitions
  * 'to' can now not only be used for conversion to unit expressions. "to bin", "to oct", "to hex" and "to bases" changes number base displayed, "to factors" factorizes, "to fraction" displays as fraction, and "to base" and "to optimal" auto-converts units. (CLI)
