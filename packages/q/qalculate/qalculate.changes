  * Option to ignore commas in numbers (for use as thousands separator).
  * Possibility to abort slow number printing without using crash prone thread cancellation (use Calculator::startPrintControl() and related functions).
  * New function: fibonacci (Qalculate! can now tell you that the millionth fibonacci number is approximately 1,953282129 * 10^208987, although for obvious reasons the exact number cannot be displayed).
  * New units: Hartree, Rydberg, Dalton (same as u)
  * Currencies have been updated to reflect the available data from ECB.
  * Physical constant have been updated with the CODATA values from 2014.
  * Use ~/.local and ~/.conf to store configuration and definitions
  * 'to' can now not only be used for conversion to unit expressions. "to bin", "to oct", "to hex" and "to bases" changes number base displayed, "to factors" factorizes, "to fraction" displays as fraction, and "to base" and "to optimal" auto-converts units. (CLI)
