  <title>Powerful Calulator application</title>
  <description>Qalculate! is a modern multi-purpose desktop calculator for GNU/Linux. It is
small and simple to use but with much power and versatility underneath.
Features include customizable functions, units, arbitrary precision, plotting,
and a graphical interface that uses a one-line fault-tolerant expression entry
(although it supports optional traditional buttons).
This is the commandline interface, named qalc.</description>
