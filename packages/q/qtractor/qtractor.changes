Sat Jan 28 16:19:39 UTC 2023 - Dirk M端ller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 0.9.31:
  * Fixed a off-by-one rounding error on MIDI clip offset and lengths
  that were leaving some clips unlinked on load.
  * LXVST_PATH environment variable now accrues to VST_PATH for Linux-
  native VST2 plug-ins search path and not taking over in precedence
  anymore.
  * Fixed an old mistake on custom aliased CLAP and VST3 plugin paths.
  * Plugin latency/delay compensation now in effect immediately after
  changing track option (cf. Track/Properties... /Plugins/Latency
  compensation).

  * Improved MIDI queue time drift correction resilience and stability
  against in-flight tempo changes.
  * The main real-time process cycle now runs on uniform block-sizes,
  in strides of 64 frames per period, meaning a higher resolution
  automation, independent of buffer-size.
  * The internal main MIDI engine gets its ALSA sequencer queue to a
  higher resolution (PPQN aka ticks-per-beat) and not subordinated
  to the current session's anymore.
  * Although being deprecated to use, JACK Session support is hopefuly
  fixed, once again.
  * Better discriminate CLAP Plug-in specific note events and strict
  MIDI dialect event processing.

  - Session directory auto-name option added to the session properties
    dialog, as convenience.
  - Loading and saving a LV2 plugin's state has been vastly improved.

    brought up as top-level windows immediately when a track is made
    current or highlighted (and Track / Auto Monitor is in effect).

    note line on main view (piano-roll eye-candy++); also, the white
    keys on MIDI clip editor's virtual piano keyboard, are now fully
    highlighted.

    kind of 'non-functional' plugins accidentally.
  - Bring the Track Export dialog down to Clip Merge/Export as well,
    for optional file type and format selection.

    parameter and bailing out always with default SMF format anyway.
  - Fixed VST3 component/controller inter-connection.
  - LV2 Atom/Port-event host notification support has been retouched,
    but still unofficial though.
  - Fixed VST3 audio-processor initialization/activation when a plugin
    has no inputs or outputs present.

  (cf. View/Drum Mode).
 *Extended multi-selection is now supported on all the
  Connections client/port lists, allowing for multiple
  (dis)connections at once.
 *Added LV2 UI sample-rate option support.

    dockable-widget on the main application window (cf. main menu
    View / Window / File System).

    another quick means to open a new session or add new tracks to
    the current session.
  * MIDI input/capture time-stamping has been fixed as much to
    avoid missing inbound events, when play-head is near the loop
    end point and the loop-start is set below the absolute first
    half-a-second (<0.5sec).

    in audio export aka freewheeling mode.
  * Added *.SF3 to soundfont instrument files filter, on the

Thu May 11 10:45:42 UTC 2017 - ecsos@opensuse.org

- Update to 0.8.2
  - Track-name uniqueness is now being enforced, by adding an 
    auto-incremental number suffix whenever necessary.
  - Attempt to raise an internal transient file-name registry to 
    prevent automation/curve files to proliferate across several 
    session load/save (re)cycles.
  - Track-height resizing now meets immediate visual feedback.
  - A brand new user preference global option is now available: 
    View/Options.../Plugins/Editor/Select plug-in's editor (GUI)

  __TIME__ anymore.
- Upstream changes:
- The View/Options.../Display/Dialogs/Use native dialogs
  option is now set initially off by default.
- All tempo and time-signature labels are now displayed
  with one decimal digit, as it was in mostly everywhere
  else but the time ruler/scale headers.
- JACK transport tempo and time-signature changes are now
  accepted, even though playback is not currently rolling;
  also, changing (JACK) Timebase master setting (cf.View/
  Options.../General/Transport/Timebase) will take effect
  immediately, not needing nor warning for session restart
  anymore.
- Track/Navigate/Next and Previous menu commands, finally
  fixed to wrap around the current track list.
- Current session (JACK) transport mode option switching is
  now being made accessible, from the main menu and drop-down
  toolbar buttons, as well as user configurable PC-keyboard
  and/or MIDI controller shortcuts (cf. Transport/Mode/None,
  Slave, Master, Full).
- Fixed some auto-backward play-head position flip-flopping,
  when opening a new session while the previous was still on
  rolling/playing state, hopefully.
- Added French man page (by Olivier Humbert, thanks).
- MIDI clip changes are now saved unconditionally whenever
  the editor (piano-roll) is closed or not currently visible.
- Audio clip peak/waveform files re-generation performance,
  scalability and resilience have been slightly improved.

  waveform re-generation routine, as much to avoid empty,
  blank, zero or negative-width faulty renderings.
- Do not reset the Files tree-view widgets anymore, when
  leaving any drag-and-drop operation (annoyingly, all
  groups and sub-groups were being closed without appeal).
- Make builds reproducible byte for byte, by getting rid of
  the configure build date and time stamps.
- For more changes since 0.7.8 see:
  /usr/share/doc/packages/qtractor/ChangeLog

- refresh qtractor-nodatetime.patch
- Upstream changes:
  *MIDI file track names (and any other SMF META events) are now 
  converted to and from the base ASCII/Latin-1 encoding, as much to 
  prevent invalid SMF whenever non-Latin-1 UTF-8 encoded MIDI track
  names are given.
  *MIDI file tempo-map and location markers import/export is now 
  hopefully corrected, after almost a decade in mistake, regarding 
  MIDI resolution conversion, when different than current 
  session's setting (TPQN, ticks-per-quarter-note aka. 
  ticks-per-beat, etc.)
  *Introducing LV2 UI Show interface support for other types than 
  Qt, Gtk, X11 and lv2_external_ui.
  *Prevent any visual updates while exporting (freewheeling) audio 
  tracks that have at least one plugin activate state automation 
  enabled for playback (as much for not showing messages like 
  "QObject::connect: Cannot queue arguments of type 'QVector'"
  ... anymore).
  *The common buses management dialog (View/Buses...) sees the 
  superfluous Refresh button finally removed, while two new button 
  commands take its place: (move) Up and Down.
  *LV2 plug-in Patch support has been added and LV2 plug-ins 
  parameter properties manipulation is now accessible on the 
  generic plug-in properties dialog.
  *Fixed a recently introduced bug, that rendered all but one 
  plug-in instance to silence, affecting only DSSI plug-ins which 
  implement DSSI_Descriptor::run_multiple_synths() eg. 
  fluidsynth-dssi, hexter, etc.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 28 10:23:46 UTC 2016 - ecsos@opensuse.org

    dedicated audio output ports will keep default to the stereo 
    two channels.
  - Plug-in rescan option has been added to plug-ins selection 
    dialog (yet another suggestion by Frank Neumann, thanks).
  - Dropped the --enable-qt5 from configure as found redundant 
    given that's the build default anyway
  - Immediate visual sync has been added to main and MIDI clip 
    editor thumb-views
  - Fixed an old MIDI clip editor contents disappearing bug,
    which manifested when drawing free-hand 
    (ie. Edit/Select Mode/Edit Draw is on) over and behind its 
    start/beginning position (while in the lower view pane).

- update to 0.7.6
  - Plug-ins search path and out-of-process (aka. dummy) VST 
    plug-in inventory scanning has been heavily refactored.
  - Fixed and optimized all dummy processing for plugins with more
    audio inputs and/or outputs than channels on a track or bus 
    where it's inserted.
  - Fixed relative/absolute path mapping when saving/loading 
    custom LV2 Plug-in State Presets.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 22 11:01:56 UTC 2016 - ecsos@opensuse.org

- update to 0.7.5
  - Beat unit divisor, aka. the denominator or lower numeral in the 
    time-signature, have now a visible and practical effect over 
    the time-line, even though the standard MIDI tempo(BPM) is 
    always denoted in beats as quarter-notes (1/4, crotchet, 
    seminima) per minute.
  - Fixed an old hack on LV2 State Files abstract/relative 
    file-path mapping when saving custom LV2 Presets (after a 
    related issue on Fabla2, by Harry Van Haaren, thanks).
  - Default PC-Keyboard shortcuts may now be erasable and re- 
    assigned (cf. Help/Shortcuts...).
  - New option on the audio/MIDI export dialog, on whether to
    add/import the exported result as brand new track(s).
  - Introducing brand new track icons property.
  - Old Dry/Wet Insert and Aux-send pseudo-plugin parameters are 
    now split into separate Dry and Wet controls, what else could 
    it possibly be? :)
  - Brand new MIDI Insert and Aux-Send pseudo-plugins are now 
    implemented with very similar semantics as the respective and 
    existing audio counterparts.
  - Implement LV2_STATE__loadDefaultState feature (after pull 
    request by Hanspeter Portner aka. ventosus, thanks).
  - Plug-ins search paths internal logic has been refactored; an 
    alternative file-name based search is now in effect for LADSPA,
    DSSI and VST plug-ins, whenever not found on their original 
    file-path locations saved in a previous session.
  - Finally added this brand new menu Clip/Cross Fade command, 
    aimed on setting fade-in/out ranges properly, just as far to 
    (auto)cross-fade consecutive overlapping clips.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jan 30 07:58:18 UTC 2016 - ecsos@opensuse.org

    the main thumb-view.
  - Faster and crispier VST plugin editor (GUI) idle cycles.
  - Fixed all core processing when any plugin has more audio 
    outputs than channels on a track/bus where it's inserted.

    the MIDI Tools dialog.
  - Added brand new and global option to disable the so called 
    "catch-up" default behavior (cf. View/Controllers.../Sync).
  - Fixed some track control issues related to MIDI Controllers 
    generic mapping (cf. View/Controllers...).
  - Try making Help/Shortcuts... dialog window modeless, as far as
    under MIDI Controller, Inputs/Outputs Connections window also 
    gets accessible enough.
  - Fixed some vertical scrolling and play-head line re-drawing 
    glitches introduced by the recent unlimited slack to editing 
    beyond current contents length on main tracks view.
  - Added one decimal digit to the Pitch-shift spin-box on audio 
    Clip/Edit... properties dialog window.
  - Added application keywords to freedesktop.org's AppData.

    the beginning of session.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec 30 10:56:18 UTC 2015 - ecsos@opensuse.org

- update to 0.7.3
  - Slight increase on the number of decimal digits for the plugin
    parameters while on the generic plugin properties dialog. Also
    applied to automation curve node value editing.
  - Unlimited slack is now in effect on editing over and beyond
    the current session or clip contents length, on both the main
    tracks and MIDI clip editor (piano-roll) views.
  - Ctrl+click and dragging the left or right edges of a clip will
    now make it spill over and replicate as many clip clones as it
    fits in the left or right horizontal extent.
  - Added View/Note Type and Value Type command menus to the MIDI
    clip editor (aka. piano-roll) which opens the possibility for
    discrete shortcuts to switching views eg. Note Velocity and
    Controller views (after a kind request by yubatake, thanks).
  - Fixed the conversion and/or override of MIDI clip offsets when
    moving and copy/pasting across tempo/time-signature changes.
  - Fixed MIDI file track/channel duration estimator, which was
    giving quite wrong and way too short reads.
  - Fixed a drag-and-drop bug over the main tracks view, when new 
    tracks were being inserted at the top and not to the bottom as
   is normally indicated by the floating visual placeholder.
  - Fixed LV2UI_Resize handle from extension_data(LV2_UI__resize), 
    now passing LV2UI_Handle in first argument to ui_resize(), as
    found correct and needed for resizable/scaleable LV2 UI's, most
    specially to ssj71's so called Infamous Plugins, thanks.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

  - Fixed an ages old MIDI track/channel instrument mapping (bank,
    program) issue that prevented normal all-shut-up messages from
    being sent to MIDI output buses/ports on playback stop.

    in both ways a non-blocking pipe may get.
  - Fixed port on MIDI 14-bit controllers input caching.
  - Fixed false value readings on the MIDI clip editor (aka. piano
    -roll) tool-tips, when dragging a note velocity or controller
    value outside the acceptable nominal range (eg. 0-127).
  - Added LV2_BUF_SIZE__nominalBlockLength option support (patch
    by falktx aka. Filipe Coelho, thanks).
  - Fixed wrong initial tempo/time-signature display when session
    is loaded from command line.
  - LV2 plug-in UI GTK2 and X11 in Qt5 host native support added.
  - Transport/Auto Backward feature now honoring (auto return) to
    same current location precedence as Transport/Backward.
  - Single/unique application instance control adapted to Qt5/X11
    (cf. configure --enable-xunique).
  - MIDI Tools/Transpose, Resize duration display format (frames,
    time or BBT) have been fixed.
  - Build fix for Qt5.5 (patch by KaOS, thanks).
  - MIDI Tools/Quantize et al. are tentatively being corrected
    to take event times as relative to THE beginning of session,
    instead of MIDI clip start location.
- update to 0.7.0
  - Complete rewrite of Qt4 vs. Qt5 configure builds.
  - Revised MIDI Controlllers catch-up algorithm.
  - Mixer multi-row layout gets a little bit of a fairness fix.
  - Non-continuous MIDI Controllers now have their Hook and Latch
    options disabled as those are found not applicable,
  - As an alternative to PC-keyboard shortcuts, MIDI controllers
    are now also assignable and configurable for any of the main
    menu command actions, all from the same old configuration
    dialog (Help/Shortcuts...).
  - Fixed missing Track and Clip sub-menus from Edit/context-menu
    that were found AWOL ever since after the Lazy Tachyon beta
    release (> 0.6.6).
  - An off-by-one bar position (as in BBT, bar, beat and ticks)
    has been purportedly fixed as long as LV2 Time/Position atom
    event transfer goes.
  - French (fr) translation line to desktop file added (patch by
    Olivier Humbert, thanks).
  - A new top-level widget window geometry state save and restore
    sub-routine is now in effect.
  - Improved MIDI clip editor resilience across tempo and time-
    signature changes.
  - Keyboard shortcuts configuration (Help/Shortcuts...) now
    lists complete menu/action path where available.
  - Fixed in-flight VST plugin editor (GUI) resizing.
  - Added support to LV2UI_portMap extension, found really handy
    for the cases where you have multiple plugins with different
    port configurations and a single common UI to drive them all
    (pull request by Hanspeter Portner aka. ventosus, thanks).

-------------------------------------------------------------------

  * Fixing segfaults due to QClipboard::mimeData() returning an
    invalid null pointer while on Qt5 and Weston.
  * Return of an old hack/fix for some native VST plugins with
    GUI editor, on whether to skip the explicit shared library
    unloading on close and thus avoid some mysterious crashes
    on session and/or application exit.
  * Force reset of plugin selection list when any of the plugin
    search paths change (in View/Options.../Plugins/Paths).
  * Recursive VST plugin search is now in effect for inventory
    and discovery on path sub-directories (VST only).

    splitter pane sizes are now saved and restored properly.
  * Extended multi-selection is now featured on the track-list
    (main left-pane), primarily allowing for group mute/solo
    (and monitor) switching.
  * Track-list (left pane) header column widths are now saved
    and made persistent across application power cycle (double
    -click reverts to the old original default).
  * Minor fixes on the MIDI clip event list editor, also making
    sure the current event is visible on the piano-roll view.
  * As long to prevent asynchronous mistakes to JACK transport
    state changes, an internal slack-delay is now introduced
    after self-initiated transport commands (eg. start/stop).
  * The MIDI clip editor (aka. piano-roll) was missing to
    clear or reset the current selection when no shift/ctrl
    keyboard modifier is in effect.
  * VST-shell sub-plugins are now supported (as suggested by
    abique aka. Alexandre Bique, thanks).
  * MIDI clip record/overdubbing is now possible (Clip/Record
    on the main menu or File/Record from the MIDI clip editor.

- changes from 0.6.4:
  * Fixed some old loop-recording clip drawing glitches.

    names for MIDI controllers, note keys, RPN and NRPN,
    are now in effect on the MIDI clip editor drop-down
    lists, whether available.
  * Clip/Take/Range... input dialog values are now properly
    sanitized as long to prevent invalid take/folding ranges.
  * Audio capture/export file type default now set to "wav".
  * Extending punch-in/out over loop-recording/takes modes.
  * Make audio tracks monitoring always flow while playback
    is rolling, independently of their mute/solo state.

    shift/ctrl+click and drag one of its edges.
  * Fixed a typo causing FTBFS when VST plug-in support is
    explicity disabled (./configure --disable-vst).
- refresh qtractor-nodatetime.patch: line numbers changed
- add qtractor.appdata.xml to the package

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep 26 10:54:44 UTC 2014 - ecsos@schirra.net

- update to 0.6.3
  * Make the mouse-wheel to scroll the plugin list views, when
    not hovering a direct-access parameter slider.
  * Mixer widget gets (un)dockable Inputs and Outputs panels,
    also with their respective title captions.
  * Plugin instantiation is now constrained as much to prevent
    any audio channel output overriding.
  * Existing plugin presets may now be selected right(-click)
    from plugin list context-menu (ticket by Harry van Haaren,
    thanks).
  * So-called "painting" over multiple selected event values,
    while on the MIDI clip editor view pane below the main
    piano-roll (eg. note velocities, controller values, etc.)
    is now split into two similar painting modes, whether the
    sub-menu Edit/Select Mode/Edit Draw is set on (free-hand)
    or off (linear).
  * Drag-and-copy of plug-in instances across tracks or buses
    (ie. cloning) now also copies the direct access parameter
    setting (ticket by Holger Marzen, thanks).
  * File/Save As... now prompts and suggests an incremental
    backup name for existing sessions files.
  * Zooming in/out increment is now augmented by whether shift
    /ctrl keyboard modifiers are set (on a ticket request by
    Holger Marzen, thanks).
  * LV2 Time position event messages for plugin atom ports that
    support it is now being implemented.
  * Attempt to break extremely long audio file peak generation
    on session close or program exit (as reported by EternalX,
    thanks again).
  * MIDI Controllers Hook and Invert properties are now properly
    saved for tracks (after bug report by Nicola Pandini, thanks).
  * A segmentation fault when closing with VST plugins open has
    been hopefully fixed (after a patch by EternalX, thanks).
  * Messages standard output capture has been slightly improved
    as for non-blocking i/o, whenever available.
  * Automation curve node editing has been slightly improved
    in regard to time positioning and resolution.

- changes from 0.6.2
  * Prevent linear and spline automation curve modes for all
    integer valued subjects. Also, make sure those values are
    rounded to the nearest integer away from zero.
  * Fixed save of LV2 Presets for plugins with state files.
  * A man page has beed added (making up G端rkan Seng端n's work
    on debian, thanks).
  * When moving plugins by eg. drag-and-dropping across tracks,
    automation curves were being left behind, maybe leading to
    unpredictable mistaken behavior. Hopefully, not anymore.
  * Translations install directory change.
  * Automation curves are now automatically re-adjusted to tempo
    map node changes (after a ticket by Holger Marzen, thanks).
  * Audio/MIDI files or plugins found missing on session load
    are now subject for an explicit modal warning message and
    prompt for an immediate session backup salvage.
  * Changing instrument plugin programs is now an undo/redo-able
    command operation, especially for DSSI but also for plugins
    that come with the LV2 Programs interface extension support
    (http://kxstudio.sourceforge.net/ns/lv2ext/programs).
  * Drawing, selecting and/or resizing of MIDI note events that
    extend across tempo/time-signature changes is now made a bit
    more correctly over the MIDI clip editor (aka. piano-roll),
    especially regarding to current snap-to-beat setting (after
    an outstanding ticket by yubatake, thanks).
  * Once again, audio frame/MIDI time drift correction has been
    slightly refactored to improve MIDI input monitor and timing.
  * Discrete automation curve node values may now be edited via
    a numerical entry floating spin-box on double-click (as yet
    another request by AutoStatic aka. Jeremy Jongepier, thanks).
  * Pressing shift/ctrl keyboard modifiers while double-clicking
    on a plugin list entry now briefly reverses the current View
    /Options.../Plugins/Editor/Open plugin's editor (GUI) by
    default option preference.
  * Fixed an old crash lurker when switching output buses that
    implied a change on the number of audio channels, while on
    tracks that have (auto-)monitor turned on and at least one
    active plugin in chain (yet another ticket by AutoStatic
    aka. Jeremy Jongepier, thanks).
  * MIDI Controller assignment (aka MIDI learn) and/or automation
    of plugins (de)activation state has been added (as requested
    by AutoStatic aka. Jeremy Jongepier, thanks).
  * LV2 UI Idle and Show interfaces support added.
  * Allow the build system to include an user specified LDFLAGS
    (patch by Alessio Treglia aka. quadrispro, thanks).

- changes from 0.6.1
  * New user preference option added as View/Options.../Display
    /Transport/Hold auto-scrolling (follow play-head) on edits
    (after requests by Holger Marzen and Louigi Verona, thanks).
  * All color chooser dialogs were missing proper titles.
  * Audio peak file re-generation and clean-up has been hopefully
    fixed and cache optimized (re. drawing audio clip waveforms).
  * Fixed initial session snap-per-beat setting on main toolbar.
  * Clip/Export...'ed files are now made persistent, no questions
    asked (after a ticket by Oliver Kester, thanks).
  * Portuguese (pt) translation added (by Esteban Viveros, thanks).

- changes from 0.6.0
  * New user option added: on whether to save plugins automation
    values with higher resolution as possible, using 14-bit NRPN:
    cf. View/Options.../Plugins/Experimental/High resolution
    plugin automation (default=off).
  * Generic native plugin dialogs now shows an additional "About"
    last page where authorship credits are due.
  * A new user preference option is now in place for whether to
    use desktop environment's own native file requester/browser
    dialogs (View/Options.../Display/Dialogs/Use native dialogs).
  * A bit of slack have been introduced to put "Follow Playhead"
    (aka. auto-scroll view mode) on hold, while doing in-flight
    selection edit moves.
  * Fixed some user interface related annoyances while on the MIDI
    Controllers mappings (ie. View/Controllers...).
  * Fixed port origin on MIDI RPN/NRPN 14-bit controllers input.
  * A discretionary plug-in unique identifier have been devised for
    when more than one from the same type are inserted on a bus or
    track chain, avoiding destructive clashing of automation data.
  * Horizontal scrolling shift+mouse-wheel direction now reversed.
  * LV2 Dyn(amic)-manifest support is now optional (default=off);
    cf. View/Options.../Plugins/Experimental/LV2 Dynamic Manifest
    support).
  * The following options, although decieved on View/Options... as
    global configuration options, were always and still are proper
    session instance properties: (JACK) Transport mode, MMC mode,
    MMC device, MIDI SPP and MIDI Clock modes, are now shown there
    reflecting the current open session state.
  * A couple of run-time circumventions have been hacked in, both
    strictly related to when NSM session management is in charge:
    1) the new session template feature is disabled (was aborting
    initial NSM new client additions); 2) the native (as from the
    desktop environment eg. KDE) file browser/requester dialogs are
    disabled (were taking too long to list the current directory on
    first time invocation).
  * Update current automation/curve nodes selection while changing
    horizontal (time axis) zoom levels.
  * One liner's attempt to make it consistent behaviour on resizing
    and moving multiple selected notes or events while on the MIDI
    clip editor (aka. piano-roll; after a ticket request from Daniel
    MacDonald aka. danboid, thanks).
  * Introducing tiny quarter-note/crotchet/seminima/beat icon on all
    snap-to-beat selection items get a new icon :).
  * Corrected some audio buffering boundary conditions that were
    causing dead-loops/freezes while merging some audio clips.
  * Session auto-save period was chronically reduced to one third 
    of its user setting; non critical but fixed now.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan 03 10:24:52 UTC 2014 - pascal.bleser@opensuse.org

- package changes:
  * removed patch, merged upstream: qtractor-0.5.10-cflags.patch
  * added patch: qtractor-remove_path_from_exec_in_desktop_file.patch
    (fixes warning in build because the .desktop file uses the fully-qualified
    path to /usr/bin/qtractor)

- update to 0.5.12:
  * fixed another off-by-one MIDI plugin chain timing bug, delaying the actual
    playback of the first MIDI event, whenever it started at the same and as
    long as the initial play-head position
  * a new LV2 host convention is in effect on plugins that expose multiple
    AtomPort's in either direction: only the first input or output declared
    AtomPort is eligible to convey regular MIDI data events
  * zooming with shift/ctrl+mouse-wheel and pointing over the main tracks view
    or MIDI clip editor time ruler header's now fixed
  * a rare freezing loop condition has been fixed on the oldest of MIDI file
    save/write routines
  * copy/paste now preserving clip names
  * scaling of whole tempo map with a given factor has been added, through a
    spin-box and button in Tempo Map / Markers dialog
  * when issued from main tracks view (ie. Clip/Tools menu) MIDI clip tools are
    now a bit more crash-resilient re. undo/redo- ability
  * session auto-save / crash-recovery support is now on trial as in
    View/Options.../General/Session/Auto-save current working session every 10
    minutes (default on)
  * plugin-list chain context-menu now includes MIDI instrument audio output
    options to existing non-dedicated output buses, any other than the previous
    hard-wired default (eg. Master)
  * tracks export now allows for the mix-down/merge of multiple audio/MIDI
    output buses (Track/Export Tracks)
  * when adding new tracks, try preserving the last selected bus names, while
    not the default Master ones
  * brand new thumb-(over)view toolbar widget added to MIDI clip editor window
    (aka. piano-roll overview)
  * general MIDI RPN/NRPN 14-bit controller support is now being introduced on
    real-time MIDI input parsing, on standard MIDI file I/O, on MIDI Controller
    options and, of course, on MIDI clip and event list editor

- changes from 0.5.11
  * adding a track now inserts it after the current one, if any; one can also
    drag and move a track below the last one in the track list (main view left
    pane)
  * extended Edit/Select Mode/Automation: multi-selection mode, cut, copy,
    paste and delete of current track's automation curve nodes, now reached
    implementation ready status
  * another old silent bug bites the dust: changing track names were dropping
    any track gain/volume and panning automation curves when saving the session
  * a primeval processing bug has been sorted out: aux-sends to audio output
    buses that just appear to be after the input bus where they're inserted
    were being left muted and silent
  * fixed a sure crash bug exposed when processing of aux-send plugins when
    inserted too early on audio input buses chain
  * Shift/Ctrl keyboard modifiers now set to extend current clip selection
    while in main track view's Edit/Select Mode/Range, Rectangle modes
  * main Edit/Select Mode/Automation icon retouched to look a bit more obvious
    and intuitive, hopefully
  * allow to change the velocities/values of the current selected events which
    have the exact same onset times and hide beyhond each other on the MIDI
    clip editor's pane below the main view piano-roll (ie. the one that
    represents MIDI event values as a bar chart)
  * fixed some problematic playback/export muting and annoying cleanup
    freezing, due on audio tracks with too many clips eg. more than hundred
    clip splits
  * LV2 UI resize feature support/control added
  * fixed dedicated MIDI control and MIDI metronome port connection restore
    conflict
  * new user preference option added: reverse middle-button role to Shift/Ctrl
    keyboard state, in special regard to edit-head/tail vs. play-head
    positioning while on the main track and MIDI clip editor (aka. piano-roll)
    views

Wed Mar  7 17:29:19 UTC 2012 - prusnak@opensuse.org

- updated to 0.5.4
  * Direct access plugin/insert parameter changing tool-tip added.
  * A Transport/Panic action enters the scene, in a nostalgic attempt
    to emulate the all-MIDI-track-shut-off command of those drop-dead
    and primordial MIDI sequencers of all time. Now finally a keyboard
    shortcut and mouse click-away ;)
  * MIDI editor command redo/undo adjustment now effective on all other
    channel events besides notes, which overlap at the same event time.
  * A new File/Unlink menu action is now made available from the MIDI
    clip editor (aka. piano-roll) for detaching the current linked/ref-
    counted MIDI clip into a new auto-incremented SMF filename.
  * Some audio/MIDI content/media-file resource management is entering
    the scene, taking care of some file-system house-keeping, this gets
    evident on unsaved/dead recorded files being automaticaly removed
    from the file-system, on session close.
  * Killed the old and entirely deprecated LV2 Save/Restore and Persist
    feature/extensions support.
  * Auto-monitored MIDI events are now merged/queued correctly into
    the instrument plugin playback queue, avoiding sudden crashes, hopefully.
  * Awesome patch from Albert Graef, thanks, which makes most MIDI SysEx
    to get through MIDI instrument plugins at last; applies to DSSI and
    LV2 plugins only.
  * LV2 URID map/unmap feature support added.
  * Plugin parameter value redo/undo command aliasing fix.
  * Double-clicking in plugin list item now show/activates the plugin's
    editor window (was toggling visibility/activation).
  * Plugin path settings have been fixed again, with special regards to an
    effective LV2_PATH environment variable settlement.
  * Session properties dialog now asks to create a new session directory
    if the given one does not currently exist.
  * MIDI note names and their respective octave numbers are now compliant
    with the ISO standard where middle C (60) is now C4 (was C3).
  * Fixed audible glitch/pop at the beginning of an audio clip with long
    quadratic or cubic shaped fade-in (reported by Lougi Verona, thanks).
  * MIDI Controller Auto-Hook patch by Alessandro Preziosi, thanks.
  * Make sure all MIDI note-off are always queued after their respective
    note-on events when buffering for MIDI input of instrument plugins,
    event though for zero duration MIDI note events (hopefully fixing
    the hanging notes bug #3476124, as reported by Albert Graef, thanks).
  * LV2 MIDI-fx plugin support has been repaired.
  * Single-track clip selection logic corrected again, fixing multi-clip
    selection drag/move across an odd number of distinct tracks (after
    a bug report by Louigi Verona, on linux-audio-dev, thanks).
  * MMC Locate time-code hour bit-field fix; MMC Locate now also on loop
    turnarounds (patches by Albert Graef, thanks).
  * Looping across multiple linked/ref-counted audio clips was incredibly
    broken with complete out-of-sync playback. Hopefully fixed now, with
    auto-unlinking/cloning all the affected audio clip buffers.
  * Audio clip overlapping detection off-by-one(-frame) fix.
  * MIDI Tools/Resize value ramp mode has been added (mocking the 'resize
    to range' feature request #3467894, by Daniel MacDonald aka. danboid).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jan  8 18:03:02 UTC 2012 - prusnak@opensuse.org

- updated to 0.5.3
  * Fixed initial LV2 plugin UI widget/window titles.
  * Attempt to get any brand new LV2 plugins Qt4 enabled UI's
    working on either slv2 and lilv build modes ;)
    (nailed by falkTX, thanks).
  * Current clip is ultimately inferred from the one under
    the play-head position and current selected track;
    the last one clicked over and/or selected still has precedence
    (following request by Loiugi Verona).
  * Drag-moving clips horizontally with the keyboard arrow-keys
    just got a step better with a fixed minimum of one pixel,
    depending still on the current snap-per-beat setting and
    horizontal zoom level (as suggested by Louigi Verona, thanks).
  * Get maximum and minimum peak values back when drawing audio waveforms.
  * Automation play/feedback has been missed to show on those
    plugins that provide their own GUI, now on par with all the rest
    'homebrew' widgets (eg. generic plugin properties dialog).
  * All plugin parameters automation and selection were left
    inaccessible until the generic native plugin dialog is eventually
    shown, now fixed (re. bug #3463916).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jan  8 18:02:55 UTC 2012 - prusnak@opensuse.org

- updated to 0.5.2
  * Fixed a probably old lurking destructive bug, which was incidental
    to when an invalid or non audio file is imported, intentionally
    or by mistake, into new or existing audio clips (eg. importing
    a MIDI file where an audio file is expected).
  * Force audio file closing to occur on the very same disk-write (sync)
    thread, possibly mitigating an old random crash issue lurking
    in the vorbis reference encoder (recording) re. the non thread-safeness
    of the vorbis_analysis() final call.
  * Fixed extraordinary shadow-playback of audio clips which extent
    were longer than the respective audio file length.
  * Default session file format option now promoted
    (see View/Options.../General/Session) in the way of whether
    file suffix gets honored upon session open or save (.qtr, .qts or .qtz).
    This brand new option also applies for default state file format
    on a JACK-session salvage context.
  * The View/Options... (aka. user preferences) dialog sees a new
    arranjement in layout, with some options moving into this
    brand new tab page called General.
  * LV2 State extension support has been added, which shall replace old LV2
    Persist extension interface in the near future. It also replaces
    the LV2 Files extension from now on (thanks to Dave Robillard).
  * Dirty MIDI clips are now auto-saved when MIDI track properties
    get changed through its own dialog.
  * Fixed one probable too old crash when canceling a new/add track dialog.
  * MIDI SysEx event list editing is now fixed.
  * Once again, make sure all recorded clips start and end at the very
    same position when multiple track recording is turned on/off,
    while playback is still rolling.
  * Fixed Makefile.in handling installation directories to the configure
    script eg. --datadir, --localedir.
  * Possible attempt to improve in-flight recording clip display,
    especially when looping and MIDI clips are involved.
  * MIDI clip revision (re)numbering paranoia has been improved as much
    to avoid MIDI file clashes as much as possible while editing multiple
    MIDI clips which reference the same SMF and track/channel.
  * Creating new or updating existing buses with exact same names of any
    current dedicated inputs/outputs (which are implemented as special
    covert buses) is now disallowed (preventing bug #3430406).
  * Loop-recording/takes functionality is now ready for the masses and
    accessible from brand new Clip/Take menu (Select, First, Previous,
    Next, Last, Reset and Range...; the latter is actually being provided
    as bonus feature :) as to fold any given clip into so-called takes,
    simulating loop-recording mode over an arbitrary range).
  * Loop-recording/takes infrastructure integration is sneaking in:
    all clips recorded under a loop/cycle range may now get split (folded)
    into one or more so-called takes. A new option is now provided,
    as to select which take is about to retain after the recording ends,
    either the First or the Last one. Just turn this mode off (None)
    and keep with the old recording behavior, where clips are laid out
    unfolded through the timeline, as usual
    (see menu View/Options.../Display/Loop recording mode).
  * Improved robustness in face of disabled audio buses when global maximum
    number of JACK (audio) ports is surpassed (mitigating bug #3421911).
  * Improved single-track clip selection status logic, (possibly fixing
    bug #3419141).
  * Clip/Unlink action is now available for detaching linked/ref-counted
    MIDI clips, renaming and saving into auto-incremental SMF filenames.
  * Temporary session archive directory now (pre)fixed with program name
    (eg. /tmp/qtractor).
  * Fixed VST GUI editor window title on first show.
  * Fixed build for ancient VST-SDK 2.3 (32bit only).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct 12 07:53:32 UTC 2011 - mseben@gmail.com

- update to 0.5.1
  - More LADISH support: SIGTERM signal is now trapped for graceful
    application close.
  - Improved paste-repeat snap precision when dealing with large
    repeat counts.
  - Czech (cs) translation added, by Pavel Fric.
  - Added a few snap-to-beat divisors (unusual Beat/5, Beat/7,
    Beat/9 and Beat/10) for completeness sake.
  - Such a simple change of mind with a visual twist: the "A" track
    automation button/menu has now been
  - moved to the right-most, as it belongs ;)
  - Auto-connection of dedicated audio outputs is now optional
    for default audio master bus, metronome, player and MIDI
    instrument plugin dedicated audio outputs.
  - Finally, after a pitiful large brain-dead period, generic plugin
    forms are now showing all possible controllable plugin
    parameters featuring a paged, tabbed dialog, whenever applicable.
  - Special hack/fix for JUCE based native VST plugins, which are
    the most actually found with a GUI editor, skipping explicit
    shared library unloading and thus avoiding some mysterious
    crashes on session close and/or application exit.
  - Support for MIDI-fx plugins (native VST and/or LV2) is now
    implemented and functional (intra-chain only).
  - Instrument plugin bank/program selection was found broken or
    dead in the water, specially on VSTi, now finally fixed again.
  - VST plugin parameter value display on generic form is now
    back in business (were dead regarding value changes).
  - All plugin's provided GUI editors are now honored by being
    popped up first, instead of the usual but good old generic
    plugin form.
  - Long overdue implementation of a dedicated MIDI file player is
    now accessible from the MIDI files widget; one can play the
    whole SMF or just a single track or channel.
  - Update to a newer VeSTige header, probably fixing an old 32 vs. 64
    bit mismatch.
  - Avoid JACK session filenames/paths to be ever shown; also avoid
    all buses ports (re)connections when JACK sessions are (re)loaded,
    given the fact that session management will take care of just that;
    more also, untitled/default session names are now also picked up to
    match current LADISH project name, obviously given by LADISH_PROJECT_NAME
    environment variable, whenever present (as suggested by Nedko Ardaunov).
  - Paste-repeat floating selection has been fixed (was showing only the
    last repeated selection).
  - Coherence of tempo changes on audio and MIDI clips, whether automatic
    time-stretching is in effect, has been slightly improved, hopefully fixed.
  - Bold attempt to get linked (aka. ref-counted) audio and MIDI
    clips into practice (EXPERIMENTAL).
  - Main track view now showing all clips above the grid.
  - Added support for both new and older (deprecated URI) lv2_external_ui
    extension (by Nedko Ardaunov).
  - Following yet another great idea, and implementation, by Holger
    Dehnhardt, who already brought us the new aux-send insert plugin,
    thanks again, the so-called direct access control option is now
    featured for any plugin parameter right from plugin listings eg. mixer strips.
  - General resource consumption and management has been slightly
    improved, due to internal buses allocation optimization.
  - Fixed nasty crash-bug that was severely affecting all sessions
    that had at least one insert (pseudo-)plugin on any audio input bus.
  - All automation curve nodes are now relocated whenever disparate
    session sample-rate is detected on load.
  - New aux-send/insert pseudo-plugin is now introduced, allowing to
    route any track audio output to any other audio output bus
    besides the nominal one -- thanks to an original implementation from Holger Dehnhardt.
  - New immediate edit/loop-range settings from current clip extents,
    accessible on the main menu (Clip/Range Set, Loop Set) and from
    MIDI clip editor menu as well (File/Range Set, Loop Set).
  - MIDI Names XML files (*.midnam) may now be imported into MIDI
    instrument definitions. (EXPERIMENTAL)
  - Avoid cursor reset while editing MIDI events list (fixes bug #3380259,
    reported by Frank Neumann).
  - Just some typos fixing (patch #3378382 by c-korn).
  - Track view automation curve editing mode has been slightly fixed,
    now allowing for other previously existing point-and-click mouse operations.
  - Default automation curve mode is now preserved (following a
    suggestion by Alexandre Prokoudine, thanks).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug  5 07:34:22 UTC 2011 - mseben@gmail.com

- update to 0.5.0
  - MIDI controller learn/catch-up sees the way in:
    MIDI controller changes are now only effective
    after catching-up with their respective program
    parameters, avoiding abrupt jumps and keeping a
    safe and continuous behavior. (EXPERIMENTAL)
  - Track/Height menu is now featured, giving access
    to Increase, Decrease or Reset the current track
    height.
  - All changes to audio gain and panning on tracks
    and buses are now applied following a piece-wise
    linear ramp, reducing the old nasty clicks, pops
    or zipper artifacts that might be awfully audible
    on some situations, most specially on automation.
  - All zooming in/out is now relative to either the
    viewport center or current mouse cursor position
    if found laying inside.
  - TYOQA! the underground sources have emerged:...
    after years in the making, track automation, or
    dynamic curves as some like to call, is finally
    a reality, tricky but real ;)
  - Audio clip anti-glitch/ramp-smoothing effect is
    now slightly independent of current buffer-size
    period (mitigating bug #3338113 effect).
  - Once buried under the Edit menu, Clip menu has
    been finally promoted to top main menu.
  - Debugging stacktrace now applies to all working
    threads.
  - Fixed muted loop playback on audio clips ending
    coincidentally with the loop-turn/end point.
  - Old/deprecated JACK port latency support added
    to audio recording latency compensation.
  - Audio clip merge/export lock-ups now untangled
    (fixes bug #3308998).
  - LV2 extension headers update.
  - Fixed configure of newer LV2 host implementation
    stack (LILV) when older (SLV2) is not present.
- see http://qtractor.sourceforge.net/qtractor-downloads.html
  for all changes since 0.4.7

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Oct  3 22:10:16 UTC 2010 - davejplater@gmail.com

- Applied patch - qtractor-0.4.7.1-1.patch from upstream to fix 11.2
  build.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Oct  2 11:49:39 UTC 2010 - davejplater@gmail.com

- Update to version 0.4.7
- Upstream changes are too numerous to list for changes go to
  http://kde-apps.org/content/show.php/Qtractor?content=56325

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun 16 09:58:05 UTC 2010 - davejplater@gmail.com

- Update to version 0.4.6
- Introducing a non-painting edit sub-mode on the MIDI clip
  editor's piano-roll (see Edit/Select Mode/Edit Draw menu).
- The MIDI clip editor (aka piano-roll) is now a lot more
  quiet about saving its own dirty content, delegating all
  salvage questions to main session control.
- Don't show session restart message box when changing JACK
  transport mode option anymore.
- Dedicated MIDI control bus switching fixed. Was closing
  the wrong bus eventually and crashing the whole show with
  it (fixes bug #2989590).
- MIDI bank/program backout has been corrected on MIDI track
  properties dialog rejection (ie. user cancellation).
- MIDI bank select method has been corrected for tracks with
  no instrument defined (probably fixing bug #2987071).
- LV2 UI Instance and Data Access extension support added;
  reduce LV2 external UI parameter value update flickering.
- JACK session infrastructure support. (EXPERIMENTAL)
- Initial widget geometry and visibility persistence logic
  has been slightly revised as much to avoid crash failures
  due to wrong main widget hidden state.
- Initial mixer widget extents are now set reasonably larger.
- General source tree layout and build configuration change.
- See /usr/share/doc/packages/qtractor/ChangeLog for more.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 25 10:25:27 UTC 2010 - mseben@novell.com

- updated to version 0.4.5
  - Changing loop points while playback is rolling, with the
    play-head any near, was leaving audio clips out-of-sync.
  - MIDI event list view was missing some selected items with
    the very same onset time, now fixed.
  - When failing to detect a SSE enabled build, the CFLAGS
    variables are now properly restored to their previous
    sane state, preventing all subsequent dependency tests
    from false positives (bug# 565860@bugs.debian.org).
  - MIDI clip editor (aka piano-roll) multiple selection has
    been fixed (again) re. move/paste-snapping consistency.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 18 14:47:00 UTC 2010 - mseben@novell.com

- updated to version 0.4.4
  - For all the DSSI plugins that have output control ports,
    a host feedback/update process cycle is now being finally
    provided: all output control ports are now marshaled to
    their respective GUI process, rather often and when found
    open/visible.
  - MIDI clip editor (aka piano-roll) snap-to-beat behavior on
    edit mode is now kind of more like 'filling-in-the-blanks'
    (as Frank Neumann et al. wishes ;)

  - Fixed MIDI clip editor mistake when reverting to initial
    clip length, before closing and discard changes (thanks
    to Frank Neumann, for spotting this one).

  - LADISH Level 1 support has been added: SIGUSR1 signal trap
    just makes it a shortcut to File/Save.

  - Avoid parameter value flickering, due to duplicate command
    invocation, most evident when changing values massively on
    native Linux VSTi plugin editor GUIs (thanks to a detailed
    report on this odd behavior, from Mike of linuxDSP.co.uk).

  - Another TODO item bites the dust: MIDI event list editor,
    now acessible from the MIDI clip editor menu (View/Events)

  - Last used session directory is now made current on startup
    only when no filename is given on the command line (solving
    bug #2920244).

  - Current snap-to-beat setting (time quantization) now affects
    the anchor event only, while dragging, moving and/or pasting
    multiple events over the MIDI clip editor (aka piano-roll).

  - Make anti-glitch audio clip micro fade-in/outs independent
    from current buffer size as much as possible.

  - Audio/MIDI engine drift correction gets really sophisticated,
    with the help of (now old) ALSA MIDI tempo skew facility.

  - Edit/Clip/Import... menu option is now available for expedite
    clip insertion from audio and MIDI file requesters.

  - Set default session directory effective to file's location.

  - Audio track/clip recording process has been target to special
    refactorization across the internal audio engine process cycle,
    in a late attempt to get self-bounce/recording effective and
    working consistently for all track layouts.

  - All session related dialogs are now set to window modality,
    (were set to default application modality before) allowing
    for continued input focus and interaction on all plugin/tool
    windows.

  - An off-by-one nasty old bug fixed in audio clip drawing, was
    causing instant crashes on certain zoom levels of the main
    track view.

  - Graphical MIDI clip representation regarding note/pitch range is
    now kept as much as possible across clip edits (cut, copy, paste,
    drag, move, delete, etc.)

  - LV2 plug-in hosting has finally come into actual implementation;
    only some and the most basic LV2 plug-in features are supported
    at the moment; probably there's no big advantage against the old
    LADSPA ones; there's some support for external UIs though; also,
    LV2 MIDI/Event bare-bones support is included but chances are it
    won't build nor work right on most of the setups out there. It's
    a WIP host implementation anyways, as is the whole LV2 spec. for
    that matter ;)

  - Connections filter is now reset when widget is shown through the
    View/Connections main menu or toolbar button.

  - Audio bus auto-connection option is now applied when creating or
    updating, newer or existing buses, respectively.

  - Global configuration state is now explicitly saved/committed to
    disk whenever View/Options... dialog changes are applied or when
    a session is loaded or saved.

  - Audio ramping spin-locking makes its smooth stuff, in an attempt
    to reduce glitching and crackling when editing (due to its own
    pseudo spin-locking) and toggling playback states.

  - JACK Transport, MMC Device, and MIDI Song Position pointer (SPP)
    control modes are now made optional (View/Options...), allowing
    for discretionary configuration: None/Disabled, Slave/Input,
    Master/Output or Full/Duplex (default).

  - Session files may now be dragged and dropped over the main track
    view and get loaded for business as usual (once quietly ignored).

  - In an attempt to mitigate potential stack corruption and sudden
    crashes, old commented out session pseudo-locks are now back in
    business while executing clip editing commands (cut, paste, drag,
    move, insert, delete) and playback is currently rolling.

  - Adjusted first-time application window size to fit into 800x600
    screen size and with reasonable initial dockables layout.

  - Avoid duplicate snap-to-grid effect when changing the length of
    MIDI clip editor events across non-zero clip offsets (after a
    glitch reported by Ralf Mardorf).

  - Late audio track processing optimization, suppressing all plugin,
    mixer and monitor pass-through activity when given track is muted,
    either explicitly or implicitly (ie. other track is in solo state).

  - Entering System Exclusive events (SysEx) on the MIDI clip editor
    (aka matrix/piano-roll widget), yet something not fully supported
    anyway, even though allowed in edit mode, doesn't crash the whole
    damn thing anymore, while saving the clip to a file.

  - Strict aliasing avoidance, with plain and demanded use of 'union',
    as much as to stop nagging warnings from gcc >= 4.4.1 (last seen
    on src/qtractorMidiEvent.h hackery).

  - Visual correct play-head position while changing zoom levels,
    applicable to both main track and MIDI clip editor views.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov  5 08:28:00 UTC 2009 - mseben@novell.com

- updated to 0.4.3
 * External preset files are not removed nor deleted from the file-system anymore.
 * Connections support for UTF-8 encoded client/port names.
 * Force track and clip properties dialog widget to be modal as it should from their beginning dawn.
 * Audio effect send/return aux. inserts are implemented as special pseudo-plugins (Plugins/Inserts).
 * Reset play-head position on auto-backward and keep playback rolling when continue past end transport option is not set.
 * MIDI clip editor (aka piano-roll/matrix aditor) gets better on the virtual piano keyboard eye-candy side of things ;).
 * Plugins are now also referenced by label, avoiding plugin index clash/misses eg. when plugin object file/path changes or is moved externally.
 * Keyboard focus is now cleared/reset from the main toolbar time and tempo spin-boxes when editing gets finished (eg. Enter key is pressed).
 * First audio metronome beat/bar now played back correctly (fixes bug #2841437).
 * Client to/from port (dis)connections now found consistent as good ol'QjackCtl behavior (fixes bug #2834657).
 * All dirty open MIDI clip editors are now prompted to save before the main application closes (fixes bug #2835516).
 * Mixer level meters get their long deserved gradient look.
 * Fixed any ghost clip selections that were haunting the main track view, specially after undo/redo.
 * Increased tolerance on reading corrupt MIDI files (SMF).
 * A MIDI SysEx manager is being finally introduced, in some primordial rather basic form though.
 * A default MIDI instrument name may now be assigned to any MIDI output bus (see View/Buses.../MIDI).
 * More legacy headers, stdio.h and stdlib.h, are yet again necessary to build with gcc/g++ >= 4.4 (as patch noted by Alexis Ballier on Gentoo bug report #274168, thanks).
 * Bus manager dialog (View/Buses...) gets new columns on the left pane buses list as for displaying number of channels and bus mode.
 * Crash when updating bus probably fixed (bug #2811630).
 * Fixed glitch displaying beat snap/grid lines on MIDI clip editor, incidental to clips located at absolute zero time.
 * Overlapped MIDI clips were rendering garbled note events to DSSI/VSTi plugins, now fixed.
 * New MIDI Playback/Queue timer (resolution) option is now available (see View/Options.../MIDI).
 * MIDI instrument definitions may now be imported from plain SoundFont files.

   Exclusive (SysEx) event strings may now be freely assigned to MIDI output buses only, allowing for proper
   setup of external outboard MIDI equipment. Each bus may have an unlimited SysEx queue that gets sent out on every
   connection change (see View/Buses.../MIDI/SysEx...).
 * A default MIDI instrument name may now be assigned to any MIDI output bus (see View/Buses.../MIDI).
 * More legacy headers, stdio.h and stdlib.h, are yet again necessary to build with gcc/g++ >= 4.4 (as patch noted

- updated to version 0.4.2
 * The MIDI clip editor (piano-roll/matrix editor), the main track
   view as well, have been subject to usability fixing.
 * MIDI tracks channel bank/program and controller stuff are now
   only issued when the respective bus connections have changed,
   seldom on every playback start.
 * MIDI controller mapping infrastructure, with file based
   configuration management (see View/Controllers...), is now
   in place, following an original contribution from gizzmo aka Mathias Krause.
 * Plugin chain buffer reset on playback start/stop is not
   guarded by a momentary plugin de/activation anymore.
 * Clip export may now be applied to multiple clips, sharing
   common refactored code and same semantics as merging of
   current selected clips.
 * Improved, may be just fixed yet again, audio track export
   synchronization and reliability.
 * Clip merge is now featured both for audio and MIDI tracks.
 * Fixed the precision of multi-clip final positioning as result
   of drag/move and paste operations in main track view (as in bug #2741611).
 * MIDI track program number is now listed in 1-128 range.
 * MIDI editor snap grid lines get slight different color
   then regular beat divisions.
 * Reset local tempo map cursor on newer MIDI file imports
   in a tentative to fix incidental but random crashes.
