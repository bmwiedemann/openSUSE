    release.
  * Split config file in two parts. The main one will not change
    every time you open program.
  Bug fixes:
  * (important one) Fixed long startup times by moving
    videoplayer into a separate library that is loaded ondemand.
    I've seen some complaints about this, please give this
    version a try.
  * Fix some issues with mouse event handling.
  * Fix scaling working incorrectly for webp files.
  * Fix opening wrong directory when passed . as an argument.

    hang. Now it doesn't do that.
  * Saving PNG files will no longed produce huge file sizes.
