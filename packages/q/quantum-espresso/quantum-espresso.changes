- Add backports-6.4.1.git-diff: Backported fixes for version
  6.4.1 from upstream:
  * Bug in spin-polarized meta-GGA
  * Unphysical fractional translations (tau/n with n/=2,3,4,6)
    were not explicitly discarded, thus leading in unfortunate
    cases to strange values for FFT factors and grids. Also: if
    "nosym" is true, inversion symmetry flag (invsym) and info on
    FFT factors (fft_fact) must also be reset
  * PPACF wasn't working any longer in v.6.4 and 6.4.1 for nspin=2
    and for hybrid functionals
  * option "write_unkg" of pw2wannier90.f90 wasn't working as
    expected
  * Input parameters (for restarting DFPT+U calculations)
    read_dns_bare and d2ns_type were missing in the PH input
    namelist, and moreover they were not broadcasted.

- Update to version 6.4.1:
  * A warning is issued if the lattice parameter seems to be a
    conversion factor instead of a true lattice parameter.
  * A warning is issued if ibrav=0 is used for systems having
    symmetry.
  * [HP] the code was not working correctly when fractional
    translations were present
  * [HP] there was a bug in the case when either there is only one
    k point, or when k pools are used and some of the pools have
    only one k point.
  * Restart of ph.x with 2D boundary conditions has been fixed
    (see gitlab issue #102 (closed))
  * XML file correctly written if tetrahedra are used (see gitlab
    issue #103 (closed))
