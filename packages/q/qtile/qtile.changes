- Update to v0.22.1
  * GitHub tag is signed for those who need it
- from v0.22.0
  * !!! Config breakage !!! lazy.qtile.display_kb() no longer
    receives any arguments. If you passed it any arguments
    (which were ignored previously), remove them.
  * If you have a custom startup Python script that you use instead
    of `qtile start` and run init_log manually, the signature has
    changed. Please check the source for the updated arguments.
  * `KeyChord`'s signature has changed. ``mode`` is now a boolean
    to indicate whether the mode should persist.
    The ``name`` parameter should be used to name the chord
    (e.g. for the ``Chord`` widget).
  * Add ability to draw borders and add margins to the `Max` layout.
  * The default XWayland cursor is now set at startup to left_ptr,
    so an xsetroot call is not needed to avoid the ugly X cursor.
  * Wayland: primary clipboard should now behave same way as with
    X after selecting something it should be copied into clipboard
  * Add `resume` hook when computer resumes from sleep/suspend/hibernate.
  * Add `text_only` option for `LaunchBar` widget.
  * Add `force_update` command to `ThreadPoolText` widgets to simplify
    updating from key bindings
  * Add scrolling ability to `_TextBox`-based widgets.
  * Add player controls (via mouse callbacks) to `Mpris2` widget.
  * Wayland: input inhibitor protocol support added (pywayland>=0.4.14
    & pywlroots>=0.15.19)
  * Add commands to control Pomodoro widget.
  * Add icon theme support to `TaskList` widget (available on X11
    and Wayland backends).
  * Wayland: Use `qtile cmd-obj -o core -f get_inputs` to get
    input device identifiers for configuring inputs. Also input
    configs will be updated by config reloads (pywlroots>=0.15.21)
  * Widgets that are incompatible with a backend (e.g. Systray on
    Wayland) will no longer show as a ConfigError in the bar. Instead
    the widget is silently removed from the bar and a message
    included in the logs.
  * Reduce error messages in `StatusNotifier` widget from certain apps.
  * Reset colours in `Chord` widget
  * Prevent crash in `LaunchBar` when using SVG icons
  * Improve scrolling in `Mpris2` widget (options to repeat scrolling etc.)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Aug 21 23:44:05 UTC 2022 - John Vandenberg <jayvdb@gmail.com>

- Added _constraints file as tests need more memory
- Disabled many of the new tests due to failures reported upstream
- Update to v0.21.0:
  * Add `lazy.window.center()` command to center a floating window
    on the screen.
  * Wayland: added power-output-management-v1 protocol support,
    added idle protocol, added idle inhibit protocol
  * Add MonadThreeCol layout based on XMonad's ThreeColumns.
  * Add `lazy.screen.set_wallpaper` command.
  * Added ability to scale the battery icon's size
  * Add Spiral layout
  * Add `toggle` argument to `Window.togroup` with the same 
    functionality as in `Group.toscreen`.
  * Added `margin_on_single` and `border_on_single` to Bsp layout
  * Fix `Systray` crash on `reconfigure_screens`.
  * Fix bug where widgets can't be mirrored in same bar.
  * Fix various issues with setting fullscreen windows floating
    and vice versa.
  * Fix a bug where a .when() check for lazy functions errors out
    when matching on focused windows when none is focused. By default
    we do not match on focused windows, to change this set
    `if_no_focused` to True.
  * Widget with duplicate names will be automatically renamed by 
    appending numeric suffixes
  * Fix resizing of wallpaper when screen scale changes (X11)
  * Two small bugfixes for `StatusNotifier` - better handling of
    Ayatana indicators
  * Fix bug where StatusNotifierItem crashes due to invalid object
    paths (e.g. Zoom)
- from v0.20.0 
  * Add place_right option in the TreeTab layout to place the tab
    panel on the right side
  * X11: Add support for _NET_DESKTOP_VIEWPORT. E.g. can be used by
    rofi to map on current output.
  * Wayland: Bump wlroots version. 0.15.x wlroots and 0.15.2+
    pywlroots are required.
  * Add XWayland support to the Wayland backend. XWayland will 
    start up as needed, if it is installed.
  * Remove non-commandable windows from IPC. Fixes bug where IPC
    would fail when trying to get in on all windows but Systray 
    has icons (which are non-commandable _Windows.)
  * Fix bug where bars were not reconfigured correctly when screen
    layout changes.
  * Fix a Wayland bug where layer-shell surface like dunst would
    freeze up and stop updating.
  * Change timing of screens_reconfigured hook. Will now be called
    ONLY if cmd_reconfigure_screens has been called and completed.
  * Fix order of icons in Systray widget when restarting/reloading
    config.
  * Fix rounding error in PulseVolume widget's reported volume.
- from v0.19.0
  * Add ability to draw borders to the Bar. Can customise size and
    colour per edge.
  * Add StatusNotifier widget implementing the StatusNotifierItem 
    specification. NB Widget does not provide context menus.
  * Add total bandwidth format value to the Net widget.
  * Scratchpad groups could be defined as single so that only one of
    the scratchpad in the group is visible at a given time.
  * All scratchpads in a Scratchpad group can be hidden with
    hide_all() function.
  * For saving states of scratchpads during restart, we use wids
    instead of pids.
  * Scratchpads can now be defined with an optional matcher to
    match with window properties.
  * Qtile.cmd_reload_config is added for reloading the config
    without completely restarting.
  * Window.cmd_togroup's argument groupName should be changed
    to group_name. For the time being a log warning is in place
    and a migration is added. In the future groupName will fail.
  * Add min/max_ratio to Tile layout and fix bug where windows
    can extend offscreen.
  * Add ability for widget mouse_callbacks to take lazy calls
    (similar to keybindings)
  * Add aliases to lazy.spawncmd() which takes a dictionary
    mapping convenient aliases to full command lines.
  * Add a new 'prefix' option to the net widget to display speeds
    with a static unit (e.g. MB).
  * lazy.group.toscreen() now does not toggle groups by default.
    To get this behaviour back, use lazy.group.toscreen(toggle=True)
  * Tile layout has new margin_on_single and border_on_single option
    to specify whether to draw margin and border when there is only one window.
  * Thermal zone widget.
  * Allow TextBox-based widgets to display in vertical bars.
  * Added a focused attribute to lazy.function.when which can be
    used to Match on focused windows.
  * Allow to update Image widget with update() function by giving a new path.

- Do only pull in default python3 providers: this package does not
  provide any python module, so there is no reason in pulling all
  python flavors into the buildroot.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 22 14:37:51 UTC 2021 - Dawid Respondek <nyslay@gmail.com>
- Update to version 0.18.1:
  * features
      - All layouts will accept a list of colors for border_* options with which
        they will draw multiple borders on the appropriate windows.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 06 12:09:51 UTC 2021 - Dawid Respondek <nyslay@gmail.com>

- Update to version 0.18.0:
  * Config breakage
        - The `qtile` entry point doesn't run `qtile start` by default anymore
        - New optional dependency for dbus related features: dbus-next.
          Replaces previous reliance on dbus/Glib and allows qtile to use async
          dbus calls within asyncio's eventloop.
        - widget.BatteryIcon no longer has a fallback text mode; use
          widget.Battery instead
        - MonadX layout key new_at_current is deprecated, use new_client_position.
        - `libqtile.window` has been moved to `libqtile.backend.x11.window`; a migration has been added for this.
  * deprecation warning
        - 'main' config functions, deprecated in 0.16.1, will no longer be executed.
  * Notice for packagers - new dependencies
        - Tests now require the 'dbus-next' python module plus 'dbus-launch' and 'notify-send' applications
  * features
      - added transparency in x11 and wayland backends
      - added measure_mem and measure_swap attributes to memory widget to allow user to choose measurement units.
      - memory widget can now be displayed with decimal values
      - new "qtile migrate" command, which will attempt to upgrade previous
        configs to the current version in the case of qtile API breaks.
      - A new `reconfigure_screens` config setting. When `True` (default) it
        hooks `Qtile.reconfigure_screens` to the `screen_change` hook,
        reconfiguring qtile's screens in response to randr events. This
        removes the need to restart qtile when adding/removing external
        monitors.
      - improved key chord / sequence functionality. Leaving a chord with `mode`
        set brings you to a named mode you activated before, see #2264.
        A new command, `lazy.ungrab_all_chords`, was introduced to return to the root bindings.
        The `enter_chord` hook is now always called with a string argument.
        The third argument to `KeyChord` was renamed from `submaping` to `submapping` (typo fix).
      - added new argument for CheckUpdates widget: `custom_command_modify` which allows user to modify the
        the line count of the output of `custom_command` with a lambda function (i.e. `lambda x: x-3`).
        Argument defaults to `lambda x: x` and is overridden by `distro` argument's internal lambda.
      - added new argument for the WindowName, WindowTabs and Tasklist widgets: `parse_text` which allows users to
        define a function that takes a window name as an input, modify it in some way (e.g. str.replace(), str.upper() or regex)
        and show that modification on screen.
      - A Wayland backend has been added which can be used by calling `qtile start -b wayland` directly in your TTY.
        It requires the latest releases of wlroots, python-xkbcommon, pywayland and pywlroots. It is expected to be
        unstable so please let us know if you find any bugs!
      - The 'focus` argument to `Click` and `Drag` objects in your config are no longer necessary (and are ignored).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 27 08:45:51 UTC 2021 - Petr Cervinka <petr@cervinka.net>

- Update to version 0.17.0:
  * Python 3.5 and 3.6 are no longer supported
  * Config breakage:
    - Pacman widget has been removed. Use CheckUpdates instead.
    - Mpris widget has been removed. Use Mpris2 instead.
    - property "masterWindows" of Tile layout renamed to master_length
    - Match objects now only allow one string argument for their wm
      name/class/etc. properties. to update your config, do e.g.
               Group('www', spawn='firefox', layout='xmonad',
          -          matches=[Match(wm_class=['Firefox', 'google-chrome', 'Google-chrome'])]),
          +          matches=[Match(wm_class='Firefox'), Match(wm_class='google-chrome'), Match(wm_class='Google-chrome')]),
     - properties wname, wmclass and role of Slice-layout replaced by Match-
       type property "match"
     - rules specified in `layout.Floating`'s `float_rules` are now evaluated with
       AND-semantics instead of OR-semantics, i.e. if you specify 2 different
       property rules, both have to match
    - check the new `float_rules` for `floating_layout` in the default config and
      extend your own rules appropriately: some non-configurable auto-floating rules
      were made explicit and added to the default config
    - using `dict`s for `layout.Floating`'s `float_rules` is now deprecated, please
      use `config.Match` objects instead
    - `no_reposition_match` in `layout.Floating` has been removed; use the list of
      `config.Match`-objects `no_reposition_rules` instead
    - Command line has been modernized to a single entry point, the `qtile`
      binary. Translations are below:
            qtile     -> qtile start
            qtile-cmd -> qtile cmd-obj
            qtile-run -> qtile run-cmd
            qtile-top -> qtile top
            qshell    -> qtile shell
      iqshell and dqtile-cmd are no longer distributed with the
      package, as they were either user or developer scripts. Both are
      still available in the qtile repo in /scripts.
    - Running `qtile` without arguments will continue to work for the
      forseeable future, but will be eventually deprecated. qtile prints a
      warning when run in this configuration.
    - Qtile.cmd_focus_by_click is no longer an available command.
    - Qtile.cmd_get_info is no longer an available command.
    - libqtile.command_* has been deprecated, it has been moved to
      libqtile.command.*
    - libqtile.widget.base.ThreadedPollText has been removed; out of tree
      widgets can use ThreadPoolText in the same package instead.
    - the YahooWeather widget was removed since Yahoo retired their free
      tier of the weather API
    - Deprecated hook `window_name_change` got removed, use
      `client_name_updated` instead.
    - show_state attribute from WindowName widget has been removed. Use format attribute instead.
            show_state = True  -> format = '{state}{name}'
            show_state = False -> format = '{name}'
    - mouse_callbacks no longer receives the qtile object as an argument
      (they receive no arguments); import it via `from libqtile import
      qtile` instead.
  * Features
    - new WidgetBox widget
    - new restart and shutdown hooks
    - rules specified in `layout.Floating`'s `float_rules` are now evaluated with
      AND-semantics, allowing for more complex and specific rules
    - Python 3.9 support
    - switch to Github Actions for CI
    - Columns layout has new `margin_on_single` option to specify margin
      size when there is only one window (default -1: use `margin` option).
    - new OpenWeather widget to replace YahooWeather
    - new format attribute for WindowName widget
    - new max_chars attribute for WindowName widget
    - libqtile now exports type information
    - add a new `qtile check` subcommand, which will check qtile configs
      for various things:
          - validates configs against the newly exported type information
            if mypy is present in the environment
          - validates that qtile can import the config file (e.g. that
            syntax is correct, ends in a .py extension, etc.)
          - validates Key and Mouse mod/keysym arguments are ok.
    - Columns layout now enables column swapping by using swap_column_left and swap_column_right
  * Warning
    When (re)starting, Qtile passes its state to the new process in a
    file now, where previously it passed state directly as a string. This
    fixes a bug where some character encodings (i.e. in group names) were
    getting messed up in the conversion to/from said string. This change
    will cause issues if you update Qtile then restart it, causing the
    running old version to pass state in the previous format to the new
    process which recognises the new.
- Update qtile-rpmlintrc, remove warning related to dqtile-cmd, ignore zero-length for py.typed
- Remove shebang in cmd_obj.py 
- Add typelib(Notify) to test requirements
- Remove man pages (dropped in upstream)
- Add sensors to recommends
- Disable tests test_qtile_cmd (unstable in obs, works fine in local build osc environment)

- Fix Source

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 26 13:37:18 UTC 2020 - John Vandenberg <jayvdb@gmail.com>

- Remove unnecessary development build dependencies
- Re-enable test suite
- Update to v0.16.1
  * Hooks 'addgroup', 'delgroup' and 'screen_change' will no
    longer receive the qtile object as an argument. It can be
    accessed directly at libqtile.qtile
  * defining a main function in your config is deprecated. Use
    @hook.subscribe.startup_complete instead. If you need access
    to the qtile object, import it from libqtile directly
  * include tests in the release for distros to consume
  * don't resize 0th screen incorrectly on root ConfigureNotify
  * expose qtile object as libqtile.qtile (note that we still
    consider anything not prefixed with cmd_ to be a private API)
  * fix transparent borders
  * MonadTall, MonadWide, and TreeTab now work with Slice
- from v0.16.0
  * Imports from libqtile.widget are now made through a function
    proxy to avoid the side effects of importing all widgets at
    once. If you subclass a widget in your config, import it from
    its own module
    e.g. from libqtile.widget.pomodoro import Pomodoro
  * added `guess_terminal` in utils
  * added keybinding cheet sheet image generator
  * custom keyboardlayout display
  * added native support for key chords
  * validate config before restart and refuse to restart with
    a bad config
  * added a bunch of type annotations to config objects
  * Fixed a bug where the lazy.restart() binding would crash Qtile
  * major focus rework; Java-based IDEs such as PyCharm,
    NetBrains, etc. now focus correctly
  * fix a bug where spotify (or any window with focus-to=parent)
    was closed, nothing would be focused and no hotkeys would work
  * support windows unsetting the input hint
  * respects window's/user's location setting if present (WM_SIZE_HINTS)
  * fixed YahooWeather widget for new API
  * fix a bug where _NET_WM_DESKTOPS wasn't correctly updated when
    switching screens in some cases
  * fix a crash in the BSP layout
  * fix a stacktrace when unknown keysyms are encounted
  * make qtile --version output more sane
  * fix a rendering issue with special characters in window names

- Increase required cairocffi version

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun 24 12:03:05 UTC 2019 - petr@cervinka.net

- Update to version 0.14.2:
  * Bugfixes
    - previous release still exhibited same issues with package data,
      really fix it this time
- Update to version 0.14.1:
    * Bugfixes
      - properly include png files in the package data to install included icons
- Update to version 0.14.0:
  * Config breakage
    - Many internal things were renamed from camel case to snake case. If
      your config uses main(), or any lazy.function() invocations that
      interact directly with the qtile object, you may need to forward port
      them. Also note that we do *not* consider the qtile object to be a
      stable api, so you will need to continue forward porting these things
      for future refactorings (for wayland, etc.). A better approach may be
      to add an upstream API for what you want to do ;)
    - Maildir's subFolder and maildirPath changed to maildir_path and sub_folder.
    * Features
        - add custom `change_command` to backlight widget
        - add CommandSet extension to list available commands
        - simplify battery monitoring widget interface and add freebsd
          compatible battery widget implementation
        - track last known mouse coordinates on the qtile manager
        - allow configuration of warping behavior in columns layout
    * Bugfixes
        - with cursor warp enabled, the cursor is warped on screen change
        - fix stepping groups to skip the scratch pad group
        - fix stack layout to properly shuffle
        - silence errors when unmapping windows
