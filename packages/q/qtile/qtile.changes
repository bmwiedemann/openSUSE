-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun May 26 00:11:29 UTC 2024 - Soc Virnyl Estela <uncomfy+openbuildservice@uncomfyhalomacro.pl>

- Update to version 0.26.0
  - this release drops support for python 3.9
  - deleted the (very old) libqtile/command_* deprecation wrappers
  - SIGUSR2 no longer restarts qtile, instead it dumps stack traces
  - lazy.<object>.when(when_floating=X) now behaves differently: the lazy call will be executed
    independently of the current window's float state by default, and can be limited to when it
    is floating or tiled by passing when_floating as True or False respectively.
  - Dropped support for KDE idle protocol on Wayland
  - Qtile's Wayland backend now requires wlroots 0.17.x, pywlroots 0.17.x and pywayland >= 0.4.17.
  - We currently do not build for pypy-3.10 as there seems to be a resolution error in either pypy or pip (https://github.com/pypy/pypy/issues/4956)
  - For Wayland you can now set the cursor theme and size to forcefully use in Qtile,
    set `wl_xcursor_theme` and `wl_xcursor_size` in the configuration
  - automatically lift types to their annotated type when specified via
    the `qtile cmd-obj` command line
  - Add `Plasma` layout. The original layout (https://github.com/numirias/qtile-plasma) appears to be unmaintained
    so we have added this to the main codebase.
  - Add ability to specify muted and unmuted formats for `Volume` and `PulseVolume` widgets.
  - Add back server-side opacity support for Wayland backend
- Attempt to use tests without xvfb

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May 21 14:36:38 UTC 2024 - Soc Virnyl Estela <uncomfy+openbuildservice@uncomfyhalomacro.pl>

- Update to version 0.25.0:
  * features
    - The Battery widget now supports dynamic charge control, allowing for
      protecting battery life.
    - To support the above (plus the other widgets that modify sysfs), qtile
      now ships with its own udev rules, located at
      /resources/99-qtile.rules; distro packagers will probably want to
      install this rule set.
  * bugfixes
    - Fix groups marked with `persist=False` not being deleted when their last window is moved to another group.
    - Fallback icon in StatusNotifier widget

- Update to version 0.24.0
    !!! config breakage/changes !!!
      - Matches no longer use "include/substring" style matching. But match the string
      exactly. Previously on X11, if the WM_TYPE of a spawned window is e.g. dialog a
      match with wm_type dialognoonereadschangelogs would return true. Additionally
      a window with an empty WM_CLASS (which can happen) would match anything. If
      you rely this style of substring matching, pass a regex to your match or use
      a function with func=.
        Using a list of strings inside Match with role, title, wm_class,
        wm_instance_class, wm_type are also deprecated, use a regex. Right now we
        replace the property with a regex if it's a list and warn with a deprecation
        message. You can use "qtile migrate" to migrate your config to this.
    * features
      - Change how `tox` runs tests. See
      https://docs.qtile.org/en/latest/manual/contributing.html#running-tests-locally
      for more information on how to run tests locally.
      - Add `ScreenSplit` layout which allows multiple layouts per screen. Also adds `ScreenSplit`
        widget to display name of active split.
      - Updated `Bluetooth` widget which allows users to manage multiple devices in a single widget
      - Add `align` option to `Columns` layout so new windows can be added to left or right column.
      - `.when()` have two new parameters:
        - `func: Callable`: Enable call when the result of the callable evaluates to True
        - `condition: bool`: a boolean value to determine whether the lazy object should be run. Unlike `func`, the
          condition is evaluated once when the config file is first loaded.
      - Add ability to have bar drawns over windows by adding `reserve=False` to bar's config to
        stop the bar reserving screen space.
      - Add ability for third-party code (widgets, layouts) to create hooks
      - Add ability to create user-defined hooks which can be fired from external scripts
    * bugfixes
      - Fix two bugs in stacking transient windows in X11
      - Checking configs containing `qtile.core.name` with `python config.py` don't fail anymore (but `qtile.core.name`
        will be `None`)
      - Fix an error if a wayland xwindow has unknown wm_type

Tue Oct  3 14:19:28 UTC 2023 - Soc Virnyl Estela <uncomfy+openbuildservice@uncomfyhalomacro.pl>

- Reenable tests in specfile.
- Update to version 0.23.0
    !!! Dependency Changes !!!
      - xcffib must be upgraded to >= 1.4.0
      - cairocffi must be upgraded to >= 1.6.0
      - New optional dependency `pulsectl-asyncio` required for `PulseVolume` widget
    !!! Notice for packagers - wlroots (optional dependency) bump !!!
      - Qtile's wayland backend now requires on wlroots 0.16 (and pywlroots 0.16)
    !!! config breakage/changes !!!
      - The `cmd_` prefix has been dropped from all commands (this means command names are common when accessed
        via the command interface or internal python objects).
      - Custom widgets should now expose command methods with the `@expose_command` decorator (available via
        `from libqtile.command.base import expose_command`).
      - Some commands have been renamed (in addition to dropping the 'cmd_' prefix):
          `hints` -> `get_hints`
          `groups` -> `get_groups`
          `screens` -> `get_screens`
      - Layouts need to rename some methods:
        - `add` to `add_client`
        - `cmd_next` to `next`
        - `cmd_previous` to `previous`
      - Layouts or widgets that redefine the `commands` property need to update the signature:
          `@expose_command()`
          `def commands(self) -> list[str]:`
      - `Window.getsize` has been renamed `Window.get_size` (i.e. merged with the get_size command).
      - `Window.getposition` has been renamed `Window.get_position` (i.e. merged with the get_position command).
      - The `StockTicker` widget `function` option is being deprecated: rename it to `func`.
      - The formatting of `NetWidget` has changed, if you use the `format` parameter in your config include 
        `up_suffix`, `total_suffix` and `down_suffix` to display the respective units.
      - The `Notify` widget now has separate `default_timeout` properties for differenct urgency levels. Previously,
        `default_timeout` was `None` which meant that there was no timeout for all notifications (unless this had been
        set by the client sending the notification). Now, `default_timeout` is for normal urgency notifications and this
        has been set to a default of 10 seconds. `default_timeout_urgent`, for critical notifications, has a timeout of `None`.
      - The `PulseVolume` widget now depends on a third party library, `pulsectl-asyncio`, to interact with the pulse audio
        server. Users will now see an `ImportError` until they install that library.
    * features
        - Add ability to set icon size in `LaunchBar` widget.
        - Add 'warp_pointer' option to `Drag` that when set will warp the pointer to the bottom right of
          the window when dragging begins.
        - Add `currentsong` status to `Mpd2` widget.
        - Add ability to disable group toggling in `GroupBox` widget
        - Add ability to have different border color when windows are stacked in Stack layout. Requires 
          setting `border_focus_stack` and `border_normal_stack` variables.
        - Add ability to have different single border width for Columns layout by setting 'single_border_width' key.
        - Add ability to have different border and margin widths when VerticalTile layout only contains 1 window by
          setting 'single_border_width' and 'single_margin' keys.
        - New widget: GenPollCommand
        - Add `format` and `play_icon` parameters for styling cmus widget.
        - Add ability to add a group at a specified index
        - Add ability to spawn the `WidgetBox` widget opened.
        - Add ability to swap focused window based on index, and change the order of windows inside current group
        - Add ability to update the widget only once if `update_interval` is None.
        - Add `move_to_slice` command to move current window to single layout in `Slice` layout
        - Made the `NetWidget` text formattable.
        - Qtile no longer floods the log following X server disconnection, instead handling those errors.
        - `Key` and `KeyChord` bindings now have another argument `swallow`.
          It indicates whether or not the pressed keys should be passed on to the focused client.
          By default the keys are not passed (swallowed), so this argument is set to `True`.
          When set to `False`, the keys are passed to the focused client. A key is never swallowed if the
          function is not executed, e.g. due to failing the `.when()` check.
        - Add ability to set custom "Undefined" status key value to `Mpd2Widget`.
        - `Mpd2Widget` now searches for artist name in all similar keys (i.e `albumartist`, `performer`, etc.).
        - Add svg support to `CustomLayoutIcon`
        - added layering controls for X11 (Wayland support coming soon!):
          - `lazy.window.keep_above()/keep_below()` marks windows to be kept above/below other windows permanently.
             Calling the functions with no arguments toggles the state, otherwise pass `enable=True` or `enable=False`.
          - `lazy.window.move_up()/move_down()` moves windows up and down the z axis.
          - added `only_focused` setting to Max layout, allowing to draw multiple clients on top of each other when
            set to False
        - Add `suspend` hook to run functions before system goes to sleep.
    * bugfixes
        - Fix bug where Window.center() centers window on the wrong screen when using multiple monitors.
        - Fix `Notify` bug when apps close notifications.
        - Fix `CPU` precision bug with specific version of `psutil`
        - Fix config being reevaluated twice during reload (e.g. all hooks from config were doubled)
        - Fix `PulseVolume` high CPU usage when update_interval set to 0.
        - Fix `Battery` widget on FreeBSD without explicit `battery` index given.
        - Fix XMonad layout faulty call to nonexistent _shrink_up
        - Fix setting tiled position by mouse for layouts using _SimpleLayoutBase. To support this in other layouts, add a swap method taking two windows.
        - Fix unfullscreening bug in conjunction with Chromium based clients when auto_fullscreen is set to `False`.
        - Ensure `CurrentLayoutIcon` expands paths for custom folders.
        - Fix vertical alignment of icons in `TaskList` widget
        - Fix laggy resize/positioning of floating windows in X11 by handling motion notify events later. We also introduced a cap setting if you want to limit these events further, e.g. for limiting resource usage. This is configurable with the x11_drag_polling_rate variable for each `Screen` which is set to None by default, indicating no cap.
    * python version support
        - We have added support for python 3.11 and pypy 3.9.
        - python 3.7, 3.8 and pypy 3.7 are not longer supported.
        - Fix bug where `StatusNotifier` does not update icons

- Update to v0.22.1
  * GitHub tag is signed for those who need it
- from v0.22.0
  * !!! Config breakage !!! lazy.qtile.display_kb() no longer
    receives any arguments. If you passed it any arguments
    (which were ignored previously), remove them.
  * If you have a custom startup Python script that you use instead
    of `qtile start` and run init_log manually, the signature has
    changed. Please check the source for the updated arguments.
  * `KeyChord`'s signature has changed. ``mode`` is now a boolean
    to indicate whether the mode should persist.
    The ``name`` parameter should be used to name the chord
    (e.g. for the ``Chord`` widget).
  * Add ability to draw borders and add margins to the `Max` layout.
  * The default XWayland cursor is now set at startup to left_ptr,
    so an xsetroot call is not needed to avoid the ugly X cursor.
  * Wayland: primary clipboard should now behave same way as with
    X after selecting something it should be copied into clipboard
  * Add `resume` hook when computer resumes from sleep/suspend/hibernate.
  * Add `text_only` option for `LaunchBar` widget.
  * Add `force_update` command to `ThreadPoolText` widgets to simplify
    updating from key bindings
  * Add scrolling ability to `_TextBox`-based widgets.
  * Add player controls (via mouse callbacks) to `Mpris2` widget.
  * Wayland: input inhibitor protocol support added (pywayland>=0.4.14
    & pywlroots>=0.15.19)
  * Add commands to control Pomodoro widget.
  * Add icon theme support to `TaskList` widget (available on X11
    and Wayland backends).
  * Wayland: Use `qtile cmd-obj -o core -f get_inputs` to get
    input device identifiers for configuring inputs. Also input
    configs will be updated by config reloads (pywlroots>=0.15.21)
  * Widgets that are incompatible with a backend (e.g. Systray on
    Wayland) will no longer show as a ConfigError in the bar. Instead
    the widget is silently removed from the bar and a message
    included in the logs.
  * Reduce error messages in `StatusNotifier` widget from certain apps.
  * Reset colours in `Chord` widget
  * Prevent crash in `LaunchBar` when using SVG icons
  * Improve scrolling in `Mpris2` widget (options to repeat scrolling etc.)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Aug 21 23:44:05 UTC 2022 - John Vandenberg <jayvdb@gmail.com>

  * Fix various issues with setting fullscreen windows floating
    and vice versa.
  * Fix a bug where a .when() check for lazy functions errors out
    when matching on focused windows when none is focused. By default
    we do not match on focused windows, to change this set
    `if_no_focused` to True.
  * Widget with duplicate names will be automatically renamed by 
    appending numeric suffixes
  * Fix resizing of wallpaper when screen scale changes (X11)
  * Two small bugfixes for `StatusNotifier` - better handling of
    Ayatana indicators

    paths (e.g. Zoom)
- from v0.20.0 
  * Add place_right option in the TreeTab layout to place the tab
    panel on the right side
  * X11: Add support for _NET_DESKTOP_VIEWPORT. E.g. can be used by
    rofi to map on current output.
  * Wayland: Bump wlroots version. 0.15.x wlroots and 0.15.2+
    pywlroots are required.
  * Add XWayland support to the Wayland backend. XWayland will 
    start up as needed, if it is installed.
  * Remove non-commandable windows from IPC. Fixes bug where IPC
    would fail when trying to get in on all windows but Systray 
    has icons (which are non-commandable _Windows.)
  * Fix bug where bars were not reconfigured correctly when screen
    layout changes.
  * Fix a Wayland bug where layer-shell surface like dunst would
    freeze up and stop updating.
  * Change timing of screens_reconfigured hook. Will now be called
    ONLY if cmd_reconfigure_screens has been called and completed.
  * Fix order of icons in Systray widget when restarting/reloading
    config.
  * Fix rounding error in PulseVolume widget's reported volume.
- from v0.19.0
  * Add ability to draw borders to the Bar. Can customise size and
    colour per edge.
  * Add StatusNotifier widget implementing the StatusNotifierItem 
    specification. NB Widget does not provide context menus.
  * Add total bandwidth format value to the Net widget.
  * Scratchpad groups could be defined as single so that only one of
    the scratchpad in the group is visible at a given time.
  * All scratchpads in a Scratchpad group can be hidden with
    hide_all() function.
  * For saving states of scratchpads during restart, we use wids
    instead of pids.
  * Scratchpads can now be defined with an optional matcher to
    match with window properties.
  * Qtile.cmd_reload_config is added for reloading the config
    without completely restarting.
  * Window.cmd_togroup's argument groupName should be changed
    to group_name. For the time being a log warning is in place
    and a migration is added. In the future groupName will fail.

- Do only pull in default python3 providers: this package does not
  provide any python module, so there is no reason in pulling all
  python flavors into the buildroot.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 22 14:37:51 UTC 2021 - Dawid Respondek <nyslay@gmail.com>
- Update to version 0.18.1:
  * features
      - All layouts will accept a list of colors for border_* options with which
        they will draw multiple borders on the appropriate windows.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 06 12:09:51 UTC 2021 - Dawid Respondek <nyslay@gmail.com>

- Update to version 0.18.0:
  * Config breakage
        - The `qtile` entry point doesn't run `qtile start` by default anymore
        - New optional dependency for dbus related features: dbus-next.
          Replaces previous reliance on dbus/Glib and allows qtile to use async
          dbus calls within asyncio's eventloop.
        - widget.BatteryIcon no longer has a fallback text mode; use
          widget.Battery instead
        - MonadX layout key new_at_current is deprecated, use new_client_position.
        - `libqtile.window` has been moved to `libqtile.backend.x11.window`; a migration has been added for this.
  * deprecation warning
        - 'main' config functions, deprecated in 0.16.1, will no longer be executed.
  * Notice for packagers - new dependencies
        - Tests now require the 'dbus-next' python module plus 'dbus-launch' and 'notify-send' applications
  * features
      - added transparency in x11 and wayland backends
      - added measure_mem and measure_swap attributes to memory widget to allow user to choose measurement units.
      - memory widget can now be displayed with decimal values
      - new "qtile migrate" command, which will attempt to upgrade previous
        configs to the current version in the case of qtile API breaks.
      - A new `reconfigure_screens` config setting. When `True` (default) it
        hooks `Qtile.reconfigure_screens` to the `screen_change` hook,
        reconfiguring qtile's screens in response to randr events. This
        removes the need to restart qtile when adding/removing external
        monitors.
      - improved key chord / sequence functionality. Leaving a chord with `mode`
        set brings you to a named mode you activated before, see #2264.
        A new command, `lazy.ungrab_all_chords`, was introduced to return to the root bindings.
        The `enter_chord` hook is now always called with a string argument.
        The third argument to `KeyChord` was renamed from `submaping` to `submapping` (typo fix).
      - added new argument for CheckUpdates widget: `custom_command_modify` which allows user to modify the
        the line count of the output of `custom_command` with a lambda function (i.e. `lambda x: x-3`).
        Argument defaults to `lambda x: x` and is overridden by `distro` argument's internal lambda.
      - added new argument for the WindowName, WindowTabs and Tasklist widgets: `parse_text` which allows users to
        define a function that takes a window name as an input, modify it in some way (e.g. str.replace(), str.upper() or regex)
        and show that modification on screen.
      - A Wayland backend has been added which can be used by calling `qtile start -b wayland` directly in your TTY.
        It requires the latest releases of wlroots, python-xkbcommon, pywayland and pywlroots. It is expected to be
        unstable so please let us know if you find any bugs!
      - The 'focus` argument to `Click` and `Drag` objects in your config are no longer necessary (and are ignored).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 27 08:45:51 UTC 2021 - Petr Cervinka <petr@cervinka.net>

- Update to version 0.17.0:
  * Python 3.5 and 3.6 are no longer supported
  * Config breakage:
    - Pacman widget has been removed. Use CheckUpdates instead.
    - Mpris widget has been removed. Use Mpris2 instead.
    - property "masterWindows" of Tile layout renamed to master_length
    - Match objects now only allow one string argument for their wm
      name/class/etc. properties. to update your config, do e.g.
               Group('www', spawn='firefox', layout='xmonad',
          -          matches=[Match(wm_class=['Firefox', 'google-chrome', 'Google-chrome'])]),
          +          matches=[Match(wm_class='Firefox'), Match(wm_class='google-chrome'), Match(wm_class='Google-chrome')]),
     - properties wname, wmclass and role of Slice-layout replaced by Match-
       type property "match"
     - rules specified in `layout.Floating`'s `float_rules` are now evaluated with
       AND-semantics instead of OR-semantics, i.e. if you specify 2 different
       property rules, both have to match
    - check the new `float_rules` for `floating_layout` in the default config and
      extend your own rules appropriately: some non-configurable auto-floating rules
      were made explicit and added to the default config
    - using `dict`s for `layout.Floating`'s `float_rules` is now deprecated, please
      use `config.Match` objects instead
    - `no_reposition_match` in `layout.Floating` has been removed; use the list of
      `config.Match`-objects `no_reposition_rules` instead
    - Command line has been modernized to a single entry point, the `qtile`
      binary. Translations are below:
            qtile     -> qtile start
            qtile-cmd -> qtile cmd-obj
            qtile-run -> qtile run-cmd
            qtile-top -> qtile top
            qshell    -> qtile shell
      iqshell and dqtile-cmd are no longer distributed with the
      package, as they were either user or developer scripts. Both are
      still available in the qtile repo in /scripts.
    - Running `qtile` without arguments will continue to work for the
      forseeable future, but will be eventually deprecated. qtile prints a
      warning when run in this configuration.
    - Qtile.cmd_focus_by_click is no longer an available command.
    - Qtile.cmd_get_info is no longer an available command.
    - libqtile.command_* has been deprecated, it has been moved to
      libqtile.command.*
    - libqtile.widget.base.ThreadedPollText has been removed; out of tree
      widgets can use ThreadPoolText in the same package instead.
    - the YahooWeather widget was removed since Yahoo retired their free
      tier of the weather API
    - Deprecated hook `window_name_change` got removed, use
      `client_name_updated` instead.
    - show_state attribute from WindowName widget has been removed. Use format attribute instead.
            show_state = True  -> format = '{state}{name}'
            show_state = False -> format = '{name}'
    - mouse_callbacks no longer receives the qtile object as an argument
      (they receive no arguments); import it via `from libqtile import
      qtile` instead.
  * Features
    - new WidgetBox widget
    - new restart and shutdown hooks
    - rules specified in `layout.Floating`'s `float_rules` are now evaluated with
      AND-semantics, allowing for more complex and specific rules
    - Python 3.9 support
    - switch to Github Actions for CI
    - Columns layout has new `margin_on_single` option to specify margin
      size when there is only one window (default -1: use `margin` option).
    - new OpenWeather widget to replace YahooWeather
    - new format attribute for WindowName widget
    - new max_chars attribute for WindowName widget
    - libqtile now exports type information
    - add a new `qtile check` subcommand, which will check qtile configs
      for various things:
          - validates configs against the newly exported type information
            if mypy is present in the environment
          - validates that qtile can import the config file (e.g. that
            syntax is correct, ends in a .py extension, etc.)
          - validates Key and Mouse mod/keysym arguments are ok.
    - Columns layout now enables column swapping by using swap_column_left and swap_column_right
  * Warning
    When (re)starting, Qtile passes its state to the new process in a
    file now, where previously it passed state directly as a string. This
    fixes a bug where some character encodings (i.e. in group names) were
    getting messed up in the conversion to/from said string. This change
    will cause issues if you update Qtile then restart it, causing the
    running old version to pass state in the previous format to the new
    process which recognises the new.
- Update qtile-rpmlintrc, remove warning related to dqtile-cmd, ignore zero-length for py.typed
- Remove shebang in cmd_obj.py 
- Add typelib(Notify) to test requirements
- Remove man pages (dropped in upstream)
- Add sensors to recommends
- Disable tests test_qtile_cmd (unstable in obs, works fine in local build osc environment)

- Fix Source

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 26 13:37:18 UTC 2020 - John Vandenberg <jayvdb@gmail.com>

- Remove unnecessary development build dependencies
- Re-enable test suite
- Update to v0.16.1
  * Hooks 'addgroup', 'delgroup' and 'screen_change' will no
    longer receive the qtile object as an argument. It can be
    accessed directly at libqtile.qtile
  * defining a main function in your config is deprecated. Use
    @hook.subscribe.startup_complete instead. If you need access
    to the qtile object, import it from libqtile directly
  * include tests in the release for distros to consume
  * don't resize 0th screen incorrectly on root ConfigureNotify
  * expose qtile object as libqtile.qtile (note that we still
    consider anything not prefixed with cmd_ to be a private API)
  * fix transparent borders
  * MonadTall, MonadWide, and TreeTab now work with Slice
- from v0.16.0
  * Imports from libqtile.widget are now made through a function
    proxy to avoid the side effects of importing all widgets at
    once. If you subclass a widget in your config, import it from
    its own module
    e.g. from libqtile.widget.pomodoro import Pomodoro
  * added `guess_terminal` in utils
  * added keybinding cheet sheet image generator
  * custom keyboardlayout display
  * added native support for key chords
  * validate config before restart and refuse to restart with
    a bad config
  * added a bunch of type annotations to config objects
  * Fixed a bug where the lazy.restart() binding would crash Qtile
  * major focus rework; Java-based IDEs such as PyCharm,
    NetBrains, etc. now focus correctly
  * fix a bug where spotify (or any window with focus-to=parent)
    was closed, nothing would be focused and no hotkeys would work
  * support windows unsetting the input hint
  * respects window's/user's location setting if present (WM_SIZE_HINTS)
  * fixed YahooWeather widget for new API
  * fix a bug where _NET_WM_DESKTOPS wasn't correctly updated when
    switching screens in some cases
  * fix a crash in the BSP layout
  * fix a stacktrace when unknown keysyms are encounted
  * make qtile --version output more sane

- Increase required cairocffi version

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun 24 12:03:05 UTC 2019 - petr@cervinka.net

- Update to version 0.14.2:
  * Bugfixes
    - previous release still exhibited same issues with package data,
      really fix it this time
- Update to version 0.14.1:
    * Bugfixes
      - properly include png files in the package data to install included icons
- Update to version 0.14.0:
  * Config breakage
    - Many internal things were renamed from camel case to snake case. If
      your config uses main(), or any lazy.function() invocations that
      interact directly with the qtile object, you may need to forward port
      them. Also note that we do *not* consider the qtile object to be a
      stable api, so you will need to continue forward porting these things
      for future refactorings (for wayland, etc.). A better approach may be
      to add an upstream API for what you want to do ;)
    - Maildir's subFolder and maildirPath changed to maildir_path and sub_folder.
