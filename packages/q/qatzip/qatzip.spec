%description
QATzip is a user space library which builds on top of the Intel
QuickAssist Technology user space library, to provide extended
accelerated compression and decompression services by offloading the
actual compression and decompression request(s) to the Intel Chipset
Series. QATzip produces data using the standard gzip* format
(RFC1952) with extended headers. The data can be decompressed with a
compliant gzip* implementation. QATzip is designed to take full
advantage of the performance provided by Intel QuickAssist
Technology.
