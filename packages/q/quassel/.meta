  <title>Modern, cross-platform, distributed IRC client</title>
  <description>Quassel IRC is a modern, cross-platform, distributed IRC client, meaning that
one (or multiple) client(s) can attach to and detach from a central core --
much like the popular combination of screen and a text-based IRC client such
as WeeChat, but graphical. In addition to this uniqe feature, we aim to bring
a pleasurable, comfortable chatting experience to all major platforms (including
Linux®, Windows®, and MacOS X® as well as Qtopia-based cell phones and PDAs),
making communication with your peers not only convenient, but also ubiquitous
available.</description>
