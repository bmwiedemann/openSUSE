  <title>Quick Binary Diff for generating and applying binary patches</title>
  <description>Quick Binary Diff (qbdiff) is a tool for generating and applying binary
patches. It builds on the general ideas of bsdiff.

It is designed to be faster than bsdiff by taking advantage of multiple CPU
cores. It is also designed to produce generally smaller patch files, and
supports only LZMA compression as it performs well on sparse binary data.
Further it aims to be frugal on memory usage and provides integrity checking
using BLAKE2B.</description>
