%description
QBE is a compiler backend that aims to provide 70% of the
performance of industrial optimizing compilers in 10% of the code.
QBE fosters language innovation by offering a compact user-friendly
and performant backend.

The size limit constrains QBE to focus on the essential and
prevents embarking on a never-ending path of diminishing returns.
