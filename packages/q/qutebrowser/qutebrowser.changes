Thu Oct 17 22:57:12 UTC 2019 - Martin Herkt <9+suse@cirno.systems>

- Update to version 1.8.1
Added
  * New userscripts:
    + readability-js which uses Mozilla's node.js readability
      library.
    + qute-bitwarden which integrates the Bitwarden CLI.

Changed
  * The statusbar text for passthrough mode now shows all
    configured bindings to leave the mode, not only one.
  * When :config-source is used with a relative filename, the file
    is now searched in the config directory instead of the current
    working directory.
  * HTML5 inputs with date/time types now enter insert mode when
    selected.
  * dictcli.py now shows where dictionaries are installed to and
    complains when running it as root if doing so would result in
    a wrong installation path.
  * Changes to userscripts:
    + qute-pass: Don't run pass if only a username is requested.
    + qute-pass: Support private domains like myrouter.local.
    + readability: Improved CSS styling.
  * Performance improvements in various areas:
    + Loading config files
    + Typing without any completion matches
    + General keyboard handling
    + Scrolling
  * :version now shows details about the loaded
    autoconfig.yml/config.py.
  * Hosts are now additionally looked up including their ports in
    netrc files.
  * With Qt 5.10 or newer, qutebrowser now doesn't force software
    rendering with Nouveau drivers anymore. However,
    QtWebEngine/Chromium still do so.
  * The XSS Auditor is now disabled by default
    (content.xss_auditing = false). This reflects a similar change
    in Chromium, see their XSS Auditor Design Document for details.

Fixed
  * :config-write-py now correctly writes config.unbind(...) lines
    (instead of config.bind(..., None)) when unbinding a default
    keybinding.
  * Prevent repeat keyup events for JavaScript when a key is held
    down.
  * ~/.config/qutebrowser/blocked-hosts can now also contain
    /etc/hosts-like lines, not just simple hostnames.
  * Restored compatibility with Jinja2 2.8
  * Fixed implicit type conversion warning with Python 3.8.
  * The desktop file now sets StartupWMClass correctly, so the
    qutebrowser icon is no longer shown twice in the Gnome dock
    when pinned.
  * Bindings involving keys which need the AltGr key now work
    properly.
  * Fixed crash (caused by a Qt bug) when typing characters above
    the Unicode BMP (such as certain emoji or CJK characters).
  * dictcli.py now works properly again.
  * Shift can now be used while typing hint keystrings, which e.g.
    allows typing number hints on French keyboards.
  * With rapid hinting in number mode, backspace now edits the
    filter text after following a hint.
  * A certain type of error ("locking protocol") while initializing
    sqlite now isn't handled as crash anymore.
  * Crash when showing a permission request in certain scenarios.

Removed
  * At least Python 3.5.2 is now required to run qutebrowser,
    support for 3.5.0 and 3.5.1 was dropped.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul 18 15:27:22 UTC 2019 - Martin Herkt <9+suse@cirno.systems>

- Update to version 1.7.0
Added
  * New settings:
    + colors.tabs.pinned.* to control colors of pinned tabs.
    + hints.leave_on_load which allows disabling leaving of hint
      mode when a new page is loaded.
    + colors.completion.item.selected.match.fg which allows
      configuring the text color for the matching text in the
      currently selected completion item.
    + tabs.undo_stack_size to limit how many undo entries are kept
      for closed tabs.
  * New commands:
    + :reverse-selection (o in caret mode) to swap the
      stationary/moving ends of a selection.
  * New commandline replacements:
    + {url:domain}, {url:auth}, {url:scheme}, {url:username},
      {url:password}, {url:host}, {url:port}, {url:path},
      {url:query} for the respective parts of the current URL.
    + {title} for the current page title.
  * The {title} field in tabs.title.format,
    tabs.title.format_pinned and window.title_format got renamed to
    {current_title} (mirroring {current_url}) in order to not
    conflict with the new {title} commandline replacement.
  * New delete target for :hint which removes the hinted element
    from the DOM.
  * New --config-py commandline argument to use a custom config.py
    file.
  * Qt 5.13: Support for notifications (shown via system tray).

Changed
  * The desktop file qutebrowser.desktop is now renamed to
    org.qutebrowser.qutebrowser.desktop.
  * Pinned tabs now always show a favicon (even if the site doesn't
    provide one) when shrinking.
  * Setting downloads.location.directory now changes the directory
    displayed in the download prompt even if
    downloads.location.remember is set.
  * The yank command gained a new inline argument, which allows to
    e.g. use :yank inline [{title}]({url}).
  * Duplicate consecutive history entries with the same URL are now
    ignored.
  * More detailed error messages when spawning a process failed.
  * The content.pdfjs setting now supports domain patterns.
  * Improved process status output with :spawn -o.
  * The colors.tabs.bar.bg setting is now of type QssColor and thus
    supports gradients.
  * The :fullscreen command now understands a new --enter flag
    which causes it to always enter fullscreen instead of toggling
    the current state.
  * --debug-flag stack is now needed to show stack traces on
    renderer process crashes.
  * --debug-flag chromium can be used to easily turn on verbose
    Chromium logging.
  * Permission prompts can now be answered with
    Y (:prompt-accept --save yes) and N (:prompt-accept --save no)
    to save the answer as a per-domain setting.
  * content.dns_prefetch is now turned off by default, as it causes
    crashes inside QtWebEngine.
  * The (still unofficial) interceptor plugin API now contains
    resource_type for a request and allows redirecting requests.
  * :bookmark-remove now shows a message for consistency with
    :bookmark-add.
  * Very early segfaults are now also caught by the crash handler.
  * The appdata XML now contains proper release information and an
    (empty) OARS content rating.
  * Improved Linux distribution detection.
  * Qt 5.13: Request filtering now happens in the UI rather than
    IO thread.
  * Qt 5.13: Support for PDFium (Chromium's PDF viewer) is disabled
    for now so that PDFs can still be downloaded
    (or shown with PDF.js) properly.
  * Various performance improvements (e.g. for showing hints or
    the :open completion).

Deprecated
  * :yank markdown got deprecated, as :yank inline [{title}]({url})
    can now be used instead.

Fixed
  * Various QtWebEngine load signals are now handled differently,
    which should fix issues with insert mode being left while
    typing on sites like Google Translate.
  * Race condition causing a colored statusbar in normal mode when
    entering/exiting caret mode quickly.
  * Using 100% for a hue in a hsv(...) config value now corresponds
    to 359 (rather than 255), matching the fixed behavior in
    Qt 5.13.
  * Chaining commands with ;; used to abort with some failing
    commands. It now runs the second command no matter whether the
    first one succeeded or not.
  * Handling of profiles and private windows (and resulting crashes
    with Qt 5.12.2).
  * Fixes for corner-cases when using :navigate increment/decrement
  * The type for the colors.hints.match.fg setting was changed to
    QtColor.
  * Gradients were never supported for this setting, and with this
    change, values like rgb(0, 0, 0) now work as well.
  * Permission prompts now show a properly normalized URL with
    QtWebKit.
  * Crash on start when PyQt was built without SSL support with
    Qt >= 5.12.
  * Minor memory leaks.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun 18 12:13:45 UTC 2019 - Martin Herkt <9+suse@cirno.systems>

- Update to version 1.6.3
Fixed

  * Crash when hinting and changing/closing the tab before hints
    are displayed.
  * Crash on redirects with Qt 5.13.
  * Hide bogus AA_ShareOpenGLContexts warning with Qt 5.12.4.
  * Workaround for renderer process crashes with Qt 5.12.4.
    If you're unable to update, you can remove ~/.cache/qutebrowser
    for the same result.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May  6 21:15:52 UTC 2019 - Martin Herkt <9+suse@cirno.systems>

- Update to version 1.6.2
Fixed

  * Crash when SQL errors occur while using the completion.
  * Crash when cancelling a download prompt started in an already
    closed window.
  * Crash when many prompts are opened at the same time.
  * Running without Qt installed now displays a proper error again.
  * High CPU usage when using the keyhint widget with a low delay.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr  1 19:40:27 UTC 2019 - Martin Herkt <9+suse@cirno.systems>

- Force sqlite backend to be installed, otherwise qtbrowser segfaults
  bsc#1126269

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 20 06:05:39 UTC 2019 - Martin Herkt <9+suse@cirno.systems>

- Update to version 1.6.1
Fixed

  * Crash when using :config-{dict,list}-{add,remove} with an invalid setting.
  * Functionality like hinting on pages with an element with ID _qutebrowser
    (such as qutebrowser.org) on Qt 5.12.
  * The .desktop file in v1.6.0 was missing the "Actions" key.
  * The SVG icon now has a size of 256x256px set to comply with freedesktop
    standards.
  * Setting colors.statusbar.*.bg to a gradient now has the expected effect of
    the gradient spanning the entire statusbar.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb 26 01:48:56 UTC 2019 - Martin Herkt <9+suse@cirno.systems>

- Update to version 1.6.0
Added

  * New settings:
    + tabs.new_position.stacking which controls whether new tabs
      opened from a page should stack on each other or not.
    + completion.open_categories which allows to configure which
      categories are shown in the :open completion, and how they
      are ordered.
    + tabs.pinned.frozen to allow/deny navigating in pinned tabs.
    + hints.selectors which allows to configure what CSS selectors
      are used for hints, and also allows adding custom hint groups
    + input.insert_mode.leave_on_load to turn off leaving insert
      mode when a new page is loaded.

  * New config manipulation commands:
    + :config-dict-add and :config-list-add to a new element to a
      dict/list setting.
    + :config-dict-remove and :config-list-remove to remove an
      element from a dict/list setting.
    + New :yank markdown feature which yanks the current URL and
      title in markdown format.
    + Support for new QtWebEngine features in Qt 5.12:
      ~ Basic support for client certificates. Selecting the
        certificate to use when there are multiple matching
        certificates isn't implemented yet.
      ~ Support for DNS prefetching (plus new content.dns_prefetch
        setting).

Changed
  * :q now closes the current window instead of quitting
    qutebrowser completely (:close), while :qa quits (:quit).
    The behavior of :wq remains unchanged (:quit --save), as
    closing a window while saving the session doesn't make sense.
  * Completion highlighting is now done differently (using
    QSyntaxHighlighter), which should fix some highlighting
    corner-cases.
  * The QtColor config type now also understands colors like
    rgb(...).
  * :yank now has a --quiet option which causes it to not display
    a message.
  * The :open completion now also shows search engines by default.
  * The content.host_blocking.enabled setting now supports URL
    patterns, so the adblocker can be disabled on a given page.
  * Elements with a tabindex attribute now also get hints by
    default.
  * Various small performance improvements for hints and the
    completion.
  * The Wayland check for QtWebEngine is now disabled on
    Qt >= 5.11.2, as those versions should work without any issues.
  * The JavaScript console object is now available in PAC files.
  * PAC proxies currently don't work properly on QtWebEngine (and
    never did), so an error is now shown when trying to configure
    a PAC proxy.
  * The metainfo file qutebrowser.appdata.xml is now renamed to
    org.qutebrowser.qutebrowser.appdata.xml.
  * The qute-pass userscript now understands domains in gpg
    filenames in addition to directory names.
  * The autocompletion for content.headers.user_agent got updated
    to only include the default and Chrome, as setting the UA to
    Firefox has various bad side-effects.
  * Combining Qt 5.12 with an older PyQt can lead to issues, so a
    warning is now shown when starting qutebrowser with that
    combination.

Fixed
  * Invalid world IDs now get rejected for :jseval and GreaseMonkey
    scripts.
  * When websites suggest download filenames with invalid
    characters, those are now correctly replaced.
  * Invalid hint length calculation in certain rare cases.
  * Dragging tabs in the tab bar (which was broken in v1.5.0)
  * Using Shift-Home in command mode now works properly.
  * Workaround for a Qt bug which prevented
    content.cookies.accept = no-3rdparty from working properly on
    some pages like GMail. However, the default for
    content.cookies.accept is still all to be in line with what
    other browsers do.
  * :navigate not incrementing in anchors or queries.
  * Crash when trying to use a proxy requiring authentication with
    QtWebKit.
  * Slashes in search terms are now percent-escaped.
  * When scrolling.bar = True was set in versions before v1.5.0,
    this now correctly gets migrated to always instead of
    when-searching.
  * Completion highlighting now works again on Qt 5.11.3 and 5.12.1
  * The non-standard header X-Do-Not-Track is no longer sent.
  * PAC proxies were never correctly supported with QtWebEngine,
    but are now explicitly disallowed.
  * Issues with fullscreen handling when exiting a video player.
  * Various fixes for Qt 5.12 issues:
    + A javascript error on page load was fixed.
    + window.print() works with Qt 5.12 now.
    + Fixed handling of duplicate download filenames.
    + Fixed broken qute://history page.
    + Fixed PDF.js not working properly.
    + The download button in PDF.js now works (it's not possible
      to make it work with earlier Qt versions).
    + Since Greasemonkey scripts modifying the DOM fail when being
      run at document-start, some known-broken scripts (Iridium,
      userstyles.org) are now forced to run at document-end.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Feb 23 19:28:37 UTC 2019 - Martin Herkt <9+suse@cirno.systems>

- Require python3-qtwebengine-qt5 on TW
  (package split since PyQt5 5.12)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 29 22:23:40 UTC 2018 - Martin Herkt <9+suse@cirno.systems>

- Update to version 1.5.2:
  * The content.cookies.accept setting is now set to all instead
    of no-3rdparty by default, as no-3rdparty breaks various pages
    such as GMail.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct 10 17:50:18 UTC 2018 - Martin Herkt <9+suse@cirno.systems>

- Update to version 1.5.1:
  Fixed:
    * Flickering when opening/closing tabs (as soon as more than
      10 are open) on some pages.
    * Improved logging for PDF.js resources which fail to load.
    * Crash when closing a tab after doing a search.
    * Tabs appearing when hidden after e.g. closing tabs.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct  3 18:23:48 UTC 2018 - Martin Herkt <9+suse@cirno.systems>

- Update to version 1.5.0:
  Added:
    * Rewritten PDF.js support:
      + PDF.js support and the content.pdfjs setting are now
        available with QtWebEngine.
      + Opening a PDF file now doesn't start a second request
        anymore.
      + Opening PDFs on https:// sites now works properly.
      + New --pdfjs flag for prompt-open-download, so PDFs can be
        opened in PDF.js with <Ctrl-P> in the download prompt.
    * New settings:
      + content.mouse_lock to handle HTML5 pointer locking.
      + completion.web_history.exclude which hides a list of URL
        patterns from the completion.
      + qt.process_model which can be used to change Chromium's
        process model.
      + qt.low_end_device_mode which turns on Chromium's low-end
        device mode. This mode uses less RAM, but the expense of
        performance.
      + content.webrtc_ip_handling_policy, which allows more
        fine-grained/restrictive control about which IPs are
        exposed via WebRTC.
      + tabs.max_width which allows to have a more "normal" look
        for tabs.
      + content.mute which allows to mute pages (or all tabs) by
        default.
    * Running qutebrowser with QtWebKit or Qt < 5.9 now shows a
      warning (only once), as support for those is going to be
      removed in a future release.
    * New t[iI][hHu] default bindings (similar to tsh etc.) to
      toggle images.
    * The qute-pass userscript now has optional OTP support.
    * When :spawn --userscript is called with a count, that count
      is now passed to userscripts as $QUTE_COUNT.
  Changed:
    * Various performance improvements when many tabs are opened.
    * The content.headers.referer setting now works on QtWebEngine.
    * The :repeat command now takes a count which is multiplied
      with the given "times" argument.
    * The default keybinding to leave passthrough mode was changed
      from <Ctrl-V> to <Shift-Escape>, which makes pasting from the
      clipboard easier in passthrough mode and is also unlikely to
      conflict with webpage bindings.
    * The app_id is now set to qutebrowser for Wayland.
    * Using :set option now shows the value of the setting
      (like :set option? already did).
    * The completion.web_history_max_items setting got renamed to
      completion.web_history.max_items.
    * Regenerating completion history now shows a progress dialog.
    * The content.autoplay setting now supports URL patterns on
      Qt >= 5.11.
    * The content.host_blocking.whitelist setting now takes a list
      of URL patterns instead of globs.
    * In passthrough mode, Ctrl + Mousewheel now also gets passed
      through to the page instead of zooming.
    * Editing text in an external editor now simulates a JS "input"
      event, which improves compatibility with websites reacting
      via JS to input.
    * The qute://settings page is now properly sorted on Python 3.5
    * :zoom, :zoom-in and :zoom-out now have a --quiet switch which
      causes them to not display a message.
    * The scrolling.bar setting now takes three values instead of
      being a boolean: always, never, and when-searching (which
      only displays it while a search is active).
    * '@@' now repeats the last run macro.
    * The content.host_blocking.lists setting now accepts a file://
      URL to a directory, and reads all files in that directory.
    * The :tab-give and :tab-take command now have a new flag
      --keep which causes them to keep the old tab around.
    * :navigate now clears the URL query.
  Fixed:
    * qute:// pages now work properly on Qt 5.11.2
    * Error when passing a substring with spaces to :tab-take.
    * Greasemonkey scripts which start with an UTF-8 BOM are now
      handled correctly.
    * When no documentation has been generated, the plaintext
      documentation now can be shown for more files such as
      qute://help/userscripts.html.
    * Crash when doing initial run on Wayland without XWayland.
    * Crash when trying to load an empty session file.
    * :hint with an invalid --mode= value now shows a proper error.
    * Rare crash on Qt 5.11.2 when clicking on <select> elements.
    * Rare crash related to the completion.
  Removed:
    * Support for importing pre-v1.0.0 history files has been
      removed.
    * The content.webrtc_public_interfaces_only setting has been
      removed and replaced by content.webrtc_ip_handling_policy.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Sep  2 13:39:04 UTC 2018 - 9+suse@cirno.systems

- Update to version 1.4.2:
  Changed:
    * The content.xss_auditing setting is now enabled by default,
      to mirror Chromium's rather than Qt's default behavior.
    * Long URLs in the statusbar are now elided at the end rather
      than in the middle, to make sure the hostname is completely
      visible whenever possible.
  Fixed:
    * Crash in Qt 5.7.1 when a website uses window.print().
    * The workaround for Nouveau graphic drivers now works properly
      again.
    * Crash when using :follow-selected with a link which is
      outside of the view.
    * Workaround for windows not showing as urgent with some window
      managers (like i3).
    * Crash when opening URLs with some unicode characters
      (IDNA 2008). Those URLs still won't open though, due to
      missing support in Qt.
    * Crash when a download directory which can't be created is
      configured.
    * Crash in the importer.py script when importing Chrome
      bookmarks from newer Chrome versions.
    * The content.webrtc_public_interfaces_only option didn't work
      on Qt 5.11 previously (it now does). Note it still does not
      work on Qt 5.10 (due to a Qt bug) and Qt < 5.9.2.
    * Repeated escaping of entries in qute://log when refreshing
      page.
    * The host blocker doesn't block 0.0.0.0 anymore.
    * Crash when using :// as URL pattern.
    * The :buffer completion now sorts tabs with indices >= 10
      correctly again.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul 11 17:46:59 UTC 2018 - 9+suse@cirno.systems

- Update to version 1.4.1:
  Security:
    * CVE-2018-10895: Fix CSRF issue on the qute://settings page,
      leading to possible arbitrary code execution (boo#1100968).
      See the related GitHub issue for details:
      https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/issues/4060
  Fixed:
    * Rare crash when an error occurs in downloads.
    * Newlines are now stripped from the :version pastebin URL.
    * Worked around a Qt issue which redirects to a
      chrome-error:// page when trying to use U2F.
    * The link_pyqt.py script now works correctly with PyQt 5.11.

      avoid accidentally quitting the crash reporter when pressing
      escape.
    * New qute-lastpass userscript which uses the LastPass CLI to
      fill passwords.

        tabs.title.format which displays [M]/[A] for
        muted/recently audible tabs.
      + New :tab-mute command (bound to <Alt-m>) to mute/unmute a
        tab.
    * QtWebEngine: Support for content.cookies.accept with
      third-party cookies blocked by default (requires Qt 5.11).
    * QtWebEngine: New settings:
      + Support for requesting persistent storage via
        navigator.webkitPersistentStorage.requestQuota with a new
        content.persistent_storage setting (requires Qt 5.11).
        This setting also supports URL patterns.
      + Support for registering custom protocol handlers via
        navigator.registerProtocolHandler with a new
        content.register_protocol_handler setting (requires
        Qt 5.11). This setting also supports URL patterns.
      + Support for WebRTC screen sharing with a new
        content.desktop_capture setting (requires Qt 5.10).
        This setting also supports URL patterns.
      + New content.autoplay setting to enable/disable automatic
        video playback (requires Qt 5.10).
      + New content.webrtc_public_interfaces_only setting to only

    * New short flags for commandline arguments: -B and -T for
      --basedir and --temp-basedir; -d and -D for --debug and
      --debug-flag.
    * Deleting history items via :history-clear or
      :completion-item-del now also removes that URL from
      QtWebEngine's visited links.
    * There's now completion for commands taking a variable count
      of arguments (like :config-cycle).
    * QtWebEngine: On Qt 5.11.1, no reloads are needed anymore
      when switching between pages with changed settings
      (e.g. content.javascript.enabled).
    * The qt.force_software_rendering setting changed from a
      boolean to taking different values (software-opengl,
      qt-quick and chromium) for different kinds of software
      rendering workarounds.
    * On Qt 5.11, using wayland with QtWebEngine is now possible
      when using software rendering.
    * GreaseMonkey scripts now get their own global scope (based on
      the page's one), which allows scripts like OneeChan to work.
    * Rapid hinting is now supported with the yank and yank-primary
      targets, copying newline-separated links.
    * QtWebEngine: On Qt 5.11, the developer tools (inspector) can
      now be used securely and without requiring the
      --enable-webengine-inspector option.
    * The <Enter> key (:follow-selected) now follows the currently
      focused element if there's no selection.
    * The --logfilter argument now can be prepended with an
      exclamation mark (e.g. --logfilter '!init,destroy') to
      invert the filter.
    * :view-source now has a --pygments flag which uses the "old"
      way of rendering sources even with QtWebEngine.
    * Improved error messages when a setting needs a newer Qt
      version.
    * QtWebEngine: Various improvements to make the cursor more
      visible in caret browsing.
    * When a prompt is opened in insert/passthrough mode, the mode
      is restored after closing the prompt.
    * On Qt 5.10 or newer, dictionaries are now read from the
      qutebrowser data directory (e.g. ~/.local/share/qutebrowser)
      instead of /usr/share/qt.
      Existing dictionaries are copied over.
    * If an error while parsing ~/.netrc occurs, the cause of the
      error is now logged.
    * On Qt 5.9 or newer, certificate errors now show Chromium's
      detailed error page.
    * Greasemonkey scripts now support a "@qute-js-world" tag to
      run them in a different JavaScript context.
  Fixed:
    * Various subtle keyboard focus issues.
    * The security fix in v1.3.3 caused URLs with ampersands
      (www.example.com?one=1&two=2) to send the wrong arguments
      when clicked on the qute://history page (boo#1100968,
      CVE-2018-1000559).
    * Crash when opening a PDF page with PDF.js enabled
      (on QtWebKit), but no PDF.js installed.
    * Crash when closing a tab shortly after opening it.
  Removed:
    * :tab-detach which has been deprecated in v1.1.0 has been
      removed.
    * The content.developer_extras setting got removed.
      On QtWebKit, developer extras are now automatically enabled
      when opening the inspector.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun 22 10:25:18 UTC 2018 - 9+suse@cirno.systems

- Update to version 1.3.3:
  Security:
    * An XSS vulnerability on the qute://history page allowed
      websites to inject HTML into the page via a crafted title
      tag. This could allow them to steal your browsing history.
      If you're currently unable to upgrade, avoid using :history.
      This issue has been assigned CVE-2018-1000559.
  Fixed:
    * Crash in a workaround for a Qt 5.11 bug in rare
      circumstances.
    * Workaround for a Qt bug which preserves searches between page
      loads.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

  * QtWebEngine: Improved workaround for a bug in Qt 5.11 where
    only the top/bottom half of the window is used.
  * QtWebEngine: Work around a bug in Qt 5.11 where an endless
    loading-loop is triggered when clicking a link with an unknown
    scheme.
  * QtWebEngine: When switching between pages with changed
    settings, less unnecessary reloads are done now.
  * QtWebEngine: It's now possible to open external links such as
    magnet:// or mailto: via hints.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May 29 09:23:43 UTC 2018 - 9+suse@cirno.systems

- Update to version 1.3.1:
  * Work around a bug in Qt 5.11 where only the top/bottom half of
    the window is used. This workaround is incomplete, but fixes
    the majority of the cases where this happens.
  * Work around keyboard focus issues with Qt 5.11.
  * Work around an issue in Qt 5.11 where e.g. activating
    JavaScript per-domain needed a manual reload in some cases.
  * Don't crash when a ² key is pressed (e.g. on AZERTY keyboards).
  * Don't crash when a tab is opened and quickly closed again.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May  4 10:29:52 UTC 2018 - 9+suse@cirno.systems

- Use upstream Makefile to install

  Changed:
    * QtWebEngine: Support for JavaScript Shared Web Workers have
      been disabled on Qt versions older than 5.11 because of
      security issues in in Chromium. You can get the same effect
      in earlier versions via
      ":set qt.args ['disable-shared-workers']". An equivalent
      workaround is also contained in Qt 5.9.5 and 5.10.1.
    * The file dialog for downloads now has basic tab completion
      based on the entered text.
    * :version now shows OS information for POSIX OS other than
      Linux/macOS.
    * When there's an error inserting the text from an external
      editor, a backup file is now saved.
    * The window.hide_wayland_decoration setting got renamed to
      window.hide_decoration and now also works outside of wayland.
    * The tabs.favicons.show setting now can take three values:
      'always' (was True), 'never' (was False) and 'pinned'
      (to only show favicons for pinned tabs).
    * Hover tooltips on tabs now always show the webpage's title.
    * The default value for content.host_blocking.lists was
      changed to only include https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts
      which combines various sources.
    * Error messages when trying to wrap when tabs.wrap is False
      are now logged to debug instead of messages.

  Fixed:
    * Using hints before a page is fully loaded is now possible
      again.
    * Selecting hints with the number keypad now works again.
    * Tab titles for tabs loaded from sessions should now really be
      correct instead of showing the URL.
    * Loading URLs with customized settings from a session now
      avoids an additional reload.
    * The window icon and title now get set correctly again.
    * The tabs.switching_delay setting now has a correct maximum
      value limit set.
    * The taskadd script now works properly when there's multi-line
      output.
    * QtWebEngine: Worked around issues with
      GreaseMonkey/stylesheets not being loaded correctly in some
      situations.
    * The statusbar now more closely reflects the caret mode state.
    * The icon on Windows should now be displayed in a higher
      resolution.
    * The QtWebEngine development tools (inspector) now also work
      when JavaScript is disabled globally.
    * Building .exe files now works when upx is installed on the
      system.
    * The keyhint widget now shows the correct text for chained
      modifiers.
    * Loading GreaseMonkey scripts now also works with Jinja2 2.8
      (e.g. on Debian Stable).
    * Adding styles with GreaseMonkey on fast sites now works
      properly.
    * Window ID 0 is now excluded properly from ":tab-take"
      completion.
    * A rare crash when cancelling a download has been fixed.
    * The Makefile (intended for packagers) now supports PREFIX
      properly.
    * The workaround for a black window with Nvidia graphics is now
      enabled on non-Linux systems (like FreeBSD) as well.
    * Initial support for Qt 5.11.
    * Checking for a new version after sending a crash report now
      works properly again.
    * "@match" in Greasemonkey scripts now more closely matches the
      proper pattern syntax.
    * Searching via / or ? now doesn't handle any characters in a
      special way.
    * Fixed crash when trying to retry some failed downloads on
      QtWebEngine.
    * An invalid spellcheck dictionary filename now doesn't crash
      anymore. When no spellcheck dictionaries are configured,
      it's now disabled internally. This works around an issue with
      entering special characters on Facebook messenger.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 14 19:31:01 UTC 2018 - 9+suse@cirno.systems

- Update to version 1.2.1:
  Fixed:
    * qutebrowser now starts properly when the PyQt5
      QOpenGLFunctions package wasn't found.
    * The keybinding cheatsheet on the quickstart page is now
      loaded from a local qute:// URL again.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Mar 10 01:23:23 UTC 2018 - 9+suse@cirno.systems

- Update keyring
- Update to version 1.2.0:
  Added:
    * Initial implementation of per-domain settings:
      + :set and :config-cycle now have a -u/--pattern argument
        taking a URL match pattern for supported settings.
      + config.set in config.py now takes a third argument which is
        the pattern.
      + New with config.pattern('...') as p: context manager for
        config.py to use the shorthand syntax with a pattern.
      + New tsh keybinding to toggle scripts for the current host.
        With a capital S, the toggle is saved. With a capital H,
        subdomains are included. With u instead of h, the exact
        current URL is used.
      + New tph keybinding to toggle plugins, with the same
        additional binding described above.
    * New QtWebEngine features:
      + Caret/visual mode
      + Authentication via ~/.netrc
      + Retrying downloads with Qt 5.10 or newer
      + Hinting and other features inside same-origin frames
    * New flags for existing commands:
      + :session-load has a new --delete flag which deletes the
        session after loading it.
      + New --no-last flag for :tab-focus to not focus the last tab
        when focusing the currently focused one.
      + New --edit flag for :view-source to open the source in an
        external editor.
      + New --select flag for :follow-hint which acts like the
        given string was entered but doesn't necessary follow the
        hint.
    * New special pages:
      + qute://bindings (opened via :bind) which shows all
        keybindings.
      + qute://tabs (opened via :buffer) which lists all tabs.
    * New settings:
      + statusbar.widgets to configure which widgets should be
        shown in which order in the statusbar.
      + tabs.mode_on_change which replaces
        tabs.persist_mode_on_change. It can now be set to restore
        which remembers input modes (input/passthrough) per tab.
      + input.insert_mode.auto_enter which makes it possible to
        disable entering insert mode automatically when an editable
        element was clicked. Together with
        input.forward_unbound_keys, this should allow for
        emacs-like "modeless" keybindings.
    * New :prompt-yank command (bound to Alt-y by default) to yank
      URLs referenced in prompts.
    * The hostblock_blame script which was removed in v1.0 was
      updated for the new config and re-added.
    * New cycle-inputs.js script in scripts/ which can be used with
      :jseval -f to cycle through inputs.

  Changed:
    * Complete refactoring of key input handling, with various
      effects:
      + emacs-like keychains such as <Ctrl-X><Ctrl-C> can now be
        bound.
      + Key chains can now be bound in any mode (this allows
        binding unused keys in hint mode).
      + Yes/no prompts don't use keybindings from the prompt
        section anymore, they have their own yesno section instead.
      + Trying to bind invalid keys now shows an error.
      + The bindings.default setting can now only be set in a
        config.py, and existing values in autoconfig.yml are
        ignored.
    * Improvements for GreaseMonkey support:
      + @include and @exclude now support regex matches.
        With QtWebEngine and Qt 5.8 and newer, Qt handles the
        matching, but similar functionality will be added in
        Qt 5.11.
      + Support for @requires
      + Support for the GreaseMonkey 4.0 API
    * The sqlite history now uses write-ahead logging which should
      be a performance and stability improvement.
    * When an editor is spawned with :open-editor and :config-edit,
      the changes are now applied as soon as the file is saved in
      the editor.
    * The hist_importer.py script now only imports URL schemes
      qutebrowser can handle.
    * Deleting a prefix (:, / or ?) via backspace now leaves
      command mode.
    * Angular 1 elements and <summary>/<details> now get hints
      assigned.
    * :tab-only with pinned tabs now still closes unpinned tabs.
    * The url.incdec_segments option now also can take port as
      possible segment.
    * QtWebEngine: :view-source now uses Chromium's view-source:
      scheme.
    * Tabs now show their full title as tooltip.
    * When there are multiple unknown keys in a autoconfig.yml,
      they now all get reported in one error.
    * More performance improvements when opening/closing many tabs.
    * The :version page now has a button to pastebin the
      information.
    * Replacements like {url} can now be escaped as {{url}}.

  Fixed:
    * QtWebEngine bugfixes:
      + Improved fullscreen handling with Qt 5.10.
      + Hinting and scrolling now works properly on special
        view-source: pages.
      + Scroll positions are now restored correctly from sessions.
      + :follow-selected should now work in more cases with
        Qt > 5.10.
      + Incremental search now flickers less and doesn't move to
        the second result when pressing Enter.
      + Keys like Ctrl-V or Shift-Insert are now correctly
        handled/filtered with Qt 5.10.
      + Fixed hangs/segfaults on exit with Qt 5.10.1.
      + Fixed favicons sometimes getting cleared with Qt 5.10.
      + Qt download objects are now cleaned up properly when a
        download is removed.
      + JavaScript messages are now not double-HTML escaped anymore
        on Qt < 5.11
    * QtWebKit bugfixes:
      + Fixed GreaseMonkey-related crashes.
      + :view-source now displays a valid URL.
    * URLs containing ampersands and other special chars are now
      shown correctly when filtering them in the completion.
    * :bookmark-add "" foo can now be used to save the current URL
      with a custom title.
    * :spawn -o now waits until the process has finished before
      trying to show the output. Previously, it incorrectly showed
      the previous output immediately.
    * Suspended pages now should always load the correct page when
      being un-suspended.
    * Exception types are now shown properly with :config-source
      and :config-edit.
    * When using :bookmark-add --toggle, bookmarks are now saved
      properly.
    * Crash with an empty completion.timestamp_format.
    * Crash when completion.min_chars is set in some cases.
    * HTML/JS resource files are now read into RAM on start to
      avoid crashes when changing qutebrowser versions while it's
      open.
    * Setting bindings.key_mappings to an empty value is now
      allowed.
    * Bindings to an empty commands are now ignored rather than
      crashing.

  Removed:
    * QUTE_SELECTED_HTML is now not set for userscripts anymore
      except when called via hints.
    * The qutebrowser_viewsource userscript has been removed as
      :view-source --edit can now be used.
    * The tabs.persist_mode_on_change setting has been removed and
      replaced by tabs.mode_on_change.

      + tabs.pinned.shrink (true by default) to make it possible
        for pinned tabs and normal tabs to have the same size.
      + content.windowed_fullscreen to show e.g. a fullscreened
        video in the window without fullscreening that window.
      + tabs.persist_mode_on_change to keep the current mode when
        switching tabs.
      + session.lazy_restore which allows to not load pages
        immediately when restoring a session.
    * New commands:
      + :tab-give and :tab-take, to give tabs to another window,
        or take them from another window.
      + :completion-item-yank (bound to <Ctrl-C>) to yank the
        current completion item text.
      + :edit-command to edit the commandline in an editor.
      + search.incremental for incremental text search.

      + --private and --related flags for :edit-url, which have the
        same effect they have with :open.
      + --history for :completion-item-focus which causes it to go
        through the command history when no text was entered.
        The default bindings for cursor keys in the completion
        changed to use that, so that they can be used again to
        navigate through completion items when a text was entered.
      + --file for :debug-pyeval which makes it take a filename
        instead of a line of code.

    * The asciidoc2html.py script now uses Pygments (which is
      already a dependency of qutebrowser) instead of
      source-highlight for syntax highlighting.
    * The :buffer command now doesn't require quoting anymore,
      similar to :open.
    * The importer.py script was largely rewritten and now also
      supports importing from Firefox' places.sqlite file and
      Chrome/Chromium profiles.
    * Various internal refactorings to use Python 3.5 and
      ECMAscript 6 features.
    * If the window.hide_wayland_decoration setting is False, but
      QT_WAYLAND_DISABLE_WINDOWDECORATION is set in the
      environment, the decorations are still hidden.
    * The install_dict.py script for QtWebEngine was renamed to
      dictcli.py and can now also upgrade dictionaries correctly.
    * :undo now can re-open multiple tabs after :tab-only was used.
    * :config-write-py with a relative path now puts the file into
      the config directory.
    * The qute://version page now also shows the uptime of
      qutebrowser.
    * qutebrowser now prompts to create a non-existing directory
      when starting a download.

      filtering the completion.
    * The default font size for the UI got bumped up from 8pt to

      now matched in any order, and mixed matches on URL/tite are
      possible.
    * The system's default encoding (rather than UTF-8) is now used
      to decode subprocess output.
    * qutebrowser now ensures it's focused again after an external
      editor is closed.

Thu Oct 12 12:44:12 UTC 2017 - aloisio@gmx.com

- Update to version 1.0.0
  * Dependency changes:
    +  Support for legacy QtWebKit (before 5.212 which is
       distributed independently from Qt) is dropped.
    +  Support for Python 3.4 is dropped.
    +  Support for Qt before 5.7.1 and PyQt before 5.7 is dropped.
    +  New dependency on the QtSql module and Qt sqlite support.
    +  New dependency on the attrs project (packaged as
       python-attr in some distributions).
    +  The depedency on PyOpenGL (when using QtWebEngine) got
       removed. Note that PyQt5.QtOpenGL is still a dependency.
    +  PyQt5.QtOpenGL is now always required, even with QtWebKit.
  * The QtWebEngine backend is now used by default. Note this
    means that QtWebEngine now should be a required dependency, and
    QtWebKit (if new enough) should be changed to an optional
    dependency.
  * Completely rewritten configuration system which ignores the
    old config file. See link:qute://help/configuring.html[] for
    details.
  * Various documentation files got moved to the doc/ subfolder;
    qutebrowser.desktop got moved to misc/.
  * :set now doesn't support toggling/cycling values anymore, that
    functionality got moved to :config-cycle.
  * New completion engine based on sqlite, which allows to
    complete the entire browsing history. The default for
    completion.web_history_max_items got changed to -1 (unlimited).
    If the completion is too slow on your machine, try setting it to
    a few 1000 items.
  Added:
  * QtWebEngine: Spell checking support, see the
    spellcheck.languages setting.
  * New qt.args setting to pass additional arguments to
    Qt/Chromium.
  * New backend setting to select the backend to use. Together
    with the previous setting, this should make most wrapper
    scripts unnecessary.
  * qutebrowser can now be set as the default browser on macOS.
  * New config commands:
    + :config-cycle to cycle an option between multiple values.
    + :config-unset to remove a configured option.
    + :config-clear to remove all configured options.
    + :config-source to (re-)read a config.py file.
    + :config-edit to open the config.py file in an editor.
    + :config-write-py to write a config.py template file.
  * New :version command which opens qute://version.
  * New back/forward indicator in the statusbar.
  * New bindings.key_mappings setting to map keys to other keys.
  * QtWebEngine: Support for proxy authentication.
  Changed:
  * Using :download now uses the page's title as filename.
  * Using :back or :forward with a count now skips intermediate
    pages.
  * When there are multiple messages shown, the timeout is
    increased.
  * :search now only clears the search if one was displayed
    before, so pressing <Escape> doesn't un-focus inputs anymore.
  * Pinned tabs now adjust to their text's width, so the
    tabs.width.pinned setting got removed.
  * :set-cmd-text now has a --run-on-count argument to run the
    underlying command directly if a count was given.
  * :scroll-perc got renamed to :scroll-to-perc.
  Removed:
  * Migrating QtWebEngine data written by versions before
    2016-11-15 (before v0.9.0) is now not supported anymore.
  * Upgrading qutebrowser with a version older than v0.4.0 still
    running now won't work properly anymore.
  * The --harfbuzz and --relaxed-config commandline arguments got
    dropped.
  Fixes:
  * Exiting fullscreen via :fullscreen or buttons on a page now
    restores the correct previous window state
    (maximized/fullscreen).
  * When input.insert_mode.auto_load is set, background tabs now
    don't enter insert mode anymore.
  * The keybinding help widget now works correctly when using
    keybindings with a count.
  * The window.hide_wayland_decoration setting now works correctly
    again.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

  * Fixed:
    + Fixed crash with :download on PyQt 5.9.
    + Cloning a page without history doesn't crash anymore.
    + When a download results in a HTTP error, it now shows the error correctly
      instead of crashing.

    + (QtWebEngine) window.navigator.userAgent is now set correctly when
      customizing the user agent.
    + (QtWebEngine) HTML fullscreen is now tracked for each tab separately,
      which means it's not possible anymore to accidentally get stuck in
      fullscreen state by closing a tab with a fullscreen video.
    + (QtWebEngine) :scroll-page with --bottom-navigate now works correctly.
    + (QtWebKit) The HTTP cache is disabled on Qt 5.7.1 and 5.8 now as it leads

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Feb 25 09:38:44 UTC 2017 - otto.tuominen@openmailbox.org

- Update to version 0.9.1 (changes since 0.8.1):
  * Prevent websites from downloading files to a location outside of the download
    folder with QtWebEngine.
  * New dependency: qutebrowser now depends on the Qt QML module, which is
    packaged separately in some distributions (as Qt Declarative/QML/Quick).
  * New :rl-backward-kill-word command which does what :rl-unix-word-rubout
    did before v0.8.0.
  * New :rl-unix-filename-rubout command which is similar to readline's
    unix-filename-rubout.
  * New fonts -> completion.category setting to customize the font used for
    completion category headers.
  * New :debug-log-capacity command to adjust how many lines are logged into RAM
    (to report bugs which are difficult to reproduce).
  * New hide-unmatched-rapid-hints option to not hide hint unmatched hint labels
    in rapid mode.
  * New {clipboard} and {primary} replacements for the commandline which
    replace the :paste command.
  * New :insert-text command to insert a given text into a field on the page,
    which replaces :paste-primary together with the {primary} replacement.
  * New :window-only command to close all other windows.
  * New prev-category and next-category arguments to :completion-item-focus
    to focus the previous/next category in the completion (bound to <Ctrl-Tab>
  * and <Ctrl-Shift-Tab> by default).
  * New :click-element command to fake a click on a element.
  * New :debug-log-filter command to change console log filtering on-the-fly.
  * New :debug-log-level command to change the console loglevel on-the-fly.
  * New general -> yank-ignored-url-parameters option to configure which URL
    parameters (like utm_source etc.) to strip off when yanking an URL.
  * Support for the HTML5 page visibility API
  * New readability userscript which shows a readable version of a page (using
    the readability-lxml python package)
  * New cast userscript to show a video on a Google Chromecast
  * New :run-with-count command which replaces the (undocumented) :count:command syntax.
  * New :record-macro (q) and :run-macro (@) commands for keyboard macros.
  * New ui -> hide-scrollbar setting to hide the scrollbar independently of the
    user-stylesheet setting.
  * New general -> default-open-dispatcher setting to configure what to open
    downloads with (instead of e.g. xdg-open on Linux).
  * Support for PAC (proxy autoconfig) with QtWebKit  
  * Hints are now drawn natively in Qt instead of using web elements. This has a
    few implications for users:
        The hints -> opacity setting does not exist anymore, but you can use
        rgba(r, g, b, alpha) colors instead for colors -> hints.bg.
        The hints -> font setting is not affected by
        fonts -> web-family-fixed anymore. Thus, a transformer got added to
        change Monospace to ${_monospace}.
        Gradients in hint colors can now be configured by using qlineargradient
        and friends instead of -webkit-gradient. The most common cases get
        migrated automatically, but if you drastically changed the defaults,
        you'll need to manually adjust your config.
        Styling hints by styling qutehint elements in user-stylesheet was
        never officially supported and does not work anymore.
        Hints are now not affected by the page's stylesheet or zoom anymore.
  * :bookmark-add now has a --toggle flag which deletes the bookmark if it
    already exists.
  * :bookmark-load now has a --delete flag which deletes the bookmark after
    loading it.
  * :open now also accepts quickmark names instead of URLs
  * :tab-move now optionally takes an index for absolute moving.
  * Commands taking either an argument or a count (like :zoom or :tab-focus)
    now prefer the count instead of showing an error message.
  * :open now has an --implicit argument to treat the opened tab as implicit
    (i.e. to open it at the position it would be opened if it was a clicked link)
  * :download-open and :prompt-open-download now have an optional cmdline
    argument to pass a commandline to open the download with.
  * :yank now has a position argument to select what to yank instead of using
    flags.
  * Replacements like {url} can now also be used in the middle of an argument.
  * Consequently, commands taking another command (:later, :repeat and
    :bind) now don't immediately evaluate variables.
  * Tab titles in the :buffer completion now update correctly when a page's
    title is changed via javascript.
  * :hint now has a --mode <mode> flag to override the hint mode configured
    using the hints -> mode setting.
  * With new-instance-open-target set to a tab option, the tab is now opened in
    the most recently focused (instead of the last opened) window. This can be
    configured with the new new-instance-open-target.window setting.
  * It can also be set to last-visible to show the pages in the most recently
    visible window, or first-opened to use the first (oldest) available window.
  * Word hints now are more clever about getting the element text from some elements.
  * Completions for :help and :bind now also show hidden commands
  * The :buffer completion now also filters using the first column (id).
  * :undo has been improved to reopen tabs at the position they were closed.
  * :navigate now takes a count for up/increment/decrement.
  * The hints -> auto-follow setting now can be set to
    always/full-match/unique-match/never to more precisely control when
    hints should be followed automatically.
  * Counts can now be used with special keybindings (e.g. with modifiers).
    This was already implemented for v0.7.0 originally, but got reverted because
    it caused some issues and then never re-applied.
  * Sending a command to an existing instance (via "qutebrowser :reload") now
    doesn't mark it as urgent anymore.
  * tabs -> title-format now treats an empty string as valid.
  * Bindings for :, / and ? are now configured explicitly and not hardcoded
    anymore.
  * The completion -> show setting can now be set to always, auto or
    never.
  * :open-editor can now be used in any mode.
  * Lots of improvements to and bugfixes for the QtWebEngine backend, such as
    working hints. However, using qutebrowser directly from git is still advised
    when using --backend webengine.
    content -> javascript-can-open-windows got renamed to
    javascript-can-open-windows-automatically.
  * :prompt-accept now optionally accepts a value which overrides the one
    entered in the input box. yes and no can be used as values for yes/no
    questions.
  * The new --qt-arg and --qt-flag arguments can be used to pass
    arguments/flags to Qt's commandline.
  * Error/warning/info messages are now shown stacked above the statusbar.
  * This also added various new settings:
        colors -> messages.fg.error (renamed from statusbar.fg.error)
        colors -> messages.bg.error (renamed from statusbar.bg.error)
        colors -> messages.border.error
        colors -> messages.fg.warning (renamed from statusbar.fg.warning)
        colors -> messages.bg.warning (renamed from statusbar.bg.warning)
        colors -> messages.border.warning
        colors -> messages.fg.info
        colors -> messages.bg.info
        colors -> messages.border.info
        fonts -> messages.error
        fonts -> messages.warning
        fonts -> messages.info
  * The qute:settings page now also shows option descriptions.
  * qute:version and qutebrowser --version now show various important paths
  * :spawn/userscripts now show a nicer error when a script wasn't found
  * Various functionality now works when javascript is disabled with QtWebKit
  * Various commands/settings taking left/right/previous arguments now take
    prev/next/last-used to remove ambiguity.
  * The ui -> user-stylesheet setting now only takes filenames, not CSS snippets
  * ui -> window-title-format now has a new {backend} replacement
  * :hint has a new --add-history argument to add the URL to the history for
    yank/spawn targets.
  * :set now cycles through values if more than one argument is given.
  * :open now opens default-page without an URL even without -t/-b/-w given.
  * The :paste command got deprecated as :open with {clipboard} and
    {primary} can be used instead.

    and thus removed.
  * The :completion-item-prev and :completion-item-next commands got merged
    into a new :completion-focus {prev,next} command and thus removed.

Sat Jul 30 15:12:32 UTC 2016 - sor.alexei@meowr.ru

- Update to version 0.8.1 (changes since 0.7.0):
  * Add new ":repeat-command" command (mapped to ".") to repeat the
    last command.
    Note that two former default bundings conflict with that
    binding, unbinding them via ":unbind .i" and ":unbind .o" is
    recommended.
  * Add new "qute:bookmarks" page which displays all bookmarks and
    quickmarks.
  * Add new ":prompt-open-download" (bound to Ctrl-X) which can be
    used to open a download directly when getting the filename
    prompt.
  * Add new "{host}" replacement for tab- and window titles which
    evaluates to the current host.
  * Add new default binding ";t" for ":hint input".
  * Add new variables "$QUTE_CONFIG_DIR", "$QUTE_DATA_DIR" and
    "$QUTE_DOWNLOAD_DIR" available for userscripts.
  * Add new option "ui" -> "status-position" to configure the
    position of the status bar (top/bottom).
  * Add new "--pdf <filename>" argument for ":print" WHICH can be
    used to generate a PDF without a dialog.
  * ":scroll-perc" now prefers a count over the argument given to
    it, which means "gg" can be used with a count.
  * Aliases can now use ";;" to have an alias which executed
    multiple commands.
  * ":edit-url" now does nothing if the URL isn't changed in the
    spawned editor.
  * ":bookmark-add" can now be passed a URL and title to add that
    as a bookmark rather than the current page.
  * New "taskadd" userscript to add a taskwarrior task annotated
    with the current URL.
  * ":bookmark-del" and ":quickmark-del" now delete the current
    page's URL if none is given.
  * Fix compatibility with PyQt 5.7.
  * Fix some configuration values being lost when a config option
    gets removed from qutebrowser's code.
  * Fix a crash when downloading with a full drive.
  * Fix using ":jump-mark" (e.g. '') when the current URL is
    invalid doesn't crash anymore.
  * Fix a crash when pressing enter without a command.
  * Remove the ability to display status messages from webpages, as
    well as the related "ui" -> "display-statusbar-messages"
    setting.
  * Remove the "general" -> "wrap-search" setting as searches now
    always wrap.
    According to a quick straw poll and prior crash logs, almost
    nobody is using "wrap-search = false", and turning off wrapping
    is not possible with QtWebEngine.
  * Remove ":edit-url" now doesn't accept a count anymore as its
    behaviour was confusing and it doesn't make much sense to add a
    count.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jun 11 09:34:07 UTC 2016 - sor.alexei@meowr.ru

- Update to version 0.7.0:
  * Add new ":edit-url" command to edit the URL in an external
    editor.
  * Add new "network -> custom-headers" setting to send custom
    headers with every request.
  * Add new "{url:pretty}" commandline replacement which gets
    replaced by the decoded URL.
  * Add new marks to remember a scroll position.
  * Add new ":jump-mark" command to jump to a mark, bound to "'".
  * Add new ":set-mark" command to set a mark, bound to ```
    (backtick).
  * Now the "'" mark gets set when moving away (hinting link with
    anchor, searching, etc.) so you can move back with "''".
  * Add new "--force-color" argument to force coloured logging even
    if stdout is not a terminal.
  * Add new ":messages" command to show error messages.
  * Add new pop-up showing possible keybinding when the first key
    of a keychain is pressed. This can be turned off using
    ":set ui keyhint-blacklist *".
  * Add new "hints -> auto-follow-timeout" setting to ignore
    keypresses after following a hint when filtering in number mode.
  * Add new ":history-clear "command to clear the entire history
  * Add new "hints -> find-implementation" to select which
    implementation (JS/Python) should be used to find hints on a
    page. The javascript implementation is better, but slower.
  * Change (slightly update) logo.
  * ":tab-focus" can now take a negative index to focus the nth tab
     counted from the right.
  * ":yank" can now yank the pretty/decoded URL by adding "--pretty".
  * ":navigate" now clears the URL fragment.
  * ":completion-item-del" (Ctrl-D) can now be used in ":buffer"
    completion to close a tab.
  * Counts can now be used with special keybindings (e.g. with
    modifiers).
  * Various SSL ciphers are now disabled by default. With recent
    Qt/OpenSSL versions those already all are disabled, but with
    older versions they might not be.
  * Show favicons as window icon with tabs-are-windows set.
  * ":bind <key>" without a command now shows the existing binding.
  * The optional colorlog dependency got removed, as qutebrowser
    now displays coloured logs without it.
  * URLs are now shown decoded when hovering.
  * Keybindings are now shown in the command completion.
  * Improved behaviour when pasting multiple lines.
  * Rapid hints can now also be used for the normal hint target,
    which can be useful with javascript click handlers or
    checkboxes which don’t actually open a new page.
  * ":zoom-in" or ":zoom-out" (+/-) with a too large count now
    zooms to the smallest/largest zoom instead of doing nothing.
  * The commandline now accepts partially typed commands if they’re
    unique.
  * Number hints are now kept filtered after following a hint in
    rapid mode.
  * Number hints are now renumbered after filtering.
  * Number hints can now be filtered with multiple space-separated
    search terms.
  * "hints -> scatter" is now ignored for number hints.
  * Better history implementation which also stores titles. As a
    consequence, URLs which redirect to another URL are now added to
    the history too, marked with an -r suffix to the timestamp field.
  * Fix using ":hint links spawn" with flags – you can now use
    things like the -v argument for ":spawn" or pass flags to the
    spawned commands.
  * Various fixes for hinting corner-cases where following a link
    didn’t work or the hint was drawn at the wrong position.
  * Fix crash when downloading from an URL with SSL errors.
  * Close file handles correctly when a download failed.
  * Fix crash when using ";Y" (":hint links yank-primary") on a
    system without primary selection.
  * Don’t display quit confirmation with finished downloads.
  * Fix updating the tab index in the statusbar when opening a
    background tab.
  * Fix a crash when entering `:-- ` in the commandline.
  * Fix ":debug-console" with PyQt 5.6.
  * Fix qutebrowser not starting when sys.stderr is None.
  * Fix a crash when cancelling a download which belongs to a MHTML
    download.
  * Fix rebinding of keybindings being case-sensitive.
  * Fix for tab indicators getting lost when moving tabs.
  * Fix handling of backspace in number hinting mode.
  * Fix FileNotFoundError when starting in some cases on old Qt
    versions.
  * Fix sharing of cookies between tabs when "private-browsing" is
    enabled.
  * Toggling values with ":set" now uses lower-case values.
  * Hints now work with (non-standard) links with spaces around the
    URL.
  * Strip off trailing spaces for history entries with no title.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat May  7 07:12:54 UTC 2016 - sor.alexei@meowr.ru

    tabs -> last-close set to default-page.
  * Fix crash when starting with --cachedir="".
  * Fix crash in some circumstances when using dictionary hints.
