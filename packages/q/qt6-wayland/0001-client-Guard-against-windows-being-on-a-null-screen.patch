Subject: [PATCH 1/2] client: Guard against windows being on a null screen

calculateScreenFromSurfaceEvents uses the screen information from our
surface enter events. If this is not set yet, or refers to outputs not
yet complete we fall back to the QWindow::screen. This was introduced in
e03613524fc9f6be5c4cd7e9bdb00bc09c7f1e0b.

It was assumed that this would always be a valid value as QtBase keeps
it updated, but there are apparently paths for it to still be null.

It will be evaluated again when the surface receives a wl_enter event or
the output that we have entered is finally initialised and we will then
be marked as on the correct screen.
