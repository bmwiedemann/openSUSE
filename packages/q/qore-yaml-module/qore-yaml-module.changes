- update to 0.6:
  * improved the description for the DESERIALIZATION-ERROR exception for
  non-deserializable message bodies from HTTP servers with error responses (issue
  1033) added the YamlRpcConnection class to the YamlRpcClient module updated the
  DataStreamClient module for complex types and new internal RestClient API
  changes (issue 2073) updated the DataStreamUtil module for complex types
  fixed a bug deserializing single-quoted strings; also serialized "!number"
  values will always include the tag to avoid potential future ambiguity (issue
  2343) improved argument error messages with RPC calls in the YamlRpcHandler
  module (issue 2573)

  * new user modules for DataStream protocol support: YAML-encoded HTTP chunked
  transfers where each chunk is a unique data entity DataStreamClient user module
  DataStreamRequestHandler user module
  DataStreamUtil user module

  * user modules moved to top-level qore module directory from version-specific
  module directory since they are valid for multiple versions of qore date/time
  values (yaml !!timestamp type) are now always returned in the current time zone
  locale so that time zone rules can be applied to deserialized dates; previously
  time zone information was always lost which could cause errors when performing
  date arithmetic on deserialized yaml dates

  * fixed bugs deserializing canonically-encoded YAML strings; arbitrary-precision
  numeric values were deserialized with their precision values ignored and
  floating point +/-inf were deserialized as zero deprecated old camel-case names
  and implemented new function names confirming to the standard naming convention
  for functions
