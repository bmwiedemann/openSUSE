      * Sub-second timestamp resolutions are now supported on Unix

        favor of the new require function, which accepts arguments of either
        form accepted by the deprecated functions.

        project from an existing source tree.

  * Introduced the property `Qt.core.enableBigResources` for the creation of
    "big" Qt resources.

    the user can specify the set of plugins by type.
  * Files can be explicitly tagged as mocable now.
  * Added `protobuf` support for C++ and Objective-C.
  * Introduced the `texttemplate` module, a facility similar to qmake's
