- Update to 1.13.0
  * Added a lot more documentation.
  * Introduced module providers.
  * The `Depends` item now falls back to `pkg-config` to locate dependencies
    whose names do not correspond to a qbs module.
  * Added the concept of job pools for limiting concurrent execution of commands
    by type.
  * Added support for rules without output artifacts.
  * Added `atEnd` function to the `Process` service.
  * Added `canonicalPath` function to the `FileInfo` service.
  * Removed the need to add "import qbs" at the head of project files.
  * The `Application`, `DynamicLibrary` and `StaticLibrary` items now have
    properties for more convenient installation of target binaries.
  * Added recursive dependency scanning of GNU ld linkerscripts.
  * Added new `cpp` property `linkerVariant` to force use of `gold`, `bfd` or
    `lld`.
  * It is no longer required to call `setup-qt` before building Qt projects.
  * Introduced the property `Qt.core.enableBigResources` for the creation of
    "big" Qt resources.
  * Static builds now pull in the default set of plugins as specified by Qt, and
    the user can specify the set of plugins by type.
  * Files can be explicitly tagged as mocable now.
  * Added `protobuf` support for C++ and Objective-C.
  * Introduced the `texttemplate` module, a facility similar to qmake's
    `SUBSTITUTES` feature.
  * The `AndroidApk` item was deprecated, a normal `Application` item can be
    used instead.
  * Building Qt apps is properly supported now, by making use of the
    `androiddeployqt` tool.
  * Introduced the `autotest` module.
