Wed Apr 16 12:44:46 UTC 2025 - Christophe Marin <christophe@krop.fr>

- Update to 2.6.1
  * Command descriptions are now printed with the product name as
    the prefix instead of the suffix.
  * When building only specific products via the `-p` option,

  * The `Rule` property `explicitlyDependsOnFromDependencies`
    now matches all artifacts from the dependencies, not just
    target artifacts.

    earlier, fixing
    the problem that a non-matching version of a library could
    break project resolving if it was found before the matching
    version.
  * Added a mode that loads a build graph followed by a forced
    re-resolve.
  * In IDE mode, messages of type "error" instead of "warning"
    are now emitted
