  <title>Computing convex hulls, Delaunay triangulations and Voronoi diagrams</title>
  <description>Qhull computes the convex hull, Delaunay triangulation, Voronoi diagram, 
halfspace intersection about a point, furthest-site Delaunay triangulation, 
and furthest-site Voronoi diagram. The source code runs in 2-d, 3-d, 4-d, 
and higher dimensions. Qhull implements the Quickhull algorithm for computing 
the convex hull. It handles roundoff errors from floating point arithmetic. It 
computes volumes, surface areas, and approximations to the convex hull.

Qhull does not support constrained Delaunay triangulations, triangulation of 
non-convex surfaces, mesh generation of non-convex objects, or medium-sized 
inputs in 9-D and higher.</description>
