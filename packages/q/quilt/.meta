  <title>A Tool for Working with Many Patches</title>
  <description>Quilt allows you to easily manage large numbers of patches by keeping
track of the changes each patch makes. Patches can be applied,
un-applied, refreshed, and more.

Quilt originally was based on Andrew Morton's patch scripts found at
http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/patches/.</description>
