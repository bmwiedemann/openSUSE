The test suite does not differentiate between stdout and stderr. When
messages are printed to both, the order in which they will reach us
is apparently no guaranteed. Ideally this would be deterministic, but
until then, I don't want to waste Build Service resources with
useless rebuilds, so let's just test stdout and stderr separately.
