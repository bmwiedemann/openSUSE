- update to 1.0.1:
  * Added support for Verilog-A defined devices using
    Ngspice+OpenVAF #197. Old Qucsator+ADMS
    workflow is marked as deprecated. Ngspice >=39 is required
    to support OpenVAF.
  * Implemented variable parameter sweep analysis #189
  * Added possibility to build Qucs-S with Qt6 #190 The
    -DWITH=QT6=ON option for cmake is required.
  * The source code of the Qucs-S is Qt6 compatible now.
  * Simulator prefixes like "ngspice/" are not show anymore on
    plot traces if the plot contains data
    from only one simulator #178
  * Added TL071/TL072 opamp models
  * Added 555_timer.lib library containing the 555 timer model
  * Added extended BJT exteneded and Schottky diodes libraries
  * Change default RCL device values and simulation settings to
    prevent convergence error when putting
    together device with default values #195
  * Fixed auto-scaling issue on Windows 64-bit platform #133
