- Update to 2.0.0:
  Important notes
  * The simulator switching system was redesigned since this
    release. It allows now to switch simulation kernel without
    restart of the application. But it is required to reconfigure
    simulator paths even if it was configured for the previous
    installation. A Simulator settings dialog window will appear
    on the first application start after the update. Please
    check the simulator settings and correct if necessary to
    continue work.
