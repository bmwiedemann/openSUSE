    <comment>- Update to version 0.0.7:
  * host-run: Convert output to string
  * start: Refactor Config loading Config loading needs to behave in different ways than other commands like xdg-open and run. Move it inside the start package instead.
  * run: Simplify GITDIR sourcing
  * inception: Ignore config and profile selection
  * build(deps): bump github.com/urfave/cli/v3
  * build(deps): bump anchore/sbom-action from 0.17.7 to 0.17.8

  * build(deps): bump google.golang.org/protobuf from 1.34.2 to 1.35.2
  * Add examples for cli commands
  * Make profile setting optional Some commands in specific scenarios can infer the profile, decreasing the amount of parameters or flags to be used. Examples:
  * wayland: Show experimental warning for all subcommands
  * Add host-run subcommand
  * Refactor inception to use gRPC
  * build: Fix gofmt violations
  * build: Enable dependabot
  * build: Lock goreleaser to v2

  * build: Update main.go reference on goreleaser.
  * profiles: Preemptive pull workload images
  * profiles: Clean up CLI messages
  * wayland: Set additional params for xwayland-run Disable testing extensions and ensure the auth file is set.

    <comment>- Update to version 0.0.8:
  * obs: Remove rebuild process
  * build: Group dependabot updates
  * profiles: Check whether profile is running Instead of erroring, confirm whether the profile is running, if it isn't it is safe to delete to file and start a new profile.
  * build(deps): bump github.com/urfave/cli/v3
  * Add GPU support for podman
  * Move drive and env pkgs to internal/util
  * obs: Add rebuild_package step on push
  * Move ephemeral dir to ~/.qubesome/run Previously the ephemeral dir for qubesome was kept at /run/user/1000/qubesome, this has now moved to ~/.qubesome/run instead. Profile dirs are created inside the new dir and removed once 'qubesome start' finishes.
  * build: Add fuzz testing checks
  * profile: Enforce mTLS with inception server
  * obs: Move source project to :unstable A new long standing project will be the home of qubesome packages when changes are merged into main. The new project name is: home:pjbgf:devel:languages:go:unstable
  * build(deps): bump github.com/urfave/cli/v3
  * obs: Trigger services on PR merge
  * WSL: Eval symlink to .X11-unix dir
  * xauth: Decrease min magic cookie length to 40 This is causing issues on Tumbleweed distrobox in WSL, where the cookie being generated is 49 chars long.
  * Remove redundant files
  * xauth: Add Fuzz tests
  * clip: Show active profiles for autocomplete
  * build: Pin GH Actions. Set bump interval to monthly
  * obs: Change target project to align with branch convention
  * build: Add OBS integration (forwarded request 1229116 from pjbgf)</comment>

    <comment>- Update to version 0.0.9:
  * build: Remove .obs integration
  * build: Bump go-git to latest from main
  * Fix inception startup stutter During profile startup an inception server is initiated, with a socket file created at ~/.qubesome/run/&lt;profile&gt;/qube.sock. The profile dir was not present at the first attempt of starting a profile, which meant that a profile would need to be started, closed and started again for it to work.
  * start: Expand GITDIR for local execution When running locally, users are not required to provide a -giturl. In such cases, the GITDIR should still be expanded based on the -local path provided.
  * start: Warn users when mounting dirs that don't exist

    <comment>Update to version 0.0.10, add ref to CVE-2025-22869 boo#1239390 fixed in 0.0.9:
  * profiles: Add --detach/-d flag This new flag makes the detached mode opt-in, allowing for better user experience.
  * build(deps): bump golang.org/x/term in the golang-org group
  * profiles: Add interactive flag to start subcommand For improved debugging and troubleshooting, a new -i flag was added so that the profile container is started with all its dependencies, but the user has to then start the Window Manager.
  * profiles: Skip image pull preemption for daemonised starts
  * profiles: Inform user when pulling profile image
  * flatpak: Add install subcommand To make it easier to install all flatpaks for a given profile, enumerate through all the linked Flatpaks installing one by one.
  * build: Bump protoc to v29.3
  * build: Bump golangci-list to v1.64.5
  * build: Bump to Go 1.24
  * start: Disable self-daemon call when debug is enabled
  * Add support to run host Flatpaks A new subcommand flatpak run has been added to enable execution of Flatpaks installed on the host. The flatpak must be within an allow list of the Profile in order for it to be executed, however, no other HostAccess primitives are enforced.
  * deps: List missing container images The deps subcommand now lists all workload (and profile) images, which are not present. To check the images across different runners, use the --runner flag:
  * build(deps): bump golang.org/x/sys in the golang-org group
  * build(deps): bump google.golang.org/protobuf from 1.36.4 to 1.36.5
  * profiles: Daemonise profile start When a profile is started, it starts an inception server so that the containerised Windows Manager is able to execute new container workloads. The previous implementation required the start command to hold the process running for as long as the profile was running.
  * Fix mime handling post mTLS implementation Workloads allowed to trigger mime handling require access to the inception server. Since the mTLS implementation, this feature stopped working as that connection could no longer be established due to the missing client mTLS credentials.
  * Fix qubesome version (forwarded request 1256082 from jfkw)</comment>

    <comment>- Update to version 0.0.11:
  * firecracker: Refactoring code Split image used for network setup from the image used as the source for the rootfs. In the future, some of the qubesome specific logic in the latter should also be transitioned over to the firecracker image, so that the requirements from the workload image are decreased.
  * firecracker: Ensure docker is used for privileged ops The use of Firecracker is experimental and heavily relies on Docker for the initial creation of the rootfs and the creation of the firecracker network taps.
  * firecracker: Bump kernel to 6.1.102
  * run: Add workload name to error message
  * Update to new cli.StringArg API
  * build(deps): bump google.golang.org/grpc from 1.72.1 to 1.72.2
  * build(deps): bump the github-actions-updates group with 4 updates
  * build(deps): bump google.golang.org/grpc from 1.72.0 to 1.72.1

  * build(deps): bump the golang-org group with 2 updates
  * build(deps): bump the github-actions-updates group with 4 updates

  * build(deps): bump github.com/go-git/go-git/v5 from 5.14.0 to 5.15.0
  * build(deps): bump golang.org/x/net in the go_modules group
  * build(deps): bump the golang-org group with 2 updates
  * build(deps): bump google.golang.org/grpc from 1.71.0 to 1.71.1
  * build(deps): bump github.com/urfave/cli/v3 from 3.0.0-beta1 to 3.1.1
  * build(deps): bump the github-actions-updates group with 5 updates
  * build(deps): bump google.golang.org/protobuf from 1.36.5 to 1.36.6
  * build(deps): bump golang.org/x/net in the go_modules group
  * build: Add CodeQL workflow
  * profiles: Add desktop entries for workloads Instead of relying on users to create and map their own desktop entries, qubesome auto generate them based on all the workloads configured for the given profile.
  * build: Add OpenSSF Scorecard workflow
  * build(deps): bump the golang-org group with 2 updates
  * build(deps): bump google.golang.org/grpc from 1.70.0 to 1.71.0
  * Improve AMD GPU support Depending on the ROCm version, the binaries are not added to the PATH. Checking for /dev/kfd seems to be a more consistent way to check whether the AMD Kernel Fusion Driver is in place, which is what AMD uses.

    <comment>- Update to version 0.0.13:
  * build: Bump PROTOC to v32.1
  * build: Bump golangci-lint to v2.5.0
  * build: Remove redundant tenv linter
  * Drop redundant //nolint
  * headless: Disable mime handling The way that mime handling works at the moment, it is incompatible with headless mode. Therefore always disables it before sending the workload to the runner.
  * profiles: Mount dbus system bus path
  * run: Expose Wayland env variables to workloads
  * start: Improve start of profile in Wayland
  * Add fallback resolution In cases were xrandr or wlr-randr are not available, or return an error, fall back to a 1440x1080 resolution. This avoids silent failures which can be difficult to pinpoint.
  * Add headless subcommand
