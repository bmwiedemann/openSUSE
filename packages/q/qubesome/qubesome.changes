- Packaging improvements:
  * _service obs_scm param url add suffix .git for clarity
  * _service obs_scm param filename to align with package name
  * Align package name spelling with Go application binary name
  * Remove define github project name components no longer needed
  * Use name macro where applicable to normalize common lines
    across Go app packages. Also makes renaming binary easier when
    required to handle package name conflict.
  * Use BuildRequires: golang(API) >= 1.22 instead of go >= 1.22.
    The go metapackage points to a single go version that
    increments at a date TBD after each go1.x major release. The
    expression golang(API) is available immediately upon each go1.x
    major release and is stable for expressing the minimum version
    or a temporarily pinned version.
  * Drop autosetup -p 1 arg only needed when package has patches
  * Build PIE with pattern that may become recommended procedure:
    %%ifnarch ppc64 GOFLAGS="-buildmode=pie" %%endif go build
    A go toolchain buildmode default config would be preferable
    but none exist at this time.
  * Remove ldflags -s (Omit symbol table and debug info) and -w
    (Omit DWARF symbol table). This information is used to produce
    separate debuginfo packages and binaries are stripped for
    reduced size by GNU strip during RPM build.
  * Remove ldflags -X entries for build time stamp.
    This information is embedded in binaries with go1.18+ and
    available via go version -m or runtime/debug.ReadBuildInfo().
  * Remove go build arg -trimpath. Since this is a packaged binary,
    build environment paths do not leak private information. Other
    build scenarios such as minimal container builds could have a
    use for -trimpath. Absent a clear need, use go build defaults.
  * Add go build -o %{name}, default binary name is pkg of main().
    Our packaging uses a different name for the binary.
