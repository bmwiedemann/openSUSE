    CPs are actually used
- Updated qclib.makefile.libdir.patch to apply against the current
  version, and to make sure the two new man pages go to the right
  directory.

Tue Jan 21 18:28:32 UTC 2020 - Mark Post <mpost@suse.com>

- Upgraded to version 2.0.1 (bsc#1160745)
  Changes:
  - Retry up to three times when a live guest migration is detected
  Bug fixes:
  - Attribute qc_num_ziip_threads in CEC layer was not correctly set.
  - Do not account zIIPs in layer QC_LAYER_TYPE_ZOS_ZCX_SERVER for
    qc_num_cpu_* attributes.
  - qc_dump: Handle non-writable /tmp

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov 20 00:43:26 UTC 2019 - Mark Post <mpost@suse.com>

- Upgraded to verson 2.0.0 (jsc#SLE-7867)
  Changes:
  * New attributes in layer CEC:
       * qc_type_name
       * qc_type_family
       * qc_lic_identifier
  * qc_test: Reworked output for subtle consistency improvements
  * Replaced attribute qc_hardlimit_consumption with
    qc_limithard_consumption. Use CONFIG_V1_COMPATIBILITY for previous
    version.
  * Require CONFIG_DUMP_READING in query_capacity.h to allow running from a
    dump. Disabled by default.
  * Disabled v1 compatibility functionality per default. To re-enable,
    activate CONFIG_V1_COMPATIBILITY in query_capacity.h.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr 22 19:57:20 UTC 2019 - Mark Post <mpost@suse.com>

- Upgraded to version 1.4.1 (bsc#1135781, Fate#327836, jsc#SLE-5908)
  Bug fixes:
  * qc_dump: Don't abort the dump in case qc_test fails.
  * Attributes qc_cp_weight_capping and qc_ifl_weight_capping were set even
    when initial capping was not set in the LPAR's activation profile.
  Version 1.4.0
  Changes:
  * Added SMT support by properly differentiating between cores and CPUs.
    I.e. switched from qc_num_cpu_* to qc_num_core_* attributes in layers
    CEC, LPAR, ZVM_HYPERVISOR and KVM_HYPERVISOR.
    NOTE: qc_num_cpu_* attributes remain to be valid in these cases to
          preserve backwards compatibility for now. This will be removed in
          one of the next releases! It is recommended to switch to the new
          attributes _now_ and test with CONFIG_V1_COMPATIBILITY disabled!
  * Added new attributes qc_num_threads_cp and qc_num_threads_ifl to layers
    CEC, LPAR and ZVM_HYPERVISOR.
  * Deprecated attribute qc_mobility_eligible (remains valid for now) and
    replaced with qc_mobility_enabled to match z/VM terminology. Likewise
    switched QC_LAYER_TYPE_ZVM_CPU_POOL to QC_LAYER_TYPE_ZVM_RESOURCE_POOL.
  * Moved build customization defines (e.g. CONFIG_V1_COMPATIBILITY) to
    query_capacity.h.
  * Don't build with textual hypfs per default anymore due to unrecoverable
    issues (see section 'Bug fixes'). Since all Linux distributions ship
    with debugfs (providing binary hypfs support), overriding textual hypfs,
    for years, this change will hardly ever be noticable. Enable define
    CONFIG_TEXTUAL_HYPFS in query_capacity.h to revert.
    Note that textual hypfs support will be removed in a future release.
  Bug fixes:
  * Added an exception to consistency check to ignore inconsistencies between
    textual hypfs and STHYI for attributes qc_num_cp_total and
    qc_num_ifl_total in the LPAR layer.
    Background: Textual hypfs cannot tell whether a core is configured or
                not. It therefore reports all cores as configured, which can
                be wrong.
  Version 1.3.1
  Bug fixes:
  * Security: Fix PATH attack vulnerability when dumping (see QC_DEBUG=2)
  * STHYI: Add fallback for pre-glibc 2.16 (not using getauxval())
  * Handle mismatching STHYI and /proc/sysinfo layer counts
  * On LPAR, fix incomplete dump of binary hypfs when textual hypfs is mounted
- Dropped obsolete qclib-sles15-fix-mismatch-case-with-STHYI.patch.
- Updated qclib.makefile.libdir.patch to apply cleanly to the new version.
- Made numerous changes to the spec file based on the output from
  spec-cleaner.
- Updated qclib-rpmlintrc file to catch all duplicate file messages

- Upgraded to version 1.3.0 (Fate#325039)
  Changes:
  * Added STHYI support in LPAR
  * Added new env variable QC_DEBUG_FILE (see qc_open())
    Note: Failure to open a file for logging is now treated as a fatal error
  * Added script qc_dump to collect debug data in a standardized manner
  * Added attributes qc_layer_uuid and qc_layer_extended_name to LPAR layer
  * /proc/sysinfo parsing: Switch from "KVM/Linux" to the less strict "KVM"
    to detect KVM systems
  * Detect unregistered and closed handles
  * Makefile: Compile SONAME into shared library
  Bug fixes:
  * STHYI: Properly support cc==3&&rc==4 as introduced in APAR VM65419
  * Logs: Fix month in timestamp (was off by 1)
  * qc_test: Fix flags for qc_layer_name in QC_LAYER_TYPE_ZVM_HYPERVISOR
