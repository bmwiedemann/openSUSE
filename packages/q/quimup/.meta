  <title>A client for the music player daemon (MPD)</title>
  <description>QUIMUP is a client for the music player daemon (MPD) written in C++ and QT5.

The program can be used with most Linux desktops (KDE, GNOME, XFCE) and is covered
by the General Public License: it is free and 'open source'.
The clean interface makes controlling MPD's many features easy and intuitive.
The focus is on mouse handling: playlist management is done entirely by drag-&amp;-drop;
playback functions are directly accessible from the system tray.
Quimup turns MPD into a perfect desktop music player.
