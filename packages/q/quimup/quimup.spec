%description
QUIMUP is a client for the music player daemon (MPD) written in C++ and QT3.

The program can be used with most Linux desktops (KDE, GNOME, XFCE).
The interface offers controlling MPD's many features.
The focus is on mouse handling: playlist management is done entirely by drag-&-drop;
playback functions are directly accessible from the system tray.
