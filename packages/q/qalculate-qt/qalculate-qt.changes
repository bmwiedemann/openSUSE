  older changes list. Changes since 5.0.0:
  * Improved history list efficiency

    if delayed expression status is enabled

    available, on Windows

  * Support integer factorization of integers in matrix/vector,
    and of numerator and denominator in rational number
    (libqalculate)
  * Relaxed conditions for (x^a)^b = x^(a × b) and
    x^a × x^b = x^(a + b) when complex numbers are
    deactivated (fixes segfaults) (libqalculate)
  * Fix (ax + n)^2 > 1, where n is even and a is not 1,
    returning false (libqalculate)
  * Fix setbits() function (libqalculate)
  * Fix Number::equals(0, ..., true) when number is infinite
    (affects replace() function) (libqalculate)
