  <title>3D visualization module</title>
  <description>The Qt Graphs module enables you to visualize data in 3D as bar, scatter, and
surface graphs.
It's especially useful for visualizing depth maps and large quantities of
rapidly changing data, such as data received from multiple sensors.
The look and feel of graphs can be customized by using themes or by adding
custom items and labels
