-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr 10 04:32:15 UTC 2020 - Ismail Dönmez <idonmez@suse.com>

- Update to version 10.0.1
  * Fixes a regression in QPDFObjectHandle::getStreamData

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr  6 18:18:50 UTC 2020 - Ismail Dönmez <idonmez@suse.com>

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 27 07:52:03 UTC 2020 - Ismail Dönmez <idonmez@suse.com>

- Update to version 9.1.1
  * fix-qdf is rewritten in C++
  * Added options --is-encrypted and --requires-password for testing
    whether a file is encrypted or requires a password other than
    the supplied (or empty) password.
  * Added encrypt key to JSON options. With the exception of the
    reconstructed user password for older encryption formats,
    this provides the same information as --show-encryption but in
    a consistent, parseable format. See output of qpdf --json-help
    for details.
  * In QDF mode, be sure not to write more than one XRef stream to a
    file, even when --preserve-unreferenced is used. fix-qdf
    assumes that there is only one XRef stream, and that it appears
    at the end of the file.
  * When externalizing inline images, properly handle images whose
    color space is a reference to an object in the page's resource
    dictionary.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Nov 17 13:48:46 UTC 2019 - Ismail Dönmez <idonmez@suse.com>

- Update to version 9.1.0
  * Incorporate contribution from Masamichi Hosoda to properly handle
    signature dictionaries by not including them in object streams,
    formatting the Contents key has a hexadecimal string,
    and excluding the /Contents key from encryption and decryption.
  * Incorporate contribution from Masamichi Hosoda to provide new API
    calls for getting file-level information about input and output files,
    enabling certain operations on the files at the file level rather
    than the object level. New methods include QPDF::getXRefTable(), 
    QPDFObjectHandle::getParsedOffset(), 
    QPDFWriter::getRenumberedObjGen(QPDFObjGen), 
    and QPDFWriter::getWrittenXRefTable().
  * Support build-time and runtime selectable crypto providers.
    This includes the addition of new classes QPDFCryptoProvider
    and QPDFCryptoImpl and the recognition of the QPDF_CRYPTO_PROVIDER
    environment variable. Crypto providers are described in depth
    in Section 2.3, “Crypto Providers”.
  * Addition of the --show-crypto option in support of selectable
    crypto providers, as described in Section 2.3, “Crypto Providers”.
  * Allow :even or :odd to be appended to numeric ranges for
    specification of the even or odd pages from among the pages
    specified in the range.
* Add BR on pkgconfig(gnutls) to add support for GnuTLS for encryption
  operations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 14 11:37:37 UTC 2019 - Ismail Dönmez <idonmez@suse.com>

    that it doesn't require path splitting and works with paths
    include directories.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep 20 14:47:06 UTC 2019 - Ismail Dönmez <idonmez@suse.com>

  https://github.com/qpdf/qpdf/issues/276

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 20 08:26:03 UTC 2018 - idonmez@suse.com

- Update to version 8.2.1
  Command-line Enchancements

  * Add --keep-files-open=[yn] to override default determination
    of whether to keep files open when merging.
- Update to version 8.2.0
  Command-line Enhancements

  * Add --no-warn option to suppress issuing warning messages.
    If there are any conditions that would have caused warnings
    to be issued, the exit status is still 3.

  Bug fixesd and Optimizations

  * Performance fix: optimize page merging operation to avoid
    unnecessary open/close calls on files being merged. This
    solves a dramatic slow-down that was observed when merging
    certain types of files.
  * Optimize how memory was used for the TIFF predictor,
    drastically improving performance and memory usage for files
    containing high-resolution images compressed with Flate
    using the TIFF predictor.
  * Bug fix: end of line characters were not properly handled
    inside strings in some cases.
  * Bug fix: using --progress on very small files could cause
    an infinite loop.

  API enhancements

  * Add new class QPDFSystemError, derived from std::runtime_error,
    which is now thrown by QUtil::throw_system_error. This enables
    the triggering errno value to be retrieved.
  * Add ClosedFileInputSource::stayOpen method, enabling a
    ClosedFileInputSource to stay open during manually indicated
    periods of high activity, thus reducing the overhead of
    frequent open/close operations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun 26 10:21:32 UTC 2018 - idonmez@suse.com

- Update to version 8.1.0
  Usability improvements:

  * When splitting files, qpdf detects fonts and images that the
    document metadata claims are referenced from a page but are
    not actually referenced and omits them from the output file.
  * When merging multiple PDF files, qpdf no longer leaves all
    the files open.
  * The --rotate option's syntax has been extended to make the
    page range optional. If you specify --rotate=angle without
    specifying a page range, the rotation will be applied to
    all pages.
  * When merging multiple files, the --verbose option now prints
    information about each file as it operates on that file.
  * When the --progress option is specified, qpdf will print a
    running indicator of its best guess at how far through the
    writing process it is. 

  Bug fixes:
  
  * Properly decrypt files that use revision 3 of the standard
    security handler but use 40 bit keys 
    (even though revision 3 supports 128-bit keys).
  * Limit depth of nested data structures to prevent crashes
    from certain types of malformed (malicious) PDFs.
  * In “newline before endstream” mode, insert the required
    extra newline before the endstream at the end of object streams.

  Please see included ChangeLog for complete changelog including
  API changes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar  5 10:46:36 UTC 2018 - idonmez@suse.com

- Update to version 8.0.1
  * Handle zlib streams with data checksum errors
  * In the command line tool, allow specification of page numbers
    counting from the end in page ranges.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb 27 08:36:48 UTC 2018 - idonmez@suse.com

- Update to version 8.0.0
  * QPDFObjectHandle::getUTF8Val now properly treats non-Unicode
    strings as encoded with PDF Doc Encoding.
  * Add the option --coalesce-contents can be used to combine
    content streams of a page whose contents are an array of
    streams into a single stream.
  * Add function qpdf_check_pdf to the C API. This function does
    basic checking that is a subset of what qpdf --check performs.
  * Major enhancements to the lexical layer of qpdf. For a complete
    list of enhancements, please refer to the ChangeLog file.
  * New API for working with PDF content streams at a lexical level.
    The new class QPDFObjectHandle::TokenFilter allows the developer
    to provide token handlers.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb  5 09:41:13 UTC 2018 - idonmez@suse.com

- Update to version 7.1.1
  * Fix one linearization bug affecting files whose first /ID
    component is not 16 bytes long
  * Fix some build issues
- Add signature and keyring

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan 24 03:47:54 UTC 2018 - avindra@opensuse.org

- Update to version 7.1.0
  * Allow raw encryption key to be specified in libary and command
    line with the QPDF::setPasswordIsHexKey method and
    --password-is-hex-key option. Allow encryption key to be displayed
    with --show-encryption-key option. See 
    https://blog.didierstevens.com/2017/12/28/cracking-encrypted-pdfs-part-3/
    for a discussion of using this for cracking encrypted PDFs. I hope
    that a future release of qpdf will include some additional
    recovery options that may also make use of this capability.
  * Fix lexical error: the PDF specification allows floating point
    numbers to end with "."
  * Fix link order in the build to avoid conflicts when building
    from source while an older version of qpdf is installed
  * Add support for TIFF predictor for LZW and Flate streams. Now
  * Clarify documentation around options that control parsing but
    not output creation. Two options: --suppress-recovery and
    --ignore-xref-streams, were documented in the "Advanced
    Transformation Options" section of the manual and --help output
    even though they are not related to output. These are now
    described in a separate section called "Advanced Parsing Options."
  * Implement remaining PNG filters for decode. Prior versions could
    decode only the "up" filter. Now all PNG filters (sub, up,
    average, Paeth, optimal) are supported for decoding.
    The implementation of the remaining PNG filters changed the
    interface to the private Pl_PNGFilter class, but this class's
    header file is not in the installation, and there is no public
    interface to the class. Within the library, the class is never
    allocated on the stack; it is only ever dynamically allocated. As
    such, this does not actually break binary compatibility of the
    library.  all predictor functions are supported
- cleanup with spec-cleaner

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 20 11:47:37 UTC 2017 - idonmez@suse.com

- Update to version 7.0.0
  * License is now Apache-2.0
  * Add new libjpeg8-devel dependency
  * Improve the error message that is issued when QPDFWriter
	encounters a stream that can't be decoded. In particular, mention
	that the stream will be copied without filtering to avoid data
	loss.
  * Add new methods to the C API to correspond to new additions to
	QPDFWriter:
	- qpdf_set_compress_streams
	- qpdf_set_decode_level
	- qpdf_set_preserve_unreferenced_objects
	- qpdf_set_newline_before_endstream
  * Add support for writing PCLm files
  * QPDF now supports reading and writing streams encoded with
    JPEG or RunLength encoding. Library API enhancements and
    command-line options have been added to control this
    behavior. See command-line options --compress-streams
    and --decode-level and methods QPDFWriter::setCompressStreams
    and QPDFWriter::setDecodeLevel.
  * Page rotation is now supported and accessible from both the
    library and the command line.
  * Fixes CVE-2017-12595 bsc#1055960, CVE-2017-9208 bsc#1040311
