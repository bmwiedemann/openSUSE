Subject: increase x86_64 physical bits to 42
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Allow for guests with higher amounts of ram. The current thought
is that 2TB specified on qemu commandline would be an appropriate
limit. Note that this requires the next higher bit value since
the highest address is actually more than 2TB due to the pci
memory hole.
