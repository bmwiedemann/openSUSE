Subject: iotests: Skip test 079 if it is not possible to create large files

Git-commit: e28582fdb28b2e8b29a351c20b0c8f1af4120688

Test 079 fails in the arm64, s390x and ppc64le LXD containers on Travis
(which we will hopefully enable in our CI soon). These containers
apparently do not allow large files to be created. Test 079 tries to
create a 4G sparse file, which is apparently already too big for these
containers, so check first whether we can really create such files before
executing the test.
