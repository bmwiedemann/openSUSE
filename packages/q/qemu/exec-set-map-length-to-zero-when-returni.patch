Subject: exec: set map length to zero when returning NULL
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Git-commit: 77f55eac6c433e23e82a1b88b2d74f385c4c7d82
References: bsc#1172386, CVE-2020-13659

When mapping physical memory into host's virtual address space,
'address_space_map' may return NULL if BounceBuffer is in_use.
Set and return '*plen = 0' to avoid later NULL pointer dereference.
