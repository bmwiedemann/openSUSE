Subject: configure: remove $pkgversion from CONFIG_STAMP input to broaden
 compatibility

As part of the effort to close the gap with Leap I think we are fine
removing the $pkgversion component to creating a unique CONFIG_STAMP.
This stamp is only used in creating a unique symbol used in ensuring the
dynamically loaded modules correspond correctly to the loading qemu.
The default inputs to producing this unique symbol are somewhat reasonable
as a generic mechanism, but specific packaging and maintenance practices
might require the default to be modified for best use. This is an example
of that.
