SLES 15 SP4 QEMU/KVM RELATED SUPPORT STATEMENTS
===============================================

Overview
--------

  The QEMU based packages included with SLES 15 SP4 provide a large variety of
  features, from the very latest customer requests to features of questionable
  quality or value. The linux kernel includes components which contribute KVM
  virtualization features as well. This document was created to assist the user
  in deciding which features can be relied upon to build enterprise class
  virtualization solutions. KVM based virtualization for x86 (Intel 64/AMD64),
  for IBM System z (s390x), and for the ARM64 architecture (AArch64) are offered
  at the L3 (full support) level. The bulk of this document deals with L3
  supported features and is primarily s390x centric. This document should be
  considered a companion to the standard virtualization documentation delivered
  with the product.

  KVM is implemented in linux kernel modules which enable the linux kernel to
  function as an integral part of the KVM hypervisor. The hypervisor-guest
  interaction is managed by QEMU through the /dev/kvm ioctl interface. The linux
  host assists in the virtualization of storage, networking and display
  resources as well as allowing direct hardware passthrough of PCI devices.
  Linux memory and cpu management features are used by QEMU/KVM to enable guests
  to share those host resources as efficiently as possible.

  QEMU is a primary component of KVM based virtualization. The legacy qemu-kvm
  program is available for continuity with pre SLES 12 usage, including in
  libvirt domain xml references. The QEMU emulator binary qemu-system-s390x is
  now the primary program to use to access KVM virtualization. When using this
  program, the -machine option accel=kvm (or its alias -enable-kvm) or --accel
  kvm option must be specified for KVM acceleration to be used by the guest.

  Libvirt is the preferred means of accessing QEMU/KVM functionality and is
  documented elsewhere. This document focuses on the features and direct usage
  of QEMU/KVM as provided by the QEMU based packages.

Major QEMU/KVM Supported Features
---------------------------------

- KVM virtualization is accomplished by using the QEMU program in KVM
  acceleration mode. KVM acceleration requires that both guest and host have
  the same fundamental architecture.

- Guest images created under previous QEMU versions are supported by machine
  version compatibilities built into more recent QEMU versions.

- For ease of use, the QEMU program has defaults which represent traditional
  usage patterns.

- Guest virtual machine characteristics are specified by a combination of
  internal defaults, options provided on the QEMU program command-line, runtime
  configurations set via the monitor interfaces and optional config files. The
  runtime control of a VM is effected either through the Human Monitor
  "Protocol" (HMP), or the JSON based programmatical QEMU Monitor Protocol (QMP)
  interface. For QMP details, see qemu-qmp-ref man page.
  Since a KVM guest runs in the context of a normal linux process, some types
  of execution controls are managed with linux tools.

- QEMU incorporates virtualized, s390 specific, ccw bus based firmware for
  booting s390 guests. This firmware is automatically incorporated and
  doesn't need to be explicitly referenced.

- Some QEMU messages have been localized to various languages. This is provided
  by the optional qemu-lang package. Keyboard mappings for various nationalities
  is also provided.

- Virtual machine lifecycle controls include startup through the ccw firmware or
  kernel boot, firmware based shutdown, execution pausing, the saving and
  restoring of machine state or disk state, VM migration to another host, and
  miscellaneous controls available through the "monitors" mentioned above.

- Guest execution state may be "moved" in both time (save/restore) and space
  (static and live migration). These migrations or save/restore operations can
  take place either from certain prior SLES versioned hosts to a SLES 15 SP4
  host or between hosts of the same version. Certain other restrictions also
  apply.

- Security considerations include privileged helpers and a security model which
  allows running guests as a non-root user.

- QEMU provides best effort reuse of existing disk images, including those with
  systems installed, through geometry probing. Also disk images produced by
  other popular virtualization technologies may be imported into QEMU supported
  storage formats. These QEMU formats include features which exploit the
  benefits of virtualization.

- Memory, cpu and disk space overcommit are possible and can be beneficial when
  done responsibly. Additional management of these resources comes in the form
  of memory ballooning or hotplug, host KSM, vcpu hot-add, online disk resizing,
  trim, discard and hole punching.

- Guest performance is enhanced through the use of virtio devices, various disk
  caching modes, network acceleration via the vhost-net kernel module, multi-
  queue network transmit capabilities, host transparent huge pages (THP) and
  direct hugetlb usage. Physical PCI devices may also be passed through to the
  guest, including SR-IOV VF's.

- The guest UI is accessable via GTK, VNC, and serial (including curses TUI)
  interfaces.

- Guest timekeeping is supported in a variety of ways, including a paravirtual
  clocksource, and options for the various guest clocks for how to handle the
  timeslicing of the guest's execution on the host.

- In addition to the para-virtualized devices already mentioned, other devices
  and infrastructure designed to avoid virtualization "problem areas" are
  available such as SPICE graphics, vmmouse emulation, tablet style pointer
  interfaces and virtio based UI interfaces.

- A built-in user-mode network (SLIRP) stack is available.

- Portions of the host file system may be shared with a guest by using virtFS.

- A guest "agent" is available for SLES 15 SP4 KVM guests via the
  qemu-guest-agent package. This allows some introspection and control of the
  guest OS environment from the host.

QEMU/KVM Technology Previews
----------------------------

- All features indicated as not being supported in this document fall under the
  Technology Preview definition contained in the main product's release notes.

Noteworthy QEMU/KVM Unsupported Features
----------------------------------------

- Note that some features are unsupported simply due to lack of validation. If
  an existing feature is desired, but not marked supported, let SUSE know about
  your requirements.

- The TCG "acceleration" mode may be helpful for problem isolation, but
  otherwise presents insufficient benefit and stability.

- GlusterFS integration is not enabled.

Deprecated, Superseded, Modified and Dropped Features
-----------------------------------------------------

- https://qemu-project.gitlab.io/qemu/about/deprecated.html and
  https://qemu-project.gitlab.io/qemu/about/removed-features.html
  These websites track features deprecation and removal at the upstream
  development level. Our qemu package inherits this community direction, but be
  aware that we can and will deviate as needed. Those deviations and additional
  information can be found in this section. Feature deprecation as well as
  removed features are also tracked in the "System Emulation" section of the
  documentation installed with the qemu package.

- qemu-img: Deprecate use of -b without -F. Creating an image that requires
  format probing of the backing image is potentially unsafe and is now
  deprecated.

- The previously non-persistent backing file with pmem=on is deprecated. Modify
  VM configuration to set pmem=off to continue using fake NVDIMM with backing
  file or move backing file to NVDIMM storage and keep pmem=on.

- The use of "?" as a parameter to "-cpu", "-soundhw", "-device", "-M",
  "-machine" and "-d" is now considered deprecated. Use "help"
  instead.

- The use of "if=scsi" as a parameter to "-drive" does not work anymore with PC
  machine types, as it created an obsolete SCSI controller model.

- Use of aio=native without direct cache mode also being specified (cache=none,
  cache=directsync, or cache.direct=on) is no longer allowed.

- The use of image encryption in qcow and qcow2 formats is now considered
  deprecated.
  Analysis has shown it to be weak encryption, in addition to suffering from
  poor design. Images can easily be converted to a non-encrypted format.

- Use of acpi, boot-opts, and smp-opts in a -readconfig config file are now
  considered deprecated. In the future those names will be standardized to
  acpitable, boot, and smp respectively.

- These previously supported command line options are now considered deprecated:
  -display sdl,window_close= (use -display sdl,window-close)
  -no-quit (use -display ...,window-close=off)
  -chardev tty (use serial name instead)
  -chardev paraport (use parallel name instead)
  -device virtio-blk,scsi= (use virtio-scsi instead)
  -device virtio-blk-pci,scsi= (use virtio-scsi instead)
  -enable-fips (not really helpful - see https://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=commit;h=166310299a1e7824bbff17e1f016659d18b4a559 for details)
  -realtime mlock= (use -overcommit mem-lock= instead)
  -spice password=string (use password-string option instead)
  -writeconfig (no replacement - never really worked right)
  -share and noshare must be replaced by share=on/share=off
  -nodelay must be replaced by nodelay=on rather than delay=off
  -object-add options opened=on and loaded=on (both had no effect)

- These previously supported command line options are no longer supported:
  <previously mentioned items have been moved to another category>

- These previously supported command line options are no longer recognized:
  -balloon (use -device virtio-balloon instead)
  -clock
  -device ivshmem (use ivshmem-doorbell or ivshmem-plain instead)
  -device pc-sysfw (no longer needed)
  -device pci-assign, -device kvm-pci-assign (use -device vfio-pci instead)
  -display sdl
  -no-frame
  -nodefconfig (use -no-user-config instead)
  -realtime ...
  -sdl
  -show-cursor
  -virtioconsole (use -device virtconsole instead)

- Specifying a cpu feature with both "+feature/-feature" and "feature=on/off"
  will now cause a warning. The current behavior for this combination where
  "+feature/-feature" wins over "feature=on/off", will be changed going forward
  so that "+feature" and "-feature" will be synonyms for "feature=on" and
  "feature=off" respectively.

- The previously supported blkdev-add QMP command has been flagged as lacking
  and could possibly change syntax in the future.

- These previously unsupported command line options are now deprecated:
  -bt
  -soundhw (use -device ... instead)

- These previously unsupported command line options are no longer recognized:
  -device ide-drive (use ide-hd or ide-cd)
  -device mmio_interface
  -device ramfb
  -device scsi-disk (use scsi-hd or scsi-cd)
  -device vhost-user-vsock-pci-transitional
  -device vhost-vsock-pci-transitional
  -device virtio-iommu-pci-transitional
  -enable-hax
  -tb-size
  -tdf
  -xen-create

- These previously supported QMP commands are now deprecated:
  <previously mentioned items have been moved to another category>

- These previously supported QMP commands are no longer recognized:
  info cpustats
  block_passwd
  change (use blockdev-change-medium or change-vnc-password instead)
  cpu-add (use device_add instead)
  migrate-set-cache-size (use migrate-set-parameters instead)
  migrate_set_downtime (use migrate-set-parameters instead)
  migrate_set_speed (use migrate-set-parameters instead)
  query-cpus (use query-cpus-fast instead)
  query-events
  query-migrate-cache-size (use query-migrate-parameters instead)

- These previously supported monitor commands are now deprecated:
  change

- These previously supported monitor commands are no longer recognized:
  info cpustats
  block_passwd ...
  cpu-add (use device_add instead)
  migrate_set_cache_size
  migrate_set_downtime
  migrate_set_speed
  pci_add (use device_add instead)
  pci_del (use device_del instead)

- These previously unsupported monitor command are now deprecated:
  <previously mentioned items have been moved to another category>

- These previously unsupported monitor commands are no longer recognized:
  acl_add ...
  acl_policy ...
  acl_remove ...
  acl_reset ...
  acl_show ...
  host_net_add
  host_net_remove
  usb_add
  usb_del

- These previously unsupported QMP commands are now supported under a new name:
  x-block-dirty-bitmap-disable (use block-dirty-bitmap-disable instead)
  x-block-dirty-bitmap-enable (use block-dirty-bitmap-enable instead)
  x-block-dirty-bitmap-merge (use block-dirty-bitmap-merge instead)
  x-block-latency-histogram-set (use block-latency-histogram-set instead)
  x-blockdev-create (use blockdev-create instead)

- This previously unsupported QMP commands is no longer recognized:
  x-nbd-server-add-bitmap

- Due to upstream's decision to no longer fully support the qed storage format
  going forward (since it really provides no benefit over qcow2 and is now no
  longer actively maintained upstream), creating qed storage images is no longer
  supported and it is highly discouraged to continue using existing qed images.
  They should instead be converted to another supported format.

QEMU Command-Line and Monitor Syntax and Support
------------------------------------------------

- The QEMU program command-line syntax is as follows:
  qemu-system-s390x [options]

  Where 'options' are taken from the options listed below.
  The images used with -drive or -cdrom, may be in the raw (no format) or qcow2
  storage formats, and may be located in files within the host filesystem,
  logical volumes, host physical disks, or network based storage. Read only
  media may also be accessed via URL style protocol specifiers.

  Note that as a general rule, as new command line options are added which serve
  to replace an older option or interface, you are strongly encouraged to adapt
  your usage to the new option. The new option is being introduced to provide
  better functionality and usability going forward. In some cases existing
  problems or even bugs in older interfaces cannot be fixed due to functional
  expectations, but are resolved in the newer interface or option.
  This advice includes moving to the most recent machine type (eg
  s390-ccw-virtio-6.1 instead of s390-ccw-virtio-6.0) if possible.
