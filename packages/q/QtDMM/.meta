  <title>DMM Readout Software Including a Configurable Recorder</title>
  <description>QtDMM is a DMM readout software including a configurable recorder. The
recorder features manual start, scheduled start (at a given time), and
triggered automatic start when given thresholds are reached.
Additionally, you can start an external application when given
thresholds are reached.

Although initially written for Metex (and compatible, like VOLTCRAFT)
multimeter, which use a 14-byte protocol, several more protocols have
been added. For more information about the currently supported DMMs,
refer to the preset table.</description>
