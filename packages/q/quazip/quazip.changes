- Update to version 0.7.1
  * Fixed licensing issues (bug #45).
  * Added the convenience method QuaZipFileInfo::isEncrypted().
- Changes from version 0.7
  * It is now possible to write ZIP files to sequential devices like 
    sockets (only in mdCreate mode, so no self-extract, sorry).
  * A few zip64 fixes.
  * Several bug fixes and portability improvements.
- Changes from version 0.6.2
  * QuaZipNewInfo / QuaZipFileInfo64 now provide API to access/set
    NTFS time stamps - useful even on non-NTFS systems if you 
    need more precise dates and times than default ones.
  * QuaZipNewInfo may now be initialized from QuaZipFileInfo64.
  * No more crashes when using QSaveFile as QIODevice for ZIP.
  * The new QuaZip::setAutoClose() method allows to leave the
    QIODevice open when you close the QuaZip instance.
  * qztest now depends on quazip, no longer breaking the build.
- Changes from version 0.6.1
  * Improved zip64 support.
  * A LOT more tests thanks to g++ --coverage / lcov.
  * JlCompress extraction methods now create files with default
    permissions if they are zero in the original archive.
  * Some QuaZipDir fixes (thanks to the new tests).
- Changes from version 0.6
  * Minizip updated to 1.1 (with all the necessary modifications
    re-done), and that means that...
  * the long-awaited zip64 support is now available!
  * A few rather minor fixes.
- Changes from version 0.5.2
  * Some minor bug fixes.
  * API to access file permissions subfield of the external
    attributes.
  * MS VS 2012 Express support.
  * API to set the default codec used to encode/decode file names
    (mainly for use by various wrappers such as JlCompress, when
    you don't have direct access to the underlying QuaZip instance).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb  6 22:46:59 UTC 2015 - dev@dominik-schmidt.de

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Sep  7 20:09:12 UTC 2013 - stefan@fam-elser.de

- Update to 0.5.1 version:
  * Lots of QuaZipDir fixes, thanks to all bug reporters.
  * Full Qt Creator support.
  * MS VS 2010 Express support.
  * Qt5 support (didn't need any source code changes anyway).
  * Lots of minor bug fixes. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Dec 15 20:32:37 UTC 2012 - p.drouand@gmail.com

- Update to 0.5 version:
  * Added run_moc.bat files for building under Windows in case Qt
    integration is not available (e. g. VS 2008 Express).
  * Added the QuaZipDir class to simplify ZIP navigation in terms
    of directories.
  * Added the QuaGzipFile class for working with GZIP archives. It
    was added as a bonus since it has nothing to do with the main
    purpose of the library. It probably won't get any major
    improvements, although minor bug fixes are possible.
  * Added the QuaZIODevice class for working with zlib
    compression. It has nothing to do with the ZIP format, and
    therefore the same notice as for the QuaGzipFile applies.
  * The global comment is no longer erased when adding files to
    an archive.
  * Many bug fixes.
