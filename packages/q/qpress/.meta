  <title>File archiver designed for speed</title>
  <description>qpress is a portable file archiver using QuickLZ and designed to utilize
fast storage systems to their max. It's often faster than file copy
because the destination is smaller than the source. A few features:

* multiple cores, reaching upto 1.1 Gbyte/s in-memory compression on a 
  quad core i7
* 64-bit file sizes and tested with terabyte sized archives containing 
  millions of files and directories
* pipes and redirection and *nix-like behaviour for scripting and 
  flexibility
* Adler32 checksums to ensure that decompressed data has not been corrupted
* data recovery of damaged archives with 64 Kbyte grannularity
