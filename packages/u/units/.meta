  <title>Units Conversion Utility</title>
  <description>The 'units' program converts quantities expressed in various scales to
their equivalents in other scales.

Units can also convert temperature values (Fahrenheit to Celsius, for
example) but this needs a slightly different input syntax. See the man
page for details.</description>
