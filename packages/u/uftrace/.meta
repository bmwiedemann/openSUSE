  <title>A function call graph tracer for C, C++, Rust and Python programs</title>
  <description>uftrace is a function call graph tracer for C, C++, Rust and Python programs.
It was heavily inspired by the ftrace framework of the Linux kernel, and its
name reflects this origin â€” a combination of 'user' and 'ftrace'.

uftrace records function entry and exit with timestamps, arguments, and return
values, and can trace user and kernel functions, library calls, and system
events to provide a unified timeline of execution. It also offers filtering
and visualization features such as Chrome trace viewer integration, flame
graphs, and call-graph diagrams.</description>
