    <comment>- Initial submit of uftrace (v0.18.1)

uftrace is a function call graph tracer for C, C++, Rust, and Python programs.
It records function entry/exit with timestamps, arguments, and return values,
and correlates user-space, kernel functions, library calls, and system events
on a single timeline.

It supports compiler-assisted tracing and dynamic patching (no rebuild needed
when symbols exist), PLT hooking, and scripting via Python/LuaJIT. Results can
be filtered and visualized with Chrome trace viewer, flame graphs, and
call-graph diagrams.
