  <title>A unique, custom designed font that has a very distinctive look and feel</title>
  <description>The Ubuntu Font Family are a set of matching new libre/open fonts. 
The development is being funded by Canonical on behalf the wider 
Free Software community and the Ubuntu project. The technical font 
design work and implementation is being undertaken by Dalton Maag.

Both the final font Truetype/OpenType files and the design files 
used to produce the font family are distributed under an open 
licence and you are expressly encouraged to experiment, modify, 
share and improve. The typeface is sans-serif, uses OpenType 
features and is manually hinted for clarity on desktop and 
mobile computing screens.

The scope of the Ubuntu Font Family includes all the languages 
used by the various Ubuntu users around the world in tune with 
Ubuntu's philosophy which states that every user should be able 
to use their software in the language of their choice. So the 
Ubuntu Font Family project will be extended to cover many more 
written languages.
