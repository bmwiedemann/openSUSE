%description
Some projects like a file server need privilege separation to be able to switch
to the connnection user and do file operations. uid_wrapper convincingly lies
to the application, letting it believe it is operating as root and even
switching betwen UIDs and GIDs as needed.

To use it, set the following environment variables:

LD_PRELOAD=libuid_wrapper.so
UID_WRAPPER=1

This package does not have a devel package, because this project is for
development/testing.

# CMAKE_SKIP_RPATH:BOOL=OFF is need to run the tests!
