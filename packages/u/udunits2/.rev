    <comment>dsteuer requested to include this package into factory. It is needed by some R packages,
and is used in several scientific software packages (which are potentially-to-be-included-in-factory) as cdo or nco. The compat parts are not really needed, but they just provide some symlinks and do no harm.

Request has been enhanced with splitting off libudunits2-0 as requested 
and some minor cleanup.</comment>
