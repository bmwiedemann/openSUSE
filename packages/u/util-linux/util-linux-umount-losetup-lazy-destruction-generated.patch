 The \fBumount\fP command will automatically detach loop device previously initialized by \fBmount\fP(8) command independently of \fI/etc/mtab\fP.
 .sp
 In this case the device is initialized with "autoclear" flag (see \fBlosetup\fP(8) output for more details), otherwise it\(cqs necessary to use the option \fB\-\-detach\-loop\fP or call \fBlosetup \-d\fP \fIdevice\fP. The autoclear feature is supported since Linux 2.6.25.
+.sp
+Note that since Linux v3.7 kernel uses "lazy device destruction". The system just marks the loop device by autoclear flag and destroys it later. If you need to wait for a complete removal of the loop device, call \fBudevadm settle\fP after \fBumount\fP.
