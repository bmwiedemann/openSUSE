+.SS Blacklisted file systems
+In the Linux kernel, file system types are implemented as kernel
+modules. While many of these file systems are well maintained,
+some of the older and less frequently used ones are not. This
+poses a security risk, because maliciously crafted file system
+images might open security holes when mounted either automatically
+or by an inadvertent user. The
+.B mount
+command prints "unsupported file system type 'somefs'" in this case,
+because it can't distinguish between a really unsupported file system
+(kernel module non-existent) and a blacklisted file system.
+
+Users who need the blacklisted file systems and therefore want
+to override the blacklisting can either load the blacklisted module
+directly:
+.RS

+.I /etc/modprobe.d
+directory.
