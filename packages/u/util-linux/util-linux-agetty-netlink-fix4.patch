Subject: [PATCH 6/7] agetty: Process all data from ul_nl_process()

However select() normally triggers immediately after a partial read, it does not
happen for netlink socket. It keeps unprocessed data until the next netlink
message appears. It causes raising processing delays.

Always read all data. It also potentially decreases number of issue redraws.
