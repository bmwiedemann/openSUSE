Subject: [PATCH] Revert "libblkid: try LUKS2 first when probing"
References: https://github.com/util-linux/util-linux/pull/2373

mdadm superblocks before 1.1 are placed at the end of the device, which
means that the data contained inside the array starts at offset 0. For
LUKS inside MD, blkid falsely detects this as plain LUKS instead of a
linux_raid_member. This causes e.g. dracut to not assemble the array
during boot and system startup fails.

This reverts commit b8889c0a214aeb3dd47bf1ab280fe5534b64d2aa.
