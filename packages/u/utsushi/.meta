  <description>This software provides applications to easily turn hard-copy documents and
imagery into formats that are more amenable to computer processing.

Included are a native driver for a number of EPSON scanners and a compatibility
driver to interface with software built around the SANE standard.

This is the community maintained fork, based on imagescan upstream.
