    and improve search behaviour with some control points
    (BubbleUPnP and Linn Kazoo).

- update to 1.6.0:

    environment variables named UPMPD_xxx where xxx is the upper-cased
    version of the variable name. This should facilitate running
    upmpdcli in a container.
  * Change the names of the low level UPnP library log variables from
    UPMPDCLI_xxx to UPMPD_xxx and manage them in the same way as the rest
    (with config entries too).
  * Allow substituting the host name (%h,%H) and version info (%v) in
    the configured friendlyname. The default friendlyname is now UpMpd-%h
  * Uprcl: use same host as upmpdcli by default. Add uprclport configuration
    variable to only set the port

Thu Apr 15 07:57:18 UTC 2021 - Michael Pujos <pujos.michael@gmail.com>

- update to 1.5.11:
  * Fix rare possible issue with Kazoo volume control
  * Passthrough for CDDA urls. An URL of the form:
    http://upmpdprotoescape/cdda/dev/sr0/1
    will be translated to: cdda:///dev/sr0/1
    This hack allows tunneling CDDA URLs, which mpd understands but
    some control points donâ€™t like, for example, to construct a
    playlist which will play the tracks from a CD device
  * Reconnect the event loop when mpd restarts. Before the fix,
    events stopped being generated after mpd restarted
  * Radio metadata issues fixed
  * Media Server: Deezer streaming service plugin
  * Fix events not working when mpd had password set

  * Fix issue with removing tracks from the playlist (sometimes slow or freezed).
  * Fix bad locking causing multiple execs of radio scripts.
