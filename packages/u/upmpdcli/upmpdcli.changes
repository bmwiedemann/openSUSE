Thu Apr 15 07:57:18 UTC 2021 - Michael Pujos <pujos.michael@gmail.com>

- update to 1.5.11:
  * Fix rare possible issue with Kazoo volume control
  * Passthrough for CDDA urls. An URL of the form:
    http://upmpdprotoescape/cdda/dev/sr0/1
    will be translated to: cdda:///dev/sr0/1
    This hack allows tunneling CDDA URLs, which mpd understands but
    some control points donâ€™t like, for example, to construct a
    playlist which will play the tracks from a CD device
  * Reconnect the event loop when mpd restarts. Before the fix,
    events stopped being generated after mpd restarted
  * Radio metadata issues fixed
  * Media Server: Deezer streaming service plugin
  * Fix events not working when mpd had password set

-------------------------------------------------------------------

    (>60S, play transition started from other client was not detected)
  * Fix ohinfo issue resulting in no cover art display in Kazoo "currently playing" screen.
  * Fix a number of issues in radio metadata.

Wed Dec  9 13:56:21 UTC 2020 - Michael Pujos <pujos.michael@gmail.com>

- update to 1.5.5:
  * Fix issue with removing tracks from the playlist (sometimes slow or freezed).
  * Fix bad locking causing multiple execs of radio scripts.
  * Setting lumincompat = 1 is not useful any more and crashes some Kazoo versions.
    So you should keep the default value which is off.
  * Improve metadata processing when playing radios with BubbleDS.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov 25 12:31:40 UTC 2020 - Michael Pujos <pujos.michael@gmail.com>
