- Update to 1.7.7:
  * Media Server: fix issues in upnp-to-recoll search translation,
    and improve search behaviour with some control points
    (BubbleUPnP and Linn Kazoo).
  * Fix potential issues with parallel requests.
  * Uprcl: index artist documents so that they can be searched for
  * When a search request is relative to objid "0", use the plugin
    root instead of last browsed container.
  * Avoid phantom entries by adjusting the result count for entries
    filtered out by class.
- Update to 1.7.2:
  * Fix URL comparison issue which could cause false diags in checkContentFormat()
  * Change the default value for checkcontentformat from true to false.
  * Qobuz: always use https.
  * New radio-browser Media Server plugin for https://www.radio-browser.info/
  * Ensure that we exit when getting a terminating signal while waiting
    for mpd during init
- Update to 1.7.1:
  * Uprcl Media Server: report composers as <upnp:artist role="Composer">
  * Uprcl: fix possible infinite loop while parsing search string.
- Update to 1.7.0:
  * Media Server: implement rootalias parameter to point to arbitrary
    container inside the tree. This is to avoid useless navigation from
    the actual root for people who, e.g., only use the uprcl '[folders]' tree.
  * Uprcl: support multiple values for tags (e.g. multiple genres).
  * Uprcl: fix miscellaneous small issues.
  * Removed Spotify support as libspotify does not work any more.

Sat Dec  3 11:08:35 UTC 2022 - Michael Pujos <pujos.michael@gmail.com>

- update to 1.6.2:
  * Media Server: uprcl, qobuz, upradios: properly implement
    UPnP Browse(Metadata), for the sole use of Kodi, probably.
  * Uprcl container sort: sort by file names if there are no tags
    (e.g. wav files).
  * Uprcl: add uprclnotag view configuration variable to disable the
    "Tag View" entries in the folders tree.   
  * Make configuration parameter names case-insensitive
  * Small bugs fixes
- update to 1.6.1:
  * uprcl: process custom tags (not predefined anywhere) as regular ones.
  * main: change order of media server and renderer initialisations so
    that the media server does not have to wait for mpd.
- update to 1.6.0:
  * Allow all configuration variables to also be set through
    environment variables named UPMPD_xxx where xxx is the upper-cased
    version of the variable name. This should facilitate running
    upmpdcli in a container.
  * Change the names of the low level UPnP library log variables from
    UPMPDCLI_xxx to UPMPD_xxx and manage them in the same way as the rest
    (with config entries too).
  * Allow substituting the host name (%h,%H) and version info (%v) in
    the configured friendlyname. The default friendlyname is now UpMpd-%h
  * Uprcl: use same host as upmpdcli by default. Add uprclport configuration
    variable to only set the port
- update to 1.5.20:
  * Uprcl: preserve stored playlist order
  * Uprcl: choose folder image file rather than track-embedded art for folder or album
  * Uprcl: misc fixes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun  1 15:20:02 UTC 2022 - Michael Pujos <pujos.michael@gmail.com>

Thu Apr 15 07:57:18 UTC 2021 - Michael Pujos <pujos.michael@gmail.com>

- update to 1.5.11:
  * Fix rare possible issue with Kazoo volume control
  * Passthrough for CDDA urls. An URL of the form:
    http://upmpdprotoescape/cdda/dev/sr0/1
    will be translated to: cdda:///dev/sr0/1
    This hack allows tunneling CDDA URLs, which mpd understands but
    some control points don’t like, for example, to construct a
    playlist which will play the tracks from a CD device
  * Reconnect the event loop when mpd restarts. Before the fix,
    events stopped being generated after mpd restarted
  * Radio metadata issues fixed
  * Media Server: Deezer streaming service plugin
  * Fix events not working when mpd had password set

-------------------------------------------------------------------

    (>60S, play transition started from other client was not detected)
  * Fix ohinfo issue resulting in no cover art display in Kazoo "currently playing" screen.
  * Fix a number of issues in radio metadata.
  * The minimum effective volume adjustment was 5. Reset it to 1.
  * Cache update issues in OH playlist resulted in incomplete metadata.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec  9 13:56:21 UTC 2020 - Michael Pujos <pujos.michael@gmail.com>

- update to 1.5.5:
  * Fix issue with removing tracks from the playlist (sometimes slow or freezed).
  * Fix bad locking causing multiple execs of radio scripts.
  * Setting lumincompat = 1 is not useful any more and crashes some Kazoo versions.
    So you should keep the default value which is off.
  * Improve metadata processing when playing radios with BubbleDS.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov 25 12:31:40 UTC 2020 - Michael Pujos <pujos.michael@gmail.com>
