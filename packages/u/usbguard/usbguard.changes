    the kernel is still enumerating the devices and send the
    uevent while the parent is being authorised
  + Silenced 'bind' and 'unbind' uevents
- Remove PEGTL build dependency, the package already uses the
  bundled version, and there is hardly any reason to unbundle
  a template (header only) library.

  via udev-mini.

    umockdev based device manager capable of simulating devices based on umockdev-record files.

- update to 0.7.2

  - Changed
    Qt Applet: disabled session management
    usbguard-daemon console logging output is enabled by default now.  Previously, the -k option had to be passed to enable the output.
    Replaced --enable-maintainer-mode configure option with --enable-full-test-suite option. When the new option is not used during the configure phase, only a basic set of test is run during the make check phase.
    usbguard-daemon now opens configuration in read-only mode

    If bash completion support is detected at configure time, install the bash completion script during make install.
    Added new configuration setting: IPCAccessControlFiles.
    IPC access is now configurable down to a section and privilege level per user and/or group.
    Added add-user, remove-user usbuard CLI subcommands for creating, removing IPC access control files.
    Added AuditFilePath configuration option for setting the location of the USBGuard audit events log file path. If set, the usbguard-daemon will log policy and device related actions and whether they succeeded or not.

  - Removed

    Removed UDev based device manager backend and UDev related dependencies.
    Removed UDev development files/API dependecy

  - Changed

    Reset Linux root hub bcdDevice value before updating device hash. This is a backwards incompatible change because it changes how the device hash is computed for Linux root hub devices.
    Refactored low-level USB device handling into SysFSDevice class which represents a device in the /sys filesystem (sysfs).
    Removed usage of readdir_r because it's obsolete. Replaced with readdir with the assumption that its usage is thread-safe if the directory handle passed to it is not shared between threads.
    Extended test suite with use case tests.
    Install the usbguard-daemon configuration and policy file with strict file permissions to prevent policy leaks.
    Fixed several memory leaks.
    Don't pre-resolve user and group names in IPCAllowedUsers and IPCAllowedGroups settings. Instead, resolve the name during the IPC authentication phase.
