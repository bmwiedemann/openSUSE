Fri Oct  2 15:12:06 UTC 2020 - pgajdos@suse.com

- drop useless build dependency on aspell (aspell is going to be
  removed from tumbleweed)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul  9 12:57:34 UTC 2020 - Robert Frohl <rfrohl@suse.com>

- disable system call filtering in systemd service file for Leap 15.X (boo#1173750)
  * daemon wont start on Leap otherwise

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun 16 11:40:03 UTC 2020 - Robert Frohl <rfrohl@suse.com>

- update to 0.7.8
  + Fixed segfaults with rules.d feature
- update to 0.7.7
  + Added readwritepath to service file
  + Added match-all keyword to rules language
  + Added rules.d feature: daemon can load multiple rule files from rules.d/
  + Included with-connect-type in dbus signal
  + Fixed sigwaitinfo handling
  + Fixed possible data corruption on stack with appendRule via dbus
  + Fixed ENOBUFS errno handling on netlink socket: daemon can survive and wait until socket is readable again
  + Dropped unused PIDFile from service file
  + Dropped deprecated dbus-glib dependency

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 30 18:26:34 UTC 2020 - Stefan Brüns <stefan.bruens@rwth-aachen.de>

- update to 0.7.6
  + Added missing options in manpage usbguard-daemon(8)
  + Extended the functionality of allow/block/reject commands
    The command can handle rule as a param and not only its ID e.g.
    in case of allow, command will allow each device that matches
    provided rule
  + Added debug info for malformed descriptors
  + Changed default backend to uevent
  + Fixed handling of add uevents during scanning
    Now we are sure that the enumeration is completed before
    processing any uevent we are trying to avoid a race where
    the kernel is still enumerating the devices and send the
    uevent while the parent is being authorised
  + Silenced 'bind' and 'unbind' uevents
- Remove PEGTL build dependency, the package already uses the
  bundled version, and there is hardly any reason to unbundle
  a template (header only) library.
- Remove Qt5 build dependencies, Qt applet is a separate package.
- Use pkgconfig(udev) instead of udev-devel to allow shortcut
  via udev-mini.

    Fixed conditional manual page generation & installation

- update to 0.7.3
  - Changed
    usbguard-daemon will now exit with an error if it fails to open a logging file or audit event file.
    Modified the present device enumeration algorithm to be more reliable.  Enumeration timeouts won't cause usbguard-daemon process to exit anymore.

  - Added
    umockdev based device manager capable of simulating devices based on umockdev-record files.

- update to 0.7.2
  - Changed
    Fixed memory leaks in usbguard::Hash class.
    Fixed file descriptor leaks in usbguard::SysFSDevice class.
    Skip audit backend logging when no backend was set.

    Added zsh completion & other scripts to the distribution tarball.

- update to 0.7.1
  - Added
    CLI: usbguard watch command now includes an -e <path> option to run an executable for every received event. Event data are passed to the executable via environment variables.
    usbguard-daemon: added "-K" option which can disable logging to console.
    Added zsh autocompletion support.
    usbguard-daemon: added "-f" option which enabled double-fork daemonization procedure.
    Added AuditBackend usbguard-daemon configuration option for selecting audit log backend.
    Linux Audit support via new LinuxAudit backend.
    Added missing RuleCondition.hpp header file to the public API headers.

  - Changed
    Qt Applet: disabled session management
    usbguard-daemon console logging output is enabled by default now.  Previously, the -k option had to be passed to enable the output.
    Replaced --enable-maintainer-mode configure option with --enable-full-test-suite option. When the new option is not used during the configure phase, only a basic set of test is run during the make check phase.
    usbguard-daemon now opens configuration in read-only mode
    Fixed UEventDeviceManager to work with Linux Kernel >= 4.13
    Refactored audit logging to support different audit log backends

Wed Sep  6 10:48:23 UTC 2017 - meissner@suse.com

- updated to 0.7.0
  - Added
    Added InsertedDevicePolicy configuration option to control the policy method for inserted devices.
    Added RestoreControllerDeviceState configuration option.
    Added DeviceManagerBackend configuration option. This option can be used to select from several device manager backend implementations.
    Implemented an uevent based device manager backend.
    Added setParameter, getParameter IPC (incl. D-Bus) methods.
    Added set-parameter, get-parameter CLI subcommands.
    Qt Applet: Added Spanish (es_AR) translation.
    Create empty rules.conf file at install time (make install).
    Support for numeric UID/GID values in IPCAllowedUsers and IPCAllowedGroups settings.
    If bash completion support is detected at configure time, install the bash completion script during make install.
    Added new configuration setting: IPCAccessControlFiles.
    IPC access is now configurable down to a section and privilege level per user and/or group.
    Added add-user, remove-user usbuard CLI subcommands for creating, removing IPC access control files.
    Added AuditFilePath configuration option for setting the location of the USBGuard audit events log file path. If set, the usbguard-daemon will log policy and device related actions and whether they succeeded or not.

  - Removed

    Removed UDev based device manager backend and UDev related dependencies.
    Removed UDev development files/API dependecy

  - Changed

    Reset Linux root hub bcdDevice value before updating device hash. This is a backwards incompatible change because it changes how the device hash is computed for Linux root hub devices.
    Refactored low-level USB device handling into SysFSDevice class which represents a device in the /sys filesystem (sysfs).
    Removed usage of readdir_r because it's obsolete. Replaced with readdir with the assumption that its usage is thread-safe if the directory handle passed to it is not shared between threads.
    Extended test suite with use case tests.
    Install the usbguard-daemon configuration and policy file with strict file permissions to prevent policy leaks.
    Fixed several memory leaks.
    Don't pre-resolve user and group names in IPCAllowedUsers and IPCAllowedGroups settings. Instead, resolve the name during the IPC authentication phase.

    The libatomic emulation library will be used in such cases.
    Fixed several typos in the documentation

  - Added

    Implemented a simple internal logger
    Access to the logger via public API
    Improved logging coverage. Logging output can be enabled either via
    CLI options or by setting the USBGUARD_DEBUG environment variable to 1.
    Qt Applet: UI translation support.
    Qt Applet: Czech (cs_CZ) translation

  - Removed

    Removed spdlog dependency
