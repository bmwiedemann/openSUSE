  <title>A mode switching tool for controlling multiple-device USB gear</title>
  <description>USB_ModeSwitch is a mode switching tool for controlling &quot;flip flop&quot;
(multiple device) USB gear. It allows so-called &quot;Zero-CD&quot; devices that
show up as USB storage initially to be switched into their more useful
&quot;application mode&quot;. This is most common for UMTS/3G wireless WAN
devices.</description>
