  <title>Removes ifdefs from C files</title>
  <description>Unifdef is useful for removing ifdef'ed lines from a file while
otherwise leaving the file alone.  Unifdef acts on #ifdef, #ifndef,
#else, and #endif lines, and it knows only enough about C to know when
one of these is inactive because it is inside a comment, or a single or
double quote.</description>
