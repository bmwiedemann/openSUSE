%description
Unifdef is useful for removing ifdef'ed lines from a file while otherwise
leaving the file alone.  Unifdef acts on #ifdef, #ifndef, #else, and #endif
lines, and it knows only enough about C to know when one of these is
inactive because it is inside a comment, or a single or double quote.
