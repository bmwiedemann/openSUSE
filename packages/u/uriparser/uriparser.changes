- Update to 1.0.0 (bsc#1255000, CVE-2025-67899)
  * Fixed: [CVE-2025-67899]
      Protect from stack overflow during parsing by dissolving all 13 cases
      of recursion, both direct and indirect. The attack vector was long
      (or crafted) URI input. The known impact is denial of service or more.
      Thanks for the report to Sergey Svistunov!
      Thanks for in-depth review to Tim Düsterhus! (sponsored by Tideways GmbH)
      Thanks for C callgraph tool "egypt" (https://www.gson.org/egypt/)
        to Andreas Gustafsson and for "dot_find_cycles.py" to Jason Antman!
  * Changed: Start requiring a C99 compiler (GitHub #264, GitHub #273)
  * Changed: Require CMake >=3.15.0 (GitHub #270)
  * Fixed: Normalization of URIs with leading dot segments
      produced ambiguous results in the sense that a reparse
      after normalization would have misinterpreted path parts
      as a host (GitHub #262, GitHub #263, GitHub #265)
      Examples of affected URIs:
      - "scheme:/.//path1/path2"
      - "/.//path1/path2"
      - ".//path1/path2"
      The fix is to not remove that dot segment.
      Thanks to Ignace Nyamagana Butera and to Tim Düsterhus for the report!
  * Fixed: Insufficient pointer alignment from allocation wrappers
      used in the implementation of function uriCompleteMemoryManager.
      (GitHub #261)
      Thanks to Matthew Fernandez and Rolf Eike Beer for the report and review!
  * Fixed: Do not set `absolutePath` for empty paths when removing host

      Old: -DURIPARSER_MSVC_RUNTIME=/MT

      with CMake >=3.5 (GitHub #261)

  * Fixed: Compiler warnings (GitHub #132, GitHub #152)
  * Improved: Use name UriConfig.h rather than generic config.h for the
      config header file to avoid name clashes and also include it through
      "UriConfig.h" with quotes rather than <UriConfig.h> so that it is found
      in quote path locations (GitHub #149)

  ghostscript-fonts-std for the fonts used

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jan  9 20:48:18 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 0.9.6 (bsc#1194365, bsc#1194364):
  * Fixed: [CVE-2021-46141]
      Fix a bug affecting both uriNormalizeSyntax* and uriMakeOwner*
      functions where the text range in .hostText would not be duped using
      malloc but remain unchanged (and hence "not owned") for URIs with
      an IPv4 or IPv6 address hostname; depending on how an application
      uses uriparser, this could lead the application into a use-after-free
      situation.
      As the second half, fix uriFreeUriMembers* functions that would not
      free .hostText memory for URIs with an IPv4 or IPv6 address host;
      also, calling uriFreeUriMembers* multiple times on a URI of this
      very nature would result in trying to free pointers to stack
      (rather than heap) memory (GitHub #121, GitHub #124)
      Commit 987b046e41f407d17c622e580fc82a5e834b4329
      Commit b1a34743bc1472e055d886e29e9b53f670eb3282
  * Fixed: [CVE-2021-46142]
      Fix functions uriNormalizeSyntax* for out-of-memory situations
      (i.e. malloc returning NULL) for URIs containing empty segments
      (any of user info, host text, query, or fragment) where previously
      pointers to stack (rather than heap) memory were freed (GitHub #122,
      GitHub #124)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun May 16 17:55:31 UTC 2021 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 0.9.5:
  * Fixed: Fix a bug regarding section "5.2.4. Remove Dot Segments"
      of RFC 3986 that affected both normalization and reference resolution
      with regard to trailing slashes (GitHub #92, #97)
      Thanks to Dan Pape for the report!

      Thanks for the patch to Shehzan Mohammed!
  * Fixed: Addressed MSVC compile warning about lack of /EHsc when compiling
      the C++ test suite code (GitHub #102)
  * Fixed: Stopped misadvertising wide characters as Unicode support
      (GitHub #104)
  * Added: CMake option URIPARSER_WARNINGS_AS_ERRORS=(ON|OFF)
      to turn compile warnings into errors, defaults to "OFF" (GitHub #102)
  * Improved: pkg-config: Use ${prefix} and ${exec_prefix} to ease
      overriding variables using --define-variable=NAME=VALUE,
      e.g. as done on OpenWRT (GitHub #91)
      Thanks to Karel Kočí for the pull request!
  * Improved: Auto-detection of the qhelpgenerator command based on CMake
      package "Qt5Help" when available.  CMake option "QHG_LOCATION" can still
      be used to enforce a specific location (GitHub #103)
      Thanks for his help to Andreas Sturmlechner!
  * Improved: Make documentation use pkg-config in example on how to
      check for uriparser from within configure.ac (GNU Autoconf)
      (GitHub #37, #106)
  * Improved: In testing code, add a missing 'extern "C"' (GitHub #109)

    the original URI string (GitHub #77 and #78)
    New functions:
      uriMakeOwner[AW]
      uriMakeOwnerMm[AW]

Wed Jan 16 14:00:52 UTC 2019 - adam.majer@suse.de

- Update to version 0.9.1
  * Fixed Out-of-bounds read in uriParse*Ex* for incomplete URIs
    with IPv6 addresses with embedded IPv4 address, e.g. "//[::44.1"
    mitigated if passed parameter <afterLast> points to readable
    memory containing a '\0' byte. (bsc#1122193, CVE-2018-20721)
  * Fixed: When parsing a malformed URI with an IPvFuture address
    (e.g. "http://[vA.123456" missing "]"), errorPos would point
    to the first character after "v" than the actual position of the
    error (here: the end of the string)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr  9 14:42:24 UTC 2010 - davejplater@gmail.com

- Update to version 0.7.5 fixed doxygen build with uriparser-0.7.5-doxygen.patch
- Upstream changes :-
  * Added: pkg-config file
  * Fixed: File Doxyfile.in was missing from release archives
      Thanks to Rakesh Pandit for reporting!
  * Fixed: Doc generation troubles
  * Changed: No longer shipping bundled libcpptest
  * Changed: New dependencies:
      - libcpptest 1.1.0 or later
      - pkg-config (for libcpptest detection)
      Both dependencies can be disable through configuring
      with --disable-test, which excludes the test suite

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep  2 11:11:06 CEST 2008 - crrodriguez@suse.de

- update to version 0.7.2
	 Fixed: Bad cleanup logic in functions
   	  uriAddBaseUri(..)
      uriRemoveBaseUri(..)
    Previously you needed to call uriFreeUriMembers on return code
    URI_ERROR_MALLOC and only then. So that's why these functions now
    take cleanup off your shoulders. An extra call to uriFreeUriMembers
    from your side is still needed in case of success.

	* Fixed: Parser did not handle trailing slashes correctly in some cases,
    which also made the structures produced from parsing "http://e.com/"
    and "http://e.com" indistinguishable. (#1950126)
    Thanks to Edward Z. Yang for reporting!
