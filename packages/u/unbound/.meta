  <title>Validating, recursive, and caching DNS(SEC) resolver</title>
  <description>Unbound is a validating, recursive, and caching DNS(SEC) resolver.

The C implementation of Unbound is developed and maintained by NLnet
Labs. It is based on ideas and algorithms taken from a java prototype
developed by Verisign labs, Nominet, Kirei and ep.net.

Unbound is designed as a set of modular components, so that also
DNSSEC (secure DNS) validation and stub-resolvers (that do not run
as a server, but are linked into an application) are easily possible.

This package is just for my personal use. If you want to submit it to factory you become the maintainer.
