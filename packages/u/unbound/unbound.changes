Thu Dec 12 21:01:07 UTC 2019 - Michael Ströder <michael@stroeder.com>

- update to 1.9.6
  This release contains a number of security related fixes found in
  a security audit

Features:
- The unbound.conf includes are sorted ascending, for include
  statements with a '*' from glob.
- drop-tld.diff in contrib/ : adds option drop-tld: yesno that drops 2 label
  queries, to stop random floods.  Apply with
  patch -p1 < contrib/drop-tld.diff and compile.
  From Saksham Manchanda (Secure64).  Please note that we think this
  will drop DNSKEY and DS lookups for tlds and hence break DNSSEC
  lookups for downstream clients.
- Add new configure option `--enable-fully-static` to enable full static
  build if requested; in relation to #91.
- Add make distclean that removes everything configure produced,
  and make maintainer-clean that removes bison and flex output.
- unbound-fuzzers.tar.bz2 in contrib/ : three programs for fuzzing, that
  are 1:1 replacements for unbound-fuzzme.c that gets created after applying
  the contrib/unbound-fuzzme.patch.  They are contributed by
  Eric Sesterhenn from X41 D-Sec.

Bug Fixes:
- Fix that pkg-config is setup before --enable-systemd needs it.

  on low verbosity, they show on verbosity 3 (query details), because
  there is a high volume and the operator cannot do anything for the
  remote failure.  Specifically filters the high volume errors.
- Fix #71: fix openssl error squelch commit compilation error.
- Fix #72: configure --with-syslog-facility=LOCAL0-7 with default
  LOG_DAEMON (as before) can set the syslog facility that the server
  uses to log messages.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug 27 18:33:04 UTC 2019 - Michael Ströder <michael@stroeder.com>

- update to 1.9.3

Features:
- PR #28: IPSet module, by Kevin Chou.  Created a module to support
  the ipset that could add the domain's ip to a list easily.
  Needs libmnl, and --enable-ipset and config it, doc/README.ipset.md.
- Merge PR #6: Python module: support multiple instances
- Merge PR #5: Python module: define constant MODULE_RESTART_NEXT
- Merge PR #4: Python module: assign something useful to the
  per-query data store 'qdata'
- Introduce `-V` option to print the version number and build options.
  Previously reported build options like linked libs and linked modules
  are now moved from `-h` to `-V` as well for consistency.
- PACKAGE_BUGREPORT now also includes link to GitHub issues.

Bug Fixes:
- Fix #39: In libunbound, leftover logfile is close()d unpredictably.
- Fix for #24: Fix abort due to scan of auth zone masters using old
  address from previous scan.
- Fix to omit RRSIGs from addition to the ipset.
- Fix to make unbound-control with ipset, remove unused variable,
  use unsigned type because of comparison, and assign null instead
  of compare with it.  Remade lex and yacc output.
- make depend
- Added documentation to the ipset files (for doxygen output).
- Fix python dict reference and double free in config.
- Fix memleak in unit test, reported from the clang 8.0 static analyzer.
- For #45, check that 127.0.0.1 and ::1 are not used in unbound.conf
  when do-not-query-localhost is turned on, or at default on,
  unbound-checkconf prints a warning if it is found in forward-addr or
  stub-addr statements.
- Fix for possible assertion failure when answering respip CNAME from
  cache.
- Fix in respip addrtree selection. Absence of addr_tree_init_parents()
  call made it impossible to go up the tree when the matching netmask is
  too specific.
- Fix #48: Unbound returns additional records on NODATA response,
  if minimal-responses is enabled, also the additional for negative
  responses is removed.
- Fix #49: Set no renegotiation on the SSL context to stop client
  session renegotiation.
- Fix question section mismatch in local zone redirect.
- Add verbose log message when auth zone file is written, at level 4.
- Add hex print of trust anchor pointer to trust anchor file temp
  name to make it unique, for libunbound created multiple contexts.
- For #52 #53, second context does not close logfile override.
- Fix #52 #53, fix for example fail program.
- Fix to return after failed auth zone http chunk write.
- Fix to remove unused test for task_probe existance.
- Fix to timeval_add for remaining second in microseconds.
- Check repinfo in worker_handle_request, if null, drop it.
- Generate configlexer with newer flex.
- Fix warning for unused variable for compilation without systemd.
- Fix #59, when compiled with systemd support check that we can properly
  communicate with systemd through the `NOTIFY_SOCKET`.
- iana portlist updated.
- Fix autotrust temp file uniqueness windows compile.
- avoid warning about upcast on 32bit systems for autotrust.
- escape commandline contents for -V.
- Fix character buffer size in ub_ctx_hosts.
- Option -V prints if TCP fastopen is available.
- Fix unittest valgrind false positive uninitialised value report,
  where if gcc 9.1.1 uses -O2 (but not -O1) then valgrind 3.15.0
  issues an uninitialised value for the token buffer at the str2wire.c
  rrinternal_get_owner() strcmp with the '@' value.  Rewritten to use
  straight character comparisons removes the false positive.  Also
  valgrinds --expensive-definedness-checks=yes can stop this false
  positive.
- Please doxygen's parser for "@" occurrence in doxygen comment.
- Fixup contrib/fastrpz.patch
- Remove warning about unknown cast-function-type warning pragma.
- Document limitation of pidfile removal outside of chroot directory.
- Fix log_dns_msg to log irrespective of minimal responses config.
- Fix that pkg-config is setup before --enable-systemd needs it.

- Fix #29: Solaris 11.3 and missing symbols be64toh, htobe64.
- Fix #30: AddressSanitizer finding in lookup3.c.  This sets the
  hash function to use a slower but better auditable code that does
  not read beyond array boundaries.  This makes code better security
  checkable, and is better for security.  It is fixed to be slower,
  but not read outside of the array.
- Fix edns-subnet locks, in error cases the lock was not unlocked.

Mon Oct  8 13:42:15 UTC 2018 - Michael Ströder <michael@stroeder.com>

- update to 1.8.1:
  Number of bug fixes, a list of features added and some defaults changed.

Features:
  - Perform TLS SNI indication of the host that is being contacted
    for DNS over TLS service.  It sets the configured tls auth name.
    This is useful for hosts that apart from the DNS over TLS services
    also provide other (web) services.
Bug Fixes:
  - More explicitly mention the type of ratelimit when applying
    ip-ratelimit.
  - Fix spelling error in header, from getdns commit by Andreas Gelmini.
  - iana port update.
  - Fixed unused return value warnings in contrib/fastrpz.patch for
    asprintf.
  - Fix to squelch respip warning in unit test, it is printed at
    higher verbosity settings.
  - Fix spelling errors.
  - Fix initialisation in remote.c
  - Fix seed for random backup code to use explicit zero when wiped.
  - exit log routine is annotated as noreturn function.
  - free memory leaks in config strlist and str2list insert functions.
  - do not move unused argv variable after getopt.
  - Remove unused if clause in testcode.
  - in testcode, free async ids, initialise array, and check for null
    pointer during test of the test.  And use exit for return to note
    irregular program stop.
  - Free memory leak in config strlist append.
  - make sure nsec3 comparison salt is initialized.
  - unit test has clang analysis.
  - remove unused variable assignment from iterator scrub routine.
  - check for null in delegation point during iterator refetch
    in forward zone.
  - neater pointer cast in libunbound context quit routine.
  - initialize statistics totals for printout.
  - in authzone check that node exists before adding rrset.
  - in unbound-anchor, use readwrite memory BIO.
  - assertion in autotrust that packed rrset is formed correctly.
  - Fix memory leak when message parse fails partway through copy.
  - remove unused udpsize assignment in message encode.
  - nicer bio free code in unbound-anchor.
  - annotate exit functions with noreturn in unbound-control.
  - Fix compile on Mac for unbound, provide explicit_bzero when libc
    does not have it.
  - Fix unbound for openssl in FIPS mode, it uses the digests with
    the EVP call contexts.
  - Fix that with harden-below-nxdomain and qname minisation enabled
    some iterator states for nonresponsive domains can get into a
    state where they waited for an empty list.
  - Stop UDP to TCP failover after timeouts that causes the ping count
    to be reset by the TCP time measurement (that exists for TLS),
    because that causes the UDP part to not be measured as timeout.
  - Fix #4156: Fix systemd service manager state change notification.
  - Fix #4149: Add SSL cleanup for tcp timeout.
  - Fix #4188: IPv6 forwarders without ipv6 result in SERVFAIL, fixes

    from rejecting responses.
  - fastrpz.patch fixed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 17 17:00:00 UTC 2018 - michael@stroeder.com

- update to 1.8.0:
  Number of bug fixes, a list of features added and some defaults changed.

Features
- unbound-control auth_zone_reload _zone_ option rereads the zonefile.
- unbound-control auth_zone_transfer _zone_ option starts the probe
  sequence for a master to transfer the zone from and transfers when
  a new zone version is available.
- num.queries.tls counter for queries over TLS.
- log port number with err_addr logs.
- dns64-ignore-aaaa: config option to list domain names for which the
  existing AAAA is ignored and dns64 processing is used on the A
  record.
- Fix #4112: Fix that unbound-anchor -f /etc/resolv.conf will not pass
  if DNSSEC is not enabled.  New option -R allows fallback from
  resolv.conf to direct queries.
- Note RFC8162 support.  SMIMEA record type can be read in by the
  zone record parser.
- Patches from Jim Hague (Sinodun) for EDNS KeepAlive.
- Add config tcp-idle-timeout (default 30s). This applies to
  client connections only; the timeout on TCP connections upstream
  is unaffected.
- Add edns-tcp-keepalive and edns-tcp-keepalive timeout options
  and implement option in client responses.
- Add delay parameter to streamtcp, -d secs.
  To be used when testing idle timeout.
- Expose if a query (or a subquery) was ratelimited (not src IP
  ratelimiting) to libunbound under 'ub_result.was_ratelimited'.
  This also introduces a change to 'ub_event_callback_type' in
  libunbound/unbound-event.h.
- Patch to implement tcp-connection-limit from Jim Hague (Sinodun).
  This limits the number of simultaneous TCP client connections
  from a nominated netblock.
- Fix #4142: unbound.service.in: improvements and fixes.
  Add unit dependency ordering (based on systemd-resolved).
  Add 'CAP_SYS_RESOURCE' to 'CapabilityBoundingSet' (fixes warnings
  about missing privileges during startup). Add 'AF_INET6' to
  'RestrictAddressFamilies' (without it IPV6 can't work). From
  Guido Shanahan.
- unbound-checkconf checks if modules exist and prints if they are
  not compiled in the name of the wrong module.
- Patch for stub-no-cache and forward-no-cache options that disable
  caching for the contents of that stub or forward, for when you
  want immediate changes visible, from Bjoern A. Zeeb.
- Upgraded crosscompile script to include libunbound DLL in the
  zipfile.
- Set libunbound to increase current, because the libunbound change
  to the event callback function signature.  That needs programs,
  that use it, to recompile against the new header definition.
- log-servfail: yes prints log lines that say why queries are
  returning SERVFAIL to clients.
- log-local-actions: yes option for unbound.conf that logs all the
  local zone actions, a patch from Saksham Manchanda (Secure64).
- #4146: num.query.subnet and num.query.subnet_cache counters.
- #4140: Expose repinfo (comm_reply) to the inplace_callbacks. This
  gives access to reply information for the client's communication
  point when the callback is called before the mesh state (modules).
  Changes to C and Python's inplace_callback signatures were also
  necessary.
- Set defaults to yes for a number of options to increase speed and
  resilience of the server.  The so-reuseport, harden-below-nxdomain,
  and minimal-responses options are enabled by default.  They used
  to be disabled by default, waiting to make sure they worked.  They
  are enabled by default now, and can be disabled explicitly by
  setting them to "no" in the unbound.conf config file.  The reuseport
  and minimal options increases speed of the server, and should be
  otherwise harmless.  The harden-below-nxdomain option works well
  together with the recently default enabled qname minimisation, this
  causes more fetches to use information from the cache.
- Added serve-expired-ttl and serve-expired-ttl-reset options.

Bug Fixes
- Windows example service.conf edited with more windows specific
  configuration.
- #4108: systemd reload hang fix.
- Fix usage printout for unbound-host, hostname has to be last

- Fix #4130: print text describing -dd and unbound-checkconf on
  config file read error at startup, the errors may have been moved
  away by the startup process.

Thu Jun 21 09:19:02 UTC 2018 - michael@stroeder.com

- update to 1.7.3

Features
- #4102 for NSD, but for Unbound.  Named unix pipes do not use
  certificate and key files, access can be restricted with file and
  directory permissions.  The option control-use-cert is no longer
  used, and ignored if found in unbound.conf.
- Rename tls-additional-ports to tls-additional-port, because every
  line adds one port.

Bug Fixes
- Don't count CNAME response types received during qname minimisation
  as query restart.
- #4100: Fix stub reprime when it becomes useless.
- Fix crash if ratelimit taken into use with unbound-control
  instead of with unbound.conf.
- Patch to fix openwrt for mac os build darwin detection in configure.
- #4103: Fix that auth-zone does not insist on SOA record first in
  file for url downloads.

  knowledge and will be used by other software packages

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May  3 16:38:07 UTC 2018 - michael@stroeder.com

- update to 1.7.1

Features
- Add --with-libhiredis, unbound support for a new cachedb
  backend that uses a Redis server as the storage.  This
  implementation depends on the hiredis client library
  (https://redislabs.com/lp/hiredis/).
  And unbound should be built with both --enable-cachedb and
  --with-libhiredis[=PATH] (where $PATH/include/hiredis/hiredis.h
  should exist).  Patch from Jinmei Tatuya (Infoblox).
- Create additional tls service interfaces by opening them on other
  portnumbers and listing the portnumbers as additional-tls-port: nr.
- ED448 support.
- num.query.authzone.up and num.query.authzone.down statistics counters.
- Accept both option names with and without colon for get_option
  and set_option.
- low-rtt and low-rtt-pct in unbound.conf enable the server selection
  of fast servers for some percentage of the time.
- num.query.aggressive.NOERROR and num.query.aggressive.NXDOMAIN
  statistics counters.
- allow-notify: config statement for auth-zones.
- Can set tls authentication with forward-addr: IP#tls.auth.name
  And put the public cert bundle in tls-cert-bundle: "ca-bundle.pem".
  such as forward-addr: 9.9.9.9@853#dns.quad9.net or
  1.1.1.1@853#cloudflare-dns.com
- list_auth_zones unbound-control command.
- Added root-key-sentinel support

- Check "result" in dup_all(), by Florian Obser.
- Fix #4043: make test fails due to v6 presentation issue in macOS.
- Fix unable to resolve after new WLAN connection, due to auth-zone
  failing with a forwarder set.  Now, auth-zone is only used for
  answers (not referrals) when a forwarder is set.
- Combine write of tcp length and tcp query for dns over tls.
- nitpick fixes in example.conf.
- Fix above stub queries for type NS and useless delegation point.
- Fix unbound-control over pipe with openssl 1.1.1, the TLSv1.3
  tls_choose_sigalg routine does not allow the ciphers for the pipe,
  so use TLSv1.2.
- Fix that flush_zone sets prefetch ttl expired, so that with
  serve-expired enabled it'll start prefetching those entries.
- Fix downstream auth zone, only fallback when auth zone fails to
  answer and fallback is enabled.
- Fix for max include depth for authzones.
- Fix memory free on fail for $INCLUDE in authzone.
- Fix that an internal error to look up the wrong rr type for
  auth zone gets stopped, before trying to send there.

  verify the server's certificate (RFC 8310 support).
- For addr with #authname and no @port notation, the default is 853.
- man page documentation for dns-over-tls forward-addr '#' notation.
- removed free from failed parse case.
- Fix #4091: Fix that reload of auth-zone does not merge the zonefile
  with the previous contents.

Sun Apr 22 19:26:03 UTC 2018 - michael@stroeder.com

- Commented configuration directive dlv-anchor-file: in unbound.conf
  (see bsc#1055060). The DLV key file is deliberately still
  shipped in the package so users could easily re-enable this.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr  4 11:54:01 UTC 2018 - michael@stroeder.com

- update to 1.7.0

Features
- auth-zone provides a way to configure RFC7706 from unbound.conf,
  eg. with auth-zone: name: "." for-downstream: no for-upstream: yes
  fallback-enabled: yes and masters or a zonefile with data.
- Aggressive use of NSEC implementation. Use cached NSEC records to
  generate NXDOMAIN, NODATA and positive wildcard answers.
- Accept tls-upstream in unbound.conf, the ssl-upstream keyword is
  also recognized and means the same.  Also for tls-port,
  tls-service-key, tls-service-pem, stub-tls-upstream and
  forward-tls-upstream.
- [dnscrypt] introduce dnscrypt-provider-cert-rotated option,
  from Manu Bretelle.
  This option allows handling multiple cert/key pairs while only
  distributing some of them.
  In order to reliably match a client magic with a given key without
  strong assumption as to how those were generated, we need both key and
  cert. Likewise, in order to know which ES version should be used.
  On the other hand, when rotating a cert, it can be desirable to only
  serve the new cert but still be able to handle clients that are still
  using the old certs's public key.
  The `dnscrypt-provider-cert-rotated` allow to instruct unbound to not
  publish the cert as part of the DNS's provider_name's TXT answer.
- Update B root ipv4 address.
- make ip-transparent option work on OpenBSD.
- Fix #2801: Install libunbound.pc.

- update to 1.6.1

Features
  * configure --enable-systemd and lets unbound use systemd sockets if you

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec 15 16:28:44 UTC 2016 - michael@stroeder.com

- update to 1.6.0

Features
  * Added generic EDNS code for registering known EDNS option codes,
    bypassing the cache response stage and uniquifying mesh states. Four
    EDNS option lists were added to module_qstate
    (module_qstate.edns_opts_*) to store EDNS options from/to front/back side.
  * Added two flags to module_qstate (no_cache_lookup, no_cache_store)
    that control the modules' cache interactions.
  * Added code for registering inplace callback functions. The registered
    functions can be called just before replying with local data or Chaos,
    replying from cache, replying with SERVFAIL, replying with a resolved
    query, sending a query to a nameserver. The functions can inspect the
    available data and maybe change response/query related data (i.e. append
    EDNS options).
  * Updated Python module for the above.
  * Updated Python documentation.
  * Added views functionality.
  * Added qname-minimisation-strict config option.
  * Patch that resolves CNAMEs entered in local-data conf statements that
    point to data on the internet, from Jinmei Tatuya (Infoblox).
  * serve-expired config option: serve expired responses with TTL 0.
  * .gitattributes line for githubs code language display.
  * log-identity: config option to set sys log identity, patch from "Robin
    H. Johnson" (robbat2@gentoo.org).
  * Added stub-ssl-upstream and forward-ssl-upstream options.
  * Added local-zones and local-data bulk addition and removal
    functionality in unbound-control (local_zones, local_zones_remove,
    local_datas and local_datas_remove).
  * g.root-servers.net has AAAA address.

  Bug Fixes
  * Fix #836: unbound could echo back EDNS options in an error response.
  * Fix #838: 1.5.10 cannot be built on Solaris, undefined PATH_MAX.
  * Fix #839: Memory grows unexpectedly with large RPZ files.
  * Fix #840: infinite loop in unbound_munin_ plugin on unowned lockfile.
  * Fix #841: big local-zone's make it consume large amounts of memory.
  * Fix dnstap relaying "random" messages instead of resolver/forwarder
    responses, from Nikolay Edigaryev.
  * Fix Nits for 1.5.10 reported by Dag-Erling Smorgrav.
  * Fix #1117: spelling errors, from Robert Edmonds.
  * iana portlist update.
  * fix memoryleak logfile when in debug mode.
  * Re-fix #839 from view commit overwrite.
  * Fixup const void cast warning.
  * Removed patch comments from acllist.c and msgencode.c
  * Added documentation doc/CNAME-basedRedirectionDesignNotes.pdf, from
    Jinmei Tatuya (Infoblox).
  * Fix #1125: unbound could reuse an answer packet incorrectly for
    clients with different EDNS parameters, from Jinmei Tatuya.
  * Fix #1118: libunbound.pc sets strange Libs, Libs.private values.
  * Added Requires line to libunbound.pc
  * Fix #1130: whitespace in example.conf.in more consistent.
  * suppress compile warning in lex files.
  * init lzt variable, for older gcc compiler warnings.
  * fix --enable-dsa to work, instead of copying ecdsa enable.
  * Fix DNSSEC validation of query type ANY with DNAME answers.
  * Fixup query_info local_alias init.
  * Ported tests for local_cname unit test to testbound framework.
  * Fix #1134: unbound-control set_option -- val-override-date: -1 works
    immediately to ignore datetime, or back to 0 to enable it again. The --
    is to ignore the '-1' as an option flag.
  * Patch for server.num.zero_ttl stats for count of expired replies, from
    Pavel Odintsov.
  * Fix failure to build on arm64 with no sbrk.
  * Set OpenSSL security level to 0 when using aNULL ciphers.
  * configure detects ssl security level API function in the autoconf
    manner. Every function on its own, so that other libraries (eg.
    LibreSSL) can develop their API without hindrance.
  * Fix #1154: segfault when reading config with duplicate zones.
  * Note that for harden-below-nxdomain the nxdomain must be secure, this
    means nsec3 with optout is insufficient.
  * Fix #1155: test status code of unbound-control in 04-checkconf, not
    the status code from the tee command.
  * Fix #1158: reference RFC 8020 "NXDOMAIN: There Really Is Nothing
    Underneath" for the harden-below-nxdomain option.
  * patch from Dag-Erling Smorgrav that removes code that relies on sbrk().
  * Make access-control-tag-data RDATA absolute. This makes the RDATA
    origin consistent between local-data and access-control-tag-data.
  * Fix NSEC ENT wildcard check. Matching wildcard does not have to be a
    subdomain of the NSEC owner.
  * QNAME minimisation uses QTYPE=A, therefore always check cache for this
    type in harden-below-nxdomain functionality.
  * Added unit test for QNAME minimisation + harden below nxdomain synergy.
  * Fix that with openssl 1.1 control-use-cert: no uses less cpu, by using
    no encryption over the unix socket.
  * hyphen as minus fix, by Andreas Schulze
  * Fix #1170: document that 'inform' local-zone uses local-data.
  * Fix #1173: differ local-zone type deny from unset tag_actions element.
  * Add DSA support for OpenSSL 1.1.0
  * Fix remote control without cert for LibreSSL
  * Fix downcast warnings from visual studio in sldns code.

Thu Oct 15 19:31:43 UTC 2015 - michael@stroeder.com

- update to 1.5.6
  Features
  - Default for ssl-port is port 853, the temporary port assignment for
    secure domain name system traffic. If you used to rely on the older
    default of port 443, you have to put a clause in unbound.conf for
    that. The new value is likely going to be the standardised port number
    for this traffic.
  - ANY responses include DNAME records if present, as per Evan Hunt's
    remark in dnsop.

  Bug Fixes
  - Fix segfault in the dns64 module in the formaterror error path.
  - Fix manpage to suggest using SIGTERM to terminate the server.
  - iana portlist update.

    certificates. (thanks Daniel Kahn Gillmor)
  - Enable ECDHE for servers. Where available, use
    SSL_CTX_set_ecdh_auto() for TLS-wrapped server configurations
    to enable ECDHE. Otherwise, manually offer curve p256. Client
    connections should automatically use ECDHE when available.
    (thanks Daniel Kahn Gillmor)

- enable dnstap support

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul  9 10:16:32 UTC 2015 - michael@stroeder.com

- update to 1.5.4

Features
  - [bugzilla: 644 ] harden-algo-downgrade option, if turned off,
    fixes the reported excessive validation failure when multiple
    algorithms are present. If set to 'no', it allows the weakest
    algorithm to validate the zone.
  - stats reports tcp usage, of incoming-num-tcp buffers.
  - contrib/unbound_smf22.tar.gz: Solaris SMF installation/removal
    scripts. Contributed by Yuri Voinov.
  - Add ip-transparent config option for bind to non-local addresses.
  - Synthesize ANY responses from cache. Does not search exhaustively,
    but MX,A,AAAA,SOA,NS also CNAME.
  - unbound-control list_insecure command shows the negative trust
    anchors currently configured, patch from Jelte Jansen.
  - ratelimit feature, ratelimit: 1000, can be used to turn it on. It
    ratelimits recursion effort per zone. For particular names you can
    configure exceptions in unbound.conf.
  - Ratelimit does not apply to prefetched queries, and
    ratelimit-factor is default 10. Repeated normal queries get resolved
    and with prefetch stay in the cache.
  - unbound-control ratelimit_list lists high rate domains.
  - caps-whitelist in unbound.conf allows whitelist of loadbalancers
    that cannot work with caps-for-id or its fallback.
  - RFC 7553 RR type URI support, is now enabled by default.
  - cache-max-negative-ttl config option, default 3600.
  - Add local-zone type inform_deny, that logs query and drops answer.

Bug Fixes
  - Unbound exits with a fatal error when the auto-trust-anchor-file
    fails to be writable. This is seconds after startup. You can load a
    readonly auto-trust-anchor-file with trust-anchor-file. The file has
    to be writable to notice the trust anchor change, without it, a trust
    anchor change will be unnoticed and the system will then become
    inoperable.
  - DLV is going to be decommissioned. Advice to stop using it, and
    put text in the example configuration and man page to that effect.
  - Patch from Brad Smith that syncs compat/getentropy_linux with
    OpenBSD's version (2015-03-04).
  - 0x20 fallback improved: servfail responses do not count as missing
    comparisons (except if all responses are errors), inability to find
    nameservers does not fail equality comparisons, many nameservers does
    not try to compare more than max-sent-count, parse failures start 0x20
    fallback procedure.
  - store caps_response with best response in case downgrade response
    happens to be the last one.
  - Document that incoming-num-tcp increase is good for large servers.
  - Fix lintian warning in unbound-checkconf man page (from Andreas
    Schulze).
  - Updated default keylength in unbound-control-setup to 3k.
  - Fixup compile on cygwin, more portable openssl thread id.
  - Use reallocarray for integer overflow protection, patch submitted
    by Loganaden Velvindron.
  - Fixed to add integer overflow checks on allocation (defense in depth).
  - Fix segfault on user not found at startup (from Maciej Soltysiak).
  - [bugzilla: 657 ] Fix that libunbound(3) recommends deprecated
    CRYPTO_set_id_callback.
  - If unknown trust anchor algorithm, and libressl is used, error
    message encourages upgrade of the libressl package.
  - rename ldns subdirectory to sldns to avoid name collision.
  - [bugzilla: 660 ] Fix interface-automatic broken in the presence of
    asymmetric routing.
  - Libunbound skips dos-line-endings from etc/hosts.
  - Fix crash in dnstap: Do not try to log TCP responses after timeout.
  - Fix that get_option for cache-sizes does not print double newline.
  - [bugzilla: 663 ] Fix that ssl handshake fails when using unix
    socket because dh size is too small.
  - [bugzilla: 664 ] libunbound python3 related fixes (from Tomas
    Hozza); Use print_function also for Python2. libunbound examples:
    produce sorted output. libunbound-Python: libldns is not used anymore.
    Fix issue with Python 3 mapping of FILE* using file_py3.i from ldns.
  - Fix leaked dns64prefix configuration string.
  - Removed contrib/unbound_unixsock.diff, because it has been
    integrated, use control-interface: /path in unbound.conf.
  - Change syntax of particular validator error to be easier for
    machine parse, swap rrset and ip adres info so it looks like:
    validation failure <www.example.nl. TXT IN>: signature crypto failed
    from 2001:DB8:7:bba4::53 for <*.example.nl. NSEC IN>
  - Fix that unparseable error responses are ratelimited.
  - SOA negative TTL is capped at minimumttl in its rdata section.
  - [bugzilla: 674 ] Do not free pointers given by getenv.
  - [bugzilla: 677 ] Fix CNAME corresponding to a DNAME was checked
    incorrectly and was therefore always synthesized (thanks to Valentin
    Dietrich). And fix DNAME responses from cache that failed internal
    chain test.
  - iana portlist update.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr 24 13:53:53 UTC 2015 - michael@stroeder.com

- update to 1.5.3
- Bug Fixes
    [bugzilla: 647 ]

    - local-zone: example.com inform makes unbound log a message
      with client IP for queries in that zone. Eg. for finding
      infected hosts.
    - patch from Stephane Lapie that adds to the python API, that
      exposes struct delegpt, and adds the find_delegation
      function.
    - Updated contrib warmup.cmd/sh to support two modes - load
      from pre-defined list of domains or (with filename as
      argument) load from user-specified list of domains, and
      updated contrib unbound_cache.sh/cmd to support
      loading/save/reload cache to/from default path or (with
      secondary argument) arbitrary path/filename, from Yuri
      Voinov.
    - patch for remote control over local sockets, from Dag-Erling
      Smorgrav, Ilya Bakulin. Use control-interface: /path/sock and
      control-use-cert: no.
    - unbound-checkconf -f prints chroot with pidfile path.
    - infra-cache-min-rtt patch from Florian Riehm, for expected
      long uplink roundtrip times.

    - patch from Stuart Henderson that fixes DESTDIR in
      unbound-control-setup for installs where config is not in the
      prefix location.
    - [bugzilla: 634 ] Fix #634: fix fail to start on Linux LTS
      3.14.X, ignores missing IP_MTU_DISCOVER OMIT option (fix from
      Remi Gacogne).
    - Patch from Philip Paeps to contrib/unbound_munin_ that uses
      type ABSOLUTE. Allows munin.conf: [idleserver.example.net]
      unbound_munin_hits.graph_period minute
    - Fix pyunbound ord call, portable for python 2 and 3.
    - Fix unintended use of gcc extension for incomplete enum

      unsigned NS record in authority section.
    - Fix scrubber with harden-glue turned off to reject NS (and
      other not-address) records.
    - iana portlist update.
    - [bugzilla: 643 ] Fix doc/example.conf.in: unnecessary

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec  8 16:12:23 UTC 2014 - mrueckert@suse.de

- update to 1.5.1 (boo# 908990)
  Features
  - Patch from Stephane Lapie for ASAHI Net that implements
    aaaa-filter, added to contrib/aaaa-filter-iterator.patch.
  Bug Fixes
  - Fix that CD flag disables DNS64 processing, returning the
    DNSSEC signed AAAA denial.
  - Fix compat/getentropy_win.c check if CryptGenRandom works and
    no immediate exit on windows.
  - Fix crash on multiple thread random usage on systems without
    arc4random.
  - Fix log at high verbosity and memory allocation failure.
  - Fix libunbound undefined symbol errors for main.
  - Patch from Robert Edmonds to build pyunbound python module
    differently. No versioninfo, with -shared and without $(LIBS).
  - Patch from Robert Edmonds fixes hyphens in unbound-anchor man
    page.
  - Removed 'increased limit open files' log message that is
    written to console. It is only written on verbosity 4 and
    higher. This keeps system bootup console cleaner.
  - Patch from James Raftery, always print stats for rcodes 0..5.
  - [bugzilla: 627 ] Fix SSL_CTX_load_verify_locations return code
    not properly checked.
  - Fix makefile for build from noexec source tree.
  - Add include to getentropy_linux.c, fixing debian build.
  - [bugzilla: 632 ] Fix that unbound fails to build on AArch64,
    protects getentropy compat code from calling sysctl if it is
    has been removed.
  - Fix CVE-2014-8602: denial of service by making resolver chase
    endless series of delegations.
- changes in 1.5.0
  Features
  - This release has DNS64, DNSTAP, better random numbers and
    ub_ctx_add_ta_autr(), num.query.tcpout=value, flush_negative,
    unblock-lan-zones conf.
  - C.ROOT-SERVERS.NET has an IPv6 address, and we updated the root
    hints (patch from Anand Buddhdev).
  - Patch from Hannes Frederic Sowa for Linux 3.15 fragmentation
    option for DNS fragmentation defense.
  - unbound-control stats prints num.query.tcpout with number of
    TCP outgoing queries made in the previous statistics interval.
  - Patch from Jeremie Courreges-Anglas to use arc4random_uniform
    if available on the OS, it gets entropy from the OS.
  - Add unbound-control flush_negative that flushed nxdomains,
    nodata, and errors from the cache. For dnssec-trigger and
    NetworkManager, fixes cases where network changes have
    localdata that was already negatively cached from the previous
    network.
  - Contrib windows scripts from Yuri Voinov added to src/contrib:
    create_unbound_ad_servers.cmd: enters anti-ad server lists.
    unbound_cache.cmd: saves and loads the cache. Also warmup.cmd
    (and .sh): warm up the DNS cache with your MRU domains.
  - Added unbound-control-setup.cmd from Yuri Voinov to the windows
    unbound distribution set. It requires openssl installed in
    %PATH%.
  - Implement draft-ietf-dnsop-rfc6598-rfc6303-01.
  - Feature, unblock-lan-zones: yesno that you can use to make
    unbound perform 10.0.0.0/8 and other reverse lookups normally,
    for use if unbound is running service for localhost on localhost.
  - unbound-host -D enabled dnssec and reads root trust anchor from
    the default root key file that was compiled in.
  - Add AAAA for B root server to default root hints.
  - unbound-control status reports if so-reuseport was successful.
  - so-reuseport is available on BSDs(such as FreeBSD 10) and OS/X.
  - arc4random in compat/ and getentropy, explicit_bzero, chacha
    for dependencies, from OpenBSD. arc4_lock and sha512 in compat.
    This makes arc4random available on all platforms, except when
    compiled with LIBNSS (it uses libNSS crypto random).
  - Patch from Dag-Erling Smorgrav that implements that: unbound
    -dd does not fork in the background and also logs to stderr.
  - DNS64 from Viagenie (BSD Licensed), written by Simon Perrault.
    Initial commit of the patch from the FreeBSD base (with its
    fixes). This adds a module (for module-config in unbound.conf)
    dns64 that performs DNS64 processing, see README.DNS64.
  - Patch add msg, rrset, infra and key cache sizes to stats
    command from Maciej Soltysiak.
  - DNSTAP support, with a patch from Farsight Security, written by
    Robert Edmonds. The --enable-dnstap needs libfstrm and
    protobuf-c. It is BSD licensed (see dnstap/dnstap.c). Also
    --with-libfstrm and --with-protobuf-c configure options.
  - type CDS and CDNSKEY types.
  - Updated the TCP_BACLOG from 5 to 256, so that the tcp accept
    queue is longer and more tcp connections can be handled.
  - Add ub_ctx_add_ta_autr function to add a RFC5011 automatically
    tracked trust anchor to libunbound.
  Bug Fixes
  - Fix print filename of encompassing config file on read failure.
  - Patch from Stuart Henderson to build unbound-host man from
    .1.in.
  - [bugzilla: 569] Fix do_tcp is do-tcp in unbound.conf man page.
  - [bugzilla: 572] Fix unit test failure for systems with
    different /etc/ services.
  - iana portlist updated.
  - [bugzilla: 574] Fix make test fails on Ubuntu 14.04. Disabled
    remote-control in testbound scripts.
  - Documented that dump_requestlist only prints queries from
    thread 0.
  - [bugzilla: 567] Fix unbound lists if forward zone is secure or
    insecure with +i annotation in output of list_forwards, also
    for list_stubs (for NetworkManager integration). And remove ':'
    from output of stub and forward lists, this is easier to parse.
  - [bugzilla: 554] Fix use unsigned long to print 64bit statistics
    counters on 64bit systems.
  - [bugzilla: 558] Fix failed prefetch lookup does not remove
    cached response but delays next prefetch (in lieu of caching a
    SERVFAIL).
  - [bugzilla: 545] Fix improved logging, the ip address of the
    error is printed on the same log-line as the error.
  - [bugzilla: 502] Fix explain that do-ip6 disable does not stop
    AAAA lookups, but it stops the use of the ipv6 transport layer
    for DNS traffic.
  - Fix compile with libevent2 on FreeBSD.
  - Change MAX_SENT_COUNT from 16 to 32 to resolve some cases easier.
  - Fixup out-of-directory compile with unbound-control-setup.sh.in.
  - Code cleanup patch from Dag-Erling Smorgrav, with compiler
    issue fixes from FreeBSD's copy of Unbound, he notes: Generate
    unbound-control-setup.sh at build time so it respects prefix
    and sysconfdir from the configure script.  Also fix the umask
    to match the comment, and the comment to match the umask. Add
    const and static where needed. Use unions instead of playing
    pointer poker. Move declarations that are needed in multiple
    source files into a shared header. Move sldns_bgetc() from
    parse.c to buffer.c where it belongs. Introduce a new header
    file, worker.h, which declares the callbacks that all workers
    must define. Remove those declarations from libworker.h.
    Include the correct headers in the correct places. Fix a few
    dummy callbacks that don't match their prototype. Fix some
    casts. Hide the sbrk madness behind #ifdef HAVE_SBRK. Remove a
    useless printf which breaks reproducible builds. Get rid of
    CONFIGURE_{TARGET,DATE,BUILD_WITH} now that they're no longer
    used. Add unbound-control-setup.sh to the list of generated
    files. The prototype for libworker_event_done_cb() needs to be
    moved from libunbound/libworker.h to libunbound/worker.h.
  - Fix caps-for-id fallback, and added fallback attempt when
    servers drop 0x20 perturbed queries.
  - [bugzilla: 593] Fix segfault or crash upon rotating logfile.
  - fake-rfc2553 patch (thanks Benjamin Baier).

    directory and auto load it.
  - [bugzilla: 613] Allow tab ws in var length last rdfs (in ldns
    str2wire).
  - [bugzilla: 614] Fix man page variable substitution bug.
  - Whitespaces after $ORIGIN are not part of the origin dname
    (ldns).
  - $TTL's value starts at position 5 (ldns).

    module.
  - Fix unbound capsforid fallback, it ignores TTLs in comparison.
  - [bugzilla: 617] Fix in ldns in unbound, lowercase WKS services.
  - Fix ctype invocation casts.
  - Disabled use of SSLv3 in remote-control and ssl-upstream.
  - Redefine internal minievent symbols to unique symbols that
    helps linking on platforms where the linker leaks names across
    modules.
