  <title>Extension for rxvt-unicode that allows changing the font size on the fly</title>
  <description>A perl extension for rxvt-unicode that allows changing the font size on the fly with keyboard shortcuts. It has the following features:
  - Supports both xft and X11 fonts; X11 fonts work in both full form and as aliases.
  - Supports all four font settings: font, boldFont, italicFont and boldItalicFont and changes them in accordance with the base font (the first one from font).
  - Can apply the font change globally for the whole server, so that new terminals will inherit the same size, and even save it to ~/.Xresources to be able to survive a reboot.
  - Should work even with complicated font setups like the example in the urxvt man-page.</description>
