Mon Mar 11 18:15:48 UTC 2024 - Michael Pujos <pujos.michael@gmail.com>

- added fix-keyutils-module-conflict.patch to fix failure for udiskie
  to start due to conflict with package python311-keyring-keyutils
  providing module 'keyutils' while udiskie expects a module with that
  name from (optionally installed) package 'python3-keyutils'
  (which does not exist in the repo)
- Update to 2.5.2:
  * drop external dependency on distutils
  * rename --notify-command to --event-hook to prevent misunderstandings
- Update to 2.5.1:
  * fix default install location for bash completion scripts

  * add bash completions for CLI options (thanks @oersen)
  * updates for translations

  * ignore snap loop devices by default
  * maintenance on CI workflows
  * fix KeyError when properties are invalidated multiple times

    if a wayland session is or was active under the same user (even if that was in a different login session)

- Update to 2.1.1 
  * handle XDG_CONFIG_HOME variable without external pyxdg dependency
  * silence warning when using AppIndicator

    required ``--tray``)
  * improve wording in password dialog "Remember" -> "Cache"
  * make some of the logging more concise
  * fix recursive adding/removing of some child devices:
    - fix incorrect root device detection for devices without Drive property
      (e.g. children of loop devices)
    - fix ``--detach`` option when applied to partitions of loop devices

Tue Feb  4 07:07:52 UTC 2020 - Paolo Stivanin <info@paolostivanin.com>

- Update to 2.1.0

  * change how is_external attribute is compute: use the value from udisks directly (fixes issue with is_external property not behaving as expected, see #185)
  * add 'skip' keyword for rules to skip evaluation of further rules on this device, and continue directly on the parent
  * fix user commands that output non-utf8 data
  * fix exception when using non-device parameters with DeviceCommand (e.g. in --notify-command)
  * hotfix for automounting being broken since 2.0.0

  * require python >= 3.5
