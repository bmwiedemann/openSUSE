- Update to 2.1.0
  * fix some typos (thanks @torstehu, #197)

  * change how is_external attribute is compute: use the value from udisks directly (fixes issue with is_external property not behaving as expected, see #185)
  * add 'skip' keyword for rules to skip evaluation of further rules on this device, and continue directly on the parent
  * fix user commands that output non-utf8 data
  * fix exception when using non-device parameters with DeviceCommand (e.g. in --notify-command)
  * hotfix for automounting being broken since 2.0.0
  * use importlib.resources directly on py3.7 and above, rather than requiring importlib_resources as additional dependency
  * require python >= 3.5

  * keep password dialog always on top
  * fix stdin-based password prompts
