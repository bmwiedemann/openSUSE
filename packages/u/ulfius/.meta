  <title>Web Framework for REST Applications in C</title>
  <description>Based on GNU Libmicrohttpd for the backend web server, Jansson for the
json manipulation library, and Libcurl for the http/smtp client API.

Used to facilitate creation of web applications in C programs with a
small memory footprint, as in embedded systems applications.

One can create webservices in HTTP or HTTPS mode, stream data, or
implement server websockets.
