  <title>A byte Unix benchmarks</title>
  <description>The design flaw was that the benchmarks timed a fixed number of loops;
if there were too few loops, the times were too small to be reliable.
Perhaps we could have increased the number of loops and been safe for
another few years (months?).</description>
