  <title>Improve Lighting, Correct Exposure, Add Synthetic Light to Photos</title>
  <description>Urban Lightscape is a photo filter for exposure correction,
localized brightness adjustments, dodging and burning, and the
introduction of synthetic lighting to a photo. A simple
&quot;double-click-and-drag&quot; paradigm is used to place control points on
a photo, and clever edge detection localises and interpolates
lightness adjustments around and between these points. Results are
rapid, with additional controls for more subtle refinements.
