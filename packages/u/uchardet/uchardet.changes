      Windows-1252 and Windows-1257.
    + Finnish - ISO-8859-1, ISO-8859-4, ISO-8859-9, ISO-8859-13,

    + Irish Gaelic - ISO-8859-1, ISO-8859-9, ISO-8859-15 and
      WINDOWS-1252.
    + Italian - ISO-8859-1, ISO-8859-3, ISO-8859-9, ISO-8859-15
      and WINDOWS-1252.
    + Latvian - ISO-8859-4, ISO-8859-10 and ISO-8859-13

  * EUC-KR now returned as UHC: despite differences, mostly
    upward compatible. Let's return UHC until separate detection
    machines are implemented.
  * uchardet CLI tool now supports the end-of-options -- option
    to be able to process any file starting with a dash.
  * uchardet_handle_data() API considers an empty string input
    as successful processing to improve automatic detection from
    random input sources.
  * Repository code now requires C++1 standard.
  * Several bugs fixed.

- Update to version 0.0.6:
- Improve ASCII and ISO-8859-1 detection.
- Improve language models: Greek, Hungarian.
- New supports:
  * Arabic - ISO-8859-6 and Windows-1256.
  * Danish - Windows-1252, ISO-8859-1 and ISO-8859-15.
  * Spanish - ISO-8859-1, ISO-8859-15 and Windows-1252.
  * Vietnamese - VISCII and Windows-1258.
- Improve single-byte encoding detection algorithm by giving more weight
  to "probable" sequences (less frequent than "positive" sequence, yet
  not "negative").
- `uchardet` command line tool improved:
  * exits with non-zero return values on error.
- CMake build improved with more options:
  * Binary can be installed to non-default dir.
  * Allow building static-only builds.
  * Allow not building the command line tool.
  * Add static lib destination.
- Changes from 0.0.4 to 0.0.5:
- Revert UTF-16 and UTF-32 label change:
  it was an error to specify endianness for texts with BOM.
  The Unicode standard explicitly warns against it, and it actually
  even (partially) break conversions.
- Added supports:
    - French: Windows-1252.
    - German: ISO-8859-1, Windows-1252
    - Esperanto: ISO-8859-3
    - Turkish: ISO-8859-3 and ISO-8859-9
    - Thai: ISO-8859-11 (and TIS-620 model rebuilt).
- Single Byte charset detection algorithm improved:
  detection of control characters lowers confidence.
- Changes from 0.0.3 to 0.0.4:
- Add support of ISO-8859-1 and ISO-8859-15 for French.
- Re-enable Hungarian language models (ISO-8859-2 and Windows-1250)
  which used to conflict with other charsets (should be better now).
- Differentiate ASCII detection and detection failure.
- Improve single-byte charset detection confidence algorithm (fixes for
  instance Windows-1251 Russian text detection).
- "UTF-16" is now outputted with endianness information (UTF-16LE/BE).
- Add UTF-32 BOM detection.
- Discard single byte charsets upon illegal codepoint detection.
- Internal redesign of single-byte charmaps with more semantics, and
  variable sample size length (different languages have different sizes
  of grapheme lists).
- A lot more test files (33 successful unit tests should be successful
  with `make test`).
- Adding python scripts to generate language models from Wikipedia data
  in a single command.
- Changes from 0.0.2 to 0.0.3:
- A quick release after 0.0.2 mostly to fix a bad crash on the command
  line tool when charset detection failed (or detected ASCII).
- The build now includes more test files for various language/encoding
  and a `make test` target for unit testing (20 encoding detection tests
  should be successful upon running it).
- The build has a new BUILD_STATIC option, by default set to ON,
  allowing to disable static library building if not needed.
- All encoding names are iconv-compatible, enabling developers to
  directly feed the result of uchardet_get_charset() into libiconv.
- Compilation warnings fixed.
- Changes from 0.0.1 to 0.0.2:
- Version 0.0.2 mostly fixes various bugs and allow querying charsets
  for multiple files in the same command with uchardet command line tool.
