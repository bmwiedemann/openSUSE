    -Fix busy wait due endless recursion when interface_count is zero
  + usbredirhost:
    -Fix leak on error

Tue Feb 16 09:41:33 UTC 2016 - mkravec@suse.com

- Update to version 0.7.1
  + usbredirfilter:
    -force check to device which had all interfaces skipped. This fix a bug
     which allow a KVM device to be redirect when it should not
  + usbredirparser:
    -allow missing capabilities from source host when loading a USB
     redirection stream during a qemu migration
  + usbredirhost:
    -new callback to drop isoc packets when application's pending writes buffer
     size is too big; The threshold calculation aims at 10fps as worst case to
     give at least 150ms of continuous data to application.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct 15 12:36:35 UTC 2014 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 0.7:
  + usbredirproto:
    - The usb_redir_ep_info_header has been extended with a
      max_streams field, this is only send / received if both sides
      have usb_redir_cap_bulk_streams.
    - Change bulk_stream packet definitions to allow allocating/
      freeing streams on multiple endpoints in one go, technically
      this is a protocol change, but no-one has implemented
      usb_redir_cap_bulk_streams so far, so we can safely do this.
    - Add a USBREDIR_VERSION define so applications can test
      against which version they are building.
  + usbredirparser: Fix a bug causing parsing breakage when
    receiving a hello packet with 64 bit id capabiliy and another
    packet in succession so that they both got parsed in one
    usbredirparser_do_read call.
  + usbredirhost:
    - Use libusb_set_auto_detach_kernel_driver when available.
    - Add support for bulk streams, this only gets enabled with
      libusbx >= 1.0.19.
    - Stop iso / bulk streams on reset.
    - Make cancellation handeling more robust.
    - Reset device on release.
  + usbredirserver: Listen to both ipv4 and ipv6 addresses on ipv6
    capable systems.

Sun Dec 23 11:28:14 UTC 2012 - zaitor@opensuse.org

  + usbredirproto:
    - add support for bulk packets with 32 bits length
    - add support for buffered bulk input
  + usbredirparser:
    - add support for bulk packets with 32 bits length
    - add support for buffered bulk input
  + usbredirhost:
    - add support for bulk packets with 32 bits length
    - queue multiple transfers for interrupt receiving
    - add support for buffered bulk input
    - only apply mult to max-packet-size for isoc high speed
      endpoints
    - add a do-not-reset device blacklist, populate it with
      1210:001c
- Changes from version 0.5.3:
  + usbredirparser:
    - add support for bulk packets longer then 65535 bytes
  + usbredirhost:
    - add support for bulk packets longer then 65535 bytes

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec  3 12:23:33 UTC 2012 - p.drouand@gmail.com

- Rename libusbredirparser0 to libusbredirparser1:
  The lib version has changed

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec  3 12:22:16 UTC 2012 - p.drouand@gmail.com

- Update to version 0.5.2:
  + usbredirparser:
    -rename libusbredirparser.pc to libusbredirparser-0.5.pc
     This should really have been done with the 0.5 release as API
     compatibility with previous releases was broken there!
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec  3 12:21:00 UTC 2012 - p.drouand@gmail.com

- Update to version 0.5.1:
  + usbredirparser:
    -usbredirparser_has_data_to_write now returns the write queue depth,
     instead of only 0 or 1
  + usbredirhost:
    -usbredirhost_has_data_to_write now returns the write queue depth,
     instead of only 0 or 1
    -when the write queue gets too large, drop isochronous input packets

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec  3 12:18:34 UTC 2012 - p.drouand@gmail.com

- Update to version 0.5:
  -Windows support 
  -Add support for 64 bit packet ids
  -usbredirparser:
  -Add state serialization support
  -API and ABI changed to use 64 bit ids,
  -usbredirhost:
  -Remove bulk packets time out, this fixes various devices not working
  -Ack packet cancels immediately
  -Now supports 64 bits packet ids
  -Use libusb_error_name instead of logging raw error codes
  -usbredirfilter_check return -ENOENT rather then -EPERM if no rules match a
   device, this way the caller can differentiate between a deny caused by a
   matching rule, and one caused by there being no matching rules.

Fri Apr 20 09:41:31 UTC 2012 - joop.boonen@opensuse.org

- Update to version 0.4.3:
  + usbredirhost:
    - Don't crash on devices in unconfigured state
    - Restore original device configuration when releasing the device
    - Significantly speed up reset handling
  + usbredirserver:
      -Add a manpage

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar  9 12:40:38 UTC 2012 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 0.4.2:
  + Add usb_redir_babble status code
  + usbredirparser:
    - extend the usb_redir_ep_info packet header with a
      max_packet_size field
  + usbredirhost:
    - Ensure we always re-attach kernel drivers on cleanup
    - Make set_config handling more robust
    - A set_config or a reset can cause us to loose access to the
      device
- Changes from version 0.4.1:
  + Brown paper bag release, fix a return without value in a non
    void function
- Changes from version 0.4:
  + Add usb_redir_filter_reject and usb_redir_filter_filter
    packets and an usb_redir_cap_filter capability flag
  + Add an usb_redir_device_disconnect_ack packet and an
    usb_redir_cap_device_disconnect_ack capability flag
  + usbredirparser:
    - Add an usbredirparser_have_peer_caps function
  + usbredirhost:
    - Allow re-using a host instance with multiple devices
    - Quite a few bugfixes

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan 31 09:48:20 UTC 2012 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 0.3.3:
  + usbredirparser:
    - add usbredirfilter code, to help apps exclude certain devices
      from redirection.
  + usbredirhost:
    - add a usbredirhost_check_device_filter helper function.
- Changes from version 0.3.2:
  + Switched to automake/autoconf/libtool based make system
  + usbredirparser:
    - limited multi-thread safeness, see README.multi-thread
    - extend the device_connect packet header with a device_version
      field
    - Add a hello_func callback which gets called after receiving
      the hello packet from the other side. This can be used to
      determine when the caps from the other side have been
      received and it thus is safe to call
      usbredirparser_send_device_connect.
  + usbredirhost:
    - limited multi-thread safeness, see README.multi-thread
    - properly handle clear stalls send from the usbguest
    - try to keep our iso buffer size near the target size
    - implement usb_redir_cap_connect_device_version
- Call configure instead of exporting LDFLAGS and CPPFLAGS; this
  is now possible as upstream switched to auto*.
