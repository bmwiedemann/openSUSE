  <title>A file synchronization tool</title>
  <description>Unison is a file synchronization tool for Unix and Windows. It allows
two replicas of a collection of files and directories to be stored on
different hosts (or different disks on the same host), modified
separately, then brought up to date by propagating the changes in each
replica to the other.</description>
