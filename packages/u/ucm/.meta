  <title>Unicode Font Viewer</title>
  <description>Ucm is a small xfs-like widget specifically designed for Unicode fonts.
 As opposed to xfs, ucm allows you to select an arbitrary character
which can then be pasted into another application or identify an
arbitrary character by pasting it into ucm.</description>
