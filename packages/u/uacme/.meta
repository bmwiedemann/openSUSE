  <title>A minimal ACMEv2 client</title>
  <description>uacme is a client for the ACMEv2 protocol described in RFC8555,
written in plain C code with minimal dependencies.
The ACMEv2 protocol allows a Certificate Authority and an
applicant to automate the process of verification and certificate
issuance. The protocol also provides facilities for other
certificate management functions, such as certificate revocation.
