%description
The UPM repository provides software drivers for a wide variety of commonly
used sensors and actuators. These software drivers interact with the
underlying hardware platform (or microcontroller), as well as with the
attached sensors, through calls to MRAA APIs.

%description devel
The UPM repository provides software drivers for a wide variety of commonly
used sensors and actuators. These software drivers interact with the
underlying hardware platform (or microcontroller), as well as with the
attached sensors, through calls to MRAA APIs.

Programmers can access the interfaces for each sensor by including the
sensorâ€™s corresponding header file and instantiating the associated sensor
class. In the typical use case, a constructor initializes the sensor based
on parameters that identify the sensor, the I/O protocol used and the pin
location of the sensor.

This package contains development files for %{name}.
