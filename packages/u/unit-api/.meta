  <title>JSR 363 - Units of Measurement API</title>
  <description>The Unit of Measurement library provides a set of
Java language programming interfaces for handling
units and quantities. The interfaces provide a layer
which separates client code, which would call the
API, from library code, which implements the API.

The specification contains Interfaces and abstract
classes with methods for unit operations:

* Checking of unit compatibility
* Expression of a quantity in various units
* Arithmetic operations on units
