- Update to 2.57:
  * Added aam/aad imm8 missing instruction variant.
  * Added corrections for constant too large warnings and included >64bit size immediate errors.
  * Corrected a conflict between local and struct having the same name.
  * Updated the encoding of xchg eax,eax to not just be a NOP in 64bit code as a side effect is
    clearing the top half of RAX.
  * Reduced unnecessary REX prefixes in PROC prologue.
  * Cleaned up makefile names
  * Fixed a general failure on empty unions.
  * Applied typedef ptr fix in legacy codeview symbolic debugging info.
  * Noted string literal usage in manual.
  * Fixed a stack balancing regression leading to an umatched add/sub rsp,8 pair forLinux 64bit.
  * Prevented vmovd/vmovq from accepting ymm or zmm registes.
  * Prevent OR rax,64bit immediate and other instructions that aren't MOV.
  * Based on a patch to original Jwasm which may have entered an infinite loop if a structured
    variable wasn't defined (yet), but a member name matched a local name.
  * Included Vortex Def2Lib utility in the distribution with Import Definitions kindly supplied
    from MASM32.
    Can be run via MakeLib.bat or    
    def2lib *.def
    def2lib ntvdm.def -e
