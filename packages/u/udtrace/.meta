  <title>Unix domain socket tracing</title>
  <description>This is a LD_PRELOAD wrapper library which can be used to trace the
data sent and/or received via unix domain sockets.

Unlike IP based communication that can be captured/traced with pcap
programs like tcpdump or wireshark, there is no similar mechanism
available for unix domain sockets.

This LD_PRELOAD library intercepts the C library function calls of
dynamically linked programs. It will detect all file descriptors
representing unix domain sockets and will then print traces of all
data sent/received via the socket.
