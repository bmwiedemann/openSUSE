  <title>Power Device Enumeration Framework</title>
  <description>UPower is an abstraction for enumerating power devices, listening to
device events and querying history and statistics. Any application or
service on the system can access the org.freedesktop.UPower service
via the system message bus. Some operations (such as suspending the
system) are restricted using PolicyKit.</description>
