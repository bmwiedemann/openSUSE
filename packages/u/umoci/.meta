  <description>umoci modifies Open Container images.

umoci intends to be a complete manipulation tool for OCI images. In particular,
it should be seen as a more end-user-focused version of the oci-image-tools
provided by the OCI. The hope is that all of this tooling will eventually be
merged with the upstream repository, so that it is always kept up-to-date by
the Open Container Initiative community.</description>
