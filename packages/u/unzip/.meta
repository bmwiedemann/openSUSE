  <title>A program to unpack compressed files</title>
  <description>UnZip is an extraction utility for archives compressed in .zip format
(known as &quot;zip files&quot;).  Although highly compatible both with PKWARE's
PKZIP(tm) and PKUNZIP utilities for MS-DOS and with Info-ZIP's own Zip
program, our primary objectives have been portability and non-MS-DOS
functionality. This version can also extract encrypted archives.</description>
