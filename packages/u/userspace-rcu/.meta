  <title>Userspace Read-Copy-Update Library</title>
  <description>liburcu is a LGPLv2.1 userspace RCU (read-copy-update) library. This data
synchronization library provides read-side access which scales linearly with
the number of cores. It does so by allowing multiples copies of a given data
structure to live at the same time, and by monitoring the data structure
accesses to detect grace periods after which memory reclamation is possible.
