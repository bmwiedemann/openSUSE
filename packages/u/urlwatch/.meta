  <description>urlwatch is intended to help you watch URLs and get notified (via email or in your terminal) of any changes. The change notification will include the URL that has changed and a unified diff of what has changed.

The script supports the use of a filtering hook function to strip trivially-varying elements of a webpage.</description>
