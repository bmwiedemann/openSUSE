-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan  4 10:59:57 UTC 2021 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 2.22:
  Added:
  * Added 'wait_until' option to browser jobs to configure how long
    the headless browser will wait for pages to load.
  * Jobs now have an optional treat_new_as_changed (default false)
    key that can be set, and will treat newly-found pages as changed,
	and display a diff from the empty string (useful for diff_tool
	or diff_filter with side effects)
  * New reporters: discord, mattermost
  * New key user_visible_url for URL jobs that can be used to show a
    different URL in reports (useful if the watched URL is a REST API
	endpoint, but the report should link to the corresponding web page)
  * The Markdown reporter now supports limiting the report length via
    the max_length parameter of the submit method. The length limiting
	logic is smart in the sense that it will try trimming the details first,
	followed by omitting them completely, followed by omitting the summary.
	If a part of the report is omitted, a note about this is added to the
	report. (PR#572, by Denis Kasak)
  Changed:
  * Diff output is now generated more uniformly, independent of whether
    the input data has a trailing newline or not; if this behavior is not
	intended, use an external diff_tool (PR#550, by Adam Goldsmith)
  * The --test-diff-filter output now properly reports timestamps from the
    history entry instead of the current date and time (Fixes #573)
  * Unique GUIDs for jobs are now enforced at load time, append "#1",
    "#2", ... to the URLs to make them unique if you have multiple different
	jobs that share the same request URL (Fixes #586)
  * When a config, urls file or hooks file does not exist and should be
    edited or inited, its parent folders will be created (previously only
	the urlwatch configuration folder was created; Fixes #594)
  * Auto-matched filters now always get None supplied as subfilter; any
    custom filters must accept a subfilter parameter after the existing
	data parameter
  * Drop support for Python 3.5
  Fixed:
  * Make imports thread-safe: This might increase startup times a bit,
    as dependencies are imported on bootup instead of when first used.
	Importing in Python is not (yet) thread-safe, so we cannot import
	new modules from the worker threads reliably (Fixes #559, #601)
  * The Matrix reporter was improved in several ways (PR#572, by Denis Kasak):
    - The maximum length of the report was increase from 4096 to 16384.
    - The report length limiting is now implemented via the new length
	  limiting functionality of the Markdown reporter. Previously, the
	  report was simply trimmed at the end which could break the diff
	  blocks and make them render incorrectly.
    - The diff code blocks are now tagged as diffs which will allow the
	  diffs to be syntax highlighted as such. This doesn't yet work in
	  Element, pending on the resolution of trentm/python-markdown2#370.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul 31 06:40:19 UTC 2020 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 2.21:
  Added:
  * Added --test-reporter REPORTER command-line option to send an
    example report using any configured notification service
  * JobBase now has main_thread_enter() and main_thread_exit() functions
    that can be overridden by subclasses to run code in the main thread
    before and after processing of a job
  Removed:
  * The --test-slack command line option has been removed, you can test
    your Slack reporter configuration using --test-reporter slack
  Changed:
  * The browser job now uses Pyppeteer instead of Requests-HTML for
    rendering pages while executing JavaScript; this makes JavaScript
    execution work properly
  Fixed:
  * Applying legacy hooks.py filters 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul 30 06:21:57 UTC 2020 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 2.20:
  Added:
  * A job can now have a diff_filter set, which works the same way as
    the normal filter (and has the same filters available), but applies
    to the diff output instead of the page content (can be tested with
    --test-diff-filter, needs 2 or more historic snapshots in the cache)
  * Documentation now has a section on the configuration settings
    (--edit-config)
  * New filter: ocr to convert text in images to plaintext
    (using Tesseract OCR)
  * New reporters:
    - ifttt to send an event to If This Then That (ifttt.com)
      (#512, by Florian Gaultier)
    - xmpp to send a message using the XMPP (Jabber)
      protocol (#533, by Thorben Günther)
  Changed:
  * The urlwatch script (Git only) now works when run from different paths
  * Chunking of strings (e.g. for Slack and Telegram) now adds
    numbering (e.g. (1/2)) to the messages (only if a message is split
    into multiple parts)
  * Unit tests have been migrated from nose to pytest and moved from
    test/ to lib/urlwatch/tests/
  * The css and xpath filters now accept skip and maxitems as subfilter
  * The shellpipe filter now inherits all environment variables
    (e.g. $PATH) of the urlwatch process
  Fixed:
  * The html2text method lynx now treats any subfilters with a
    non-null value as command-line argument -key value (previously
    only the value true was treated like this, and any other values
    were silently dropped)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jul 18 08:41:33 UTC 2020 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 2.19:
  Added:
  * Documentation is now available at urlwatch.readthedocs.io and
    shipped in the source tarball under docs/; filter examples in
    the docs are unit-tested
  New filters:
  * reverse: Reverse input items (default: line-based) with optional separator
  * pdf2text: Convert PDF files to plaintext (must be first filter in chain)
  * shellpipe: Filter text with arbitrary command-line utilities / shell scripts
  * FilterBase API improvements for specifying subfilters:
    - Add __supported_subfilters__ for sub filter checking and --features output
    - Add __default_subfilter__ to map value-only parameters to
      dict parameters, for example the grep filter now has a default
      subfilter named re
  * Support for using Redis as a cache backend via --cache=redis://localhost:6379/
  Fixed:
  * Declare updated Python 3.5 dependency in setup.py
  Changed:
  * Filter improvements:
    - sort: Add reverse option to reverse the sorting order
    - sort: Add separator option to specify item separator (default is still line-based)
    - beautify: The jsbeautifier (for <script> tags) and cssbeautifier
      (for <style> tags) module dependencies are now optional
      if they are not installed, beautify only works on the HTML
    - Most filters that only had unnamed subfilters (e.g. grep)
      now have a named default subfilter
  * Reporter improvements:
    - pushover: The message priority can now be configured
    - Travis CI: Set pycodestyle version to 2.6.0 to avoid CI breakage
      when new style checks are added
    - Diff results are now runtime cached on a per-job basis, which shouldn't
      affect behavior, but could be observed by an external diff_tool
      running at most once per job instead of multiple times
    - Jobs with a custom diff_tool or a shellpipe filter are now ignored
      if jobs.yaml has the world-writable bit (o+w) set or is not owned by
      the current user (does not apply to Windows); previously only shell
      jobs were ignored if the permissions/owners were wrong
  Deprecated:
  * String-based filter definitions (e.g. html2text,grep:Current.*version,strip)
    are now deprecated, it is recommended to use YAML-based dictionary-style listing
    of filters, which is more flexible, easier to read and write and more structured

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May  4 06:46:45 UTC 2020 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

    (#404, by Chenfeng Bao)

    in Python 3.8; #424, by Chenfeng Bao)
  * Allow non-ASCII characters in format-json output filter
    (#433, by Mike Borsetti)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar  4 09:29:31 UTC 2020 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- This is a python3 application, so there's no need to require python2
  packages. Also, add a missing python3-cssselect dependency and make
  python3-keyring a recommndation since it's not really required
  (it seems to be used only to store the smtp password when enabled)
