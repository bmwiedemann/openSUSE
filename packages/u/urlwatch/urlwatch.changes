Fri Jul 31 06:40:19 UTC 2020 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 2.21:
  Added:
  * Added --test-reporter REPORTER command-line option to send an
    example report using any configured notification service
  * JobBase now has main_thread_enter() and main_thread_exit() functions
    that can be overridden by subclasses to run code in the main thread
    before and after processing of a job
  Removed:
  * The --test-slack command line option has been removed, you can test
    your Slack reporter configuration using --test-reporter slack
  Changed:
  * The browser job now uses Pyppeteer instead of Requests-HTML for
    rendering pages while executing JavaScript; this makes JavaScript
    execution work properly
  Fixed:
  * Applying legacy hooks.py filters 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul 30 06:21:57 UTC 2020 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 2.20:
  Added:
  * A job can now have a diff_filter set, which works the same way as
    the normal filter (and has the same filters available), but applies
    to the diff output instead of the page content (can be tested with
    --test-diff-filter, needs 2 or more historic snapshots in the cache)
  * Documentation now has a section on the configuration settings
    (--edit-config)
  * New filter: ocr to convert text in images to plaintext
    (using Tesseract OCR)
  * New reporters:
    - ifttt to send an event to If This Then That (ifttt.com)
      (#512, by Florian Gaultier)
    - xmpp to send a message using the XMPP (Jabber)
      protocol (#533, by Thorben GÃ¼nther)
  Changed:
  * The urlwatch script (Git only) now works when run from different paths
  * Chunking of strings (e.g. for Slack and Telegram) now adds
    numbering (e.g. (1/2)) to the messages (only if a message is split
    into multiple parts)
  * Unit tests have been migrated from nose to pytest and moved from
    test/ to lib/urlwatch/tests/
  * The css and xpath filters now accept skip and maxitems as subfilter
  * The shellpipe filter now inherits all environment variables
    (e.g. $PATH) of the urlwatch process
  Fixed:
  * The html2text method lynx now treats any subfilters with a
    non-null value as command-line argument -key value (previously
    only the value true was treated like this, and any other values
    were silently dropped)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jul 18 08:41:33 UTC 2020 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 2.19:
  Added:
  * Documentation is now available at urlwatch.readthedocs.io and
    shipped in the source tarball under docs/; filter examples in
    the docs are unit-tested
  New filters:
  * reverse: Reverse input items (default: line-based) with optional separator
  * pdf2text: Convert PDF files to plaintext (must be first filter in chain)
  * shellpipe: Filter text with arbitrary command-line utilities / shell scripts
  * FilterBase API improvements for specifying subfilters:
    - Add __supported_subfilters__ for sub filter checking and --features output
    - Add __default_subfilter__ to map value-only parameters to
      dict parameters, for example the grep filter now has a default
      subfilter named re
  * Support for using Redis as a cache backend via --cache=redis://localhost:6379/
  Fixed:
  * Declare updated Python 3.5 dependency in setup.py
  Changed:
  * Filter improvements:
    - sort: Add reverse option to reverse the sorting order
    - sort: Add separator option to specify item separator (default is still line-based)
    - beautify: The jsbeautifier (for <script> tags) and cssbeautifier
      (for <style> tags) module dependencies are now optional
      if they are not installed, beautify only works on the HTML
    - Most filters that only had unnamed subfilters (e.g. grep)
      now have a named default subfilter
  * Reporter improvements:
    - pushover: The message priority can now be configured
    - Travis CI: Set pycodestyle version to 2.6.0 to avoid CI breakage
      when new style checks are added
    - Diff results are now runtime cached on a per-job basis, which shouldn't
      affect behavior, but could be observed by an external diff_tool
      running at most once per job instead of multiple times
    - Jobs with a custom diff_tool or a shellpipe filter are now ignored
      if jobs.yaml has the world-writable bit (o+w) set or is not owned by
      the current user (does not apply to Windows); previously only shell
      jobs were ignored if the permissions/owners were wrong
  Deprecated:
  * String-based filter definitions (e.g. html2text,grep:Current.*version,strip)
    are now deprecated, it is recommended to use YAML-based dictionary-style listing
    of filters, which is more flexible, easier to read and write and more structured

-------------------------------------------------------------------

    in Python 3.8; #424, by Chenfeng Bao)
  * Allow non-ASCII characters in format-json output filter
    (#433, by Mike Borsetti)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar  4 09:29:31 UTC 2020 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- This is a python3 application, so there's no need to require python2
  packages. Also, add a missing python3-cssselect dependency and make
  python3-keyring a recommndation since it's not really required
  (it seems to be used only to store the smtp password when enabled)
