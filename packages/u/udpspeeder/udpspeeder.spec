%description
A tunnel which can improve network quality on high-latency and
lossy links by using Forward Error Correction, for all kinds of
traffic (TCP/UDP/ICMP).

When used alone, UDPspeeder improves only the UDP connection. By using
UDPspeeder and a UDP-based VPN together, any traffic can be improved.
Currently, OpenVPN/L2TP/ShadowVPN are known to be supported.
