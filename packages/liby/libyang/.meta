  <title>Parser toolkit for IETF YANG data modeling</title>
  <description>Libyang implements functions to process schemas expressed in the
YANG data modeling language defined by the IETF in RFCs 6020/7950.
Schemas expressed in this language primarily describe configuration
used by larger network equipment like routers and switches.

In addition to handling the schemas itself, the library also provides
functions to process data described by the schemas.

The library is implemented in C and provides an API for other software
to use in processing configurations.
