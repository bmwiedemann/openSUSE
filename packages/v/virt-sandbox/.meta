  <title>libvirt Sandbox</title>
  <description>The Libvirt Sandbox project is an effort to facilitate the use of libvirt virtualization drivers for the purpose of sandboxing applications. The key features of the project are:

* Choice of using LXC, QEMU or KVM as the virtualization technology to build the sandbox
* Provides a high level API to enable the construction of sandboxes
* Isolation from the need to understand the virtualization technology configuration
* Provides a “virt-sandbox” command line tool for running interactive commands
* Provides a “virt-sandbox-service” command line tool for provisioning system services
* Integration with systemd to setup service unit files inside a sandbox
