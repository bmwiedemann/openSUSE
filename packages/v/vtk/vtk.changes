-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun 15 14:47:31 UTC 2020 - Andreas Schwab <schwab@suse.de>

- Drop -ffat-lto-objects to avoid wasting disk space

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun 10 12:57:24 UTC 2020 - Guillaume GARDET <guillaume.gardet@opensuse.org>

- Update _constraints to avoid OOM errors

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun May 31 20:28:03 UTC 2020 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Add vtk-qt-5.15-include-QPainterPath.patch: Include QPainterPath
  to fix build failures against Qt 5.15; patch taken from
  upstream, see
  <https://gitlab.kitware.com/vtk/vtk/-/merge_requests/6943>.
- The %%cmake macro sets CMAKE_SKIP_RPATH=ON for Leap 15.x which
  causes build failures; set it to OFF and set
  CMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_RPATH=ON for openSUSE <= 1500. See
  <https://discourse.vtk.org/t/building-fails-generating-wrap-hierarchy-for-vtk-commoncore-unable-to-open-libvtkwrappingtools-so-1>.
- Build without pegtl for distributions where pegtl > 2.0 is
  unavailable (Leap 15.1).
- Disable java bindings for Leap 15.1 only where cmake still
  searches for the javah binary (and setting it to %{_bindir}/true
  seems to no longer work).
- Run ld post scripts for vtk-qt.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May  8 13:33:26 UTC 2020 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Update to version 9.0.0 
  * See https://discourse.vtk.org/t/vtk-9-0-0/3205.
- Rebase patches still required for building:
  * bundled_exodusii_add_missing_libpthread.patch: Update to
    upstream patch
    (https://gitlab.kitware.com/vtk/vtk/-/merge_requests/6865).
  * bundled_libharu_add_missing_libm.patch
- Pass VTK_PYTHON_OPTIONAL_LINK:BOOL=OFF to cmake to link against
  the system python library explicitly.
- Add vtk-parallelgeometry-dependency.patch to fix a missing
  dependency for vtkparallelgeometry (see
  https://discourse.vtk.org/t/building-vtk-9-0-fails-when-using-mpi-support/3227).
- Comment out 0001-Allow-compilation-on-GLES-platforms.patch that
  no longer applies and needs extensive rebasing.
- Drop patches incorporated or otherwise fixed upstream:
  * 0001-Make-code-calling-proj4-compatible-with-proj4-5.0-an.patch
  * 0001-Add-libogg-to-IOMovie-target-link-libraries.patch
  * python38.patch
  * reproducible.patch
- Adapt to changes in upstream's cmake script:
  * Replace old options by their newer versions where applicable.
  * Pass VTK_USE_EXTERNAL=ON to use system libraries by default
    except for gl2ps, haru, and pugixml.
- New BuildRequires: pegtl-devel and utfcpp-devel.
- No longer needed to pass
  Java_JAVAH_EXECUTABLE:PATH=%{_bindir}/true to cmake; script does
  not look for javah any more.
- Use autosetup to set up and patch sources: simplifies applying
  changing list of patches; use an if guard to avoid patch needing
  rebase while not running into conflict with factory bot.
- Use system gl2ps for openSUSE > 1500.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr 27 11:00:45 UTC 2020 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Fix serial builds broken due to disabling the building of
  examples; instead of commenting out sections of the specfile
  related to examples, use %bcond_with to disable building
  examples by default and the corresponding conditionals where
  appropriate.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Apr 26 04:21:40 UTC 2020 - Bernhard Wiedemann <bwiedemann@suse.com>

- add reproducible.patch to override build date and to sort entries
  (boo#1047218, boo#1041090)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr 24 08:28:02 UTC 2020 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Disable building examples to prevent vtkLocalExample.java
  randomly missing from vtk.jar (boo#1138295, see also upstream
  recommendation in
  https://gitlab.kitware.com/vtk/vtk/issues/17619).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 11 13:17:49 UTC 2020 - Stefan Brüns <stefan.bruens@rwth-aachen.de>

- Remove -DVTK_PYTHON_SITE_PACKAGES_SUFFIX silently added with the
  last change. As it specifies the path relative to the install
  prefix, setting it to the absolute python_sitearch is obviously
  wrong. As VTK figures out the correct path by itself, it is
  completely unnecessary.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 10 14:06:37 UTC 2020 - Tomáš Chvátal <tchvatal@suse.com>

- Add patch to fix building with python 3.8:
  * python38.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan 28 22:45:34 UTC 2020 - Stefan Brüns <stefan.bruens@rwth-aachen.de>

- Add openmpi3 flavor.
- Disable openmpi1 for SLE/Leap 15.2, openmpi3 for SLE <= 15.1
- Adjust disk _constraints.
- Drop vtk-fix-file-contains-date-time.patch, GCC honors
  SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH.
- Drop unused netcdf-c++-devel BuildRequires.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov  4 17:59:29 UTC 2019 - Stefan Brüns <stefan.bruens@rwth-aachen.de>

- Adapt to openmpi -> openmpi1 rename on Tumbleweed.
- Spec file cleanup, remove conditionals for Leap 42.x.
- Apply proj4 compatibility patch also on Leap.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep 10 20:00:01 UTC 2019 - Christophe Giboudeaux <christophe@krop.fr>

- Use -ffat-lto-objects when building static libraries.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Apr 14 10:14:39 UTC 2019 - Christophe Giboudeaux <christophe@krop.fr>

- Add more explicit dependencies to vtk-devel.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr  9 11:28:00 UTC 2019 - Christophe Giboudeaux <christophe@krop.fr>

- Add an explicit 'Requires: double-conversion-devel' for vtk-devel.
  The double-conversion library is mentioned in vtkdoubleconversion.cmake
  but isn't automatically installed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 15 18:42:02 UTC 2019 - Stefan Brüns <stefan.bruens@rwth-aachen.de>

- Update to version 8.2.0
  * Removed support for TCL and Qt4
  * Removed all VTK_OVERRIDE, VTK_FINAL, VTK_DELETE_FUNCTION macros as
    C++11 is now required.
  * vtkAbstractArray gained support for runtime user defined free functions,
    allowing for custom allocator memory to be used with VTK.
  * The vtkGeovis classes are now deprecated.
  See https://blog.kitware.com/vtk-8-2-0/ for a more exhaustive list.
- Packaging changes:
  * Python bindings for MPI flavors are now installed below the MPI prefix
    and thus no longer conflict with each other. To use these, the
    PYTHONPATH currently has to be amended manually.
  * Removed several devel Requires: from the devel package. This reduces the
    dependency chain (e.g. java-devel) for all packages building against VTK,
    but may require to specify some dependencies explicitly, depending on
    the used VTK modules and bindings.
- Patch updates/additions:
  * Rebase vtk-fix-file-contains-date-time.patch
  * Rebase 0001-Allow-compilation-on-GLES-platforms.patch
  * Drop obsolete fix_qt5_example_cmake.patch
  * Add bundled_libharu_add_missing_libm.patch
  * Add bundled_exodusii_add_missing_libpthread.patch
  * Add 0001-Add-libogg-to-IOMovie-target-link-libraries.patch
  * Add 0001-Make-code-calling-proj4-compatible-with-proj4-5.0-an.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jan  6 18:32:58 UTC 2019 - Stefan Brüns <stefan.bruens@rwth-aachen.de>

- Correct names of built packages, the mpi flavors were lacking the
  flavor specific name infix, i.e. all flavors were named identically.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan  2 23:19:48 UTC 2019 - Stefan Brüns <stefan.bruens@rwth-aachen.de>

- Add openmpi2 flavor
- BuildRequire netcdf-{mpi_flavor}-devel for MPI flavors
- Add Conflicts between flavors of python3 subpackage (all flavors
  install into python_sitearch).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Dec 14 23:15:27 UTC 2018 - Stefan Brüns <stefan.bruens@rwth-aachen.de>

- Convert openmpi package to multibuild flavor
- Use correct mpi version - openmpi currently means openmpi, and not openmpi2/3
  Otherwise, VTK depends on openmpi1 (HDF5, netcdf) and openmpi2/3 (direct)
- Remove several mpi BuildRequires in serial flavor

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec 12 19:32:47 UTC 2018 - Stefan Brüns <stefan.bruens@rwth-aachen.de>

- Add python3-vtk to vtk-devel Requires, same as for vtk-java/tcl
- Remove empty testing subpackage
- Fix path to VTK_DATA_ROOT default directory

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov 22 15:41:50 UTC 2018 - Todd R <toddrme2178@gmail.com>

- Update to version 8.1.2
  * Issue error if vtkAlgorithm::GetInputConnection called on wrong port
  * Added explicit cast to pacify UBSan’s “implicit-integer-truncation”
  * Make some orientation marker widget methods virtual 
  * vtkImageBlend bug fix for compound mode
  * vtkFlyingEdges2D: Properly color multiple isocontour values
  * Invoke DeletePointEvent before deleting vtkSeedWidget seed
  * Fix compilation issue due to Python3.7 API change 
  * Fix bug where re-enabling seed widget wouldn't move existing seeds
- Fix python dependencies
- Test to make sure python package is importable
- Split out MPI version since the MPI version cannot be used
  outside an MPI environment.
- Build vtkData as part of the main package.  This makes sure the
  data is extracted into the correct format.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun 29 07:17:51 UTC 2018 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Drop post[un] scripts for devel and java subpackages; they are
  only needed for the versioned shlib.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun 11 20:06:48 UTC 2018 - toddrme2178@gmail.com

- Update to version 8.1.1:
  * Fixed thin border around vtkImageResliceMapper
    rendering
  * Fixed vtkImageResliceMapper showing a black
    polygon when slice is out of bounds.
  * Fixed conflict between Process.h and process.h
  * Fixed building VTK 8.1 against 10.13 SDK
    resulting in linker errors when trying to use
    resulting libraries on older SDK
  * Fixed vtkCellPicker::IntersectActorWithLine maybe
    using invalid cell id when picking composite data
- Add fix_qt5_example_cmake.patch
  Fixes use of removed cmake macro in some examples
  See: https://gitlab.kitware.com/vtk/vtk/issues/17336
- Use modern cmake spec file macros
- Run spec cleaner
- Other spec file cleanups
- Support parallel HDF5.
- Drop support for qt4.  Any version of openSUSE with a recent
  enough version of cmake to build the package supports Qt5.
- Drop checks for old versions of openSUSE that have too old
  of a cmake to build.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Feb  4 00:41:17 UTC 2018 - stefan.bruens@rwth-aachen.de

- Use split libboost*-devel BuildRequires for TW and Leap/SLE 15

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan 24 11:28:47 UTC 2018 - fstrba@suse.com

- Fix build with jdk10
  * give a bogus javah path "%{_bindir}/true", since the cmake
    checks the javah binary although the build does not use it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan 12 13:43:49 UTC 2018 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Drop vtk-Rinterface-uintptr_t.patch as the related plugin has
  been retired.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan 10 12:34:03 UTC 2018 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Drop vtk-compat_gl: Building against OpenGL1 has now been
  deprecated with version 8.1.0, and the examples don't build
  against it already; so, drop all specfile and related
  modifications catering to OpenGL1 bindings.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec 28 11:22:29 UTC 2017 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Update to version 8.1.0:
  * Full release notes at https://blog.kitware.com/vtk-8-1-0/.
- Turn OFF building against system libharu, since libharu
  upstream seems dead, while vtk's included libharu has new
  features essential for building vtk 8.1. Drop BuildRequires on
  libharu.
- Does not build against java 10, so ensure at most java 9 is
  used by using appropriate versioning for java-devel
  BuildRequires.
- Drop cmake options no longer used for build.
- Drop VERBOSE=1 for make: it makes the compilation too verbose
  making brp checks for code warnings too slow to execute; this
  reduces build time by nearly half.
- Enforce Qt4 for openSUSE <= 1320 explicitly because Qt5 is now
  the default option.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec  4 18:25:57 UTC 2017 - bruno@ioda-net.ch

- Move BuildRequires:  libQtWebKit-devel (Qt4) inside the else
  version < 13.2 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct 26 08:48:16 UTC 2017 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Add conflict between the -devel-doc variants.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct 24 11:55:17 UTC 2017 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Setup MPI environment before building.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct 12 20:47:27 UTC 2017 - jengelh@inai.de

- Rectify RPM groups again.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Oct  1 20:36:49 UTC 2017 - stefan.bruens@rwth-aachen.de

- Move the vtk binary to the tcl subpackage, it is an interactive
  TCL shell, and depends on the TCL bindings. It can be used
  standalone from the devel package. Dito for its MPI variant, i.e.
  the pvtk binary.
- Move all libvtk*Java.so to the java subpackage. These are part of
  the Java bindings, i.e. runtime dependencies. Otherwise, the java
  subpacakge depends on the devel subpackage.
- Add the tcl and java subpackage to the devel requires again.
  Although not stricly necessary until building java or tcl packages,
  the cmake files have a hard dependency on several build artifacts
  provided by the tcl and java subpackages. Split devel packages
  for the bindings would be preferred, but this is not supported by
  the upstream build system.
- Remove the openmpi-devel requires in the python subpackage, the
  mpi runtime libraries are provided by openmpi-libs, which is
  picked up automatically.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Oct 01 17:04:57 UTC 2017 - stefan.bruens@rwth-aachen.de

- Split the API documentation from the development subpackage. The
  documentation amounts to almost 1 GByte of data, not necessary
  when just building packages.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 28 10:43:27 UTC 2017 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Drop vtk-compat_gl-rpmlintrc: openSUSE:Factory bots don't accept
  conditional sources and one rpmlintrc file is sufficient for
  both main and linked packages anyway.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep 19 10:46:40 UTC 2017 - kkhere.geo@gmail.com

- do not exclude libViewsGeovisJava.so from devel package 
  This library is required for development.
- package vtk binary in devel package.
- VTKTargets-debug.cmake tests for the existance of the library (line 3394)
  and the binary (line 3404) and causes an error if the files do
  not exist

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 14 20:54:34 UTC 2017 - stefan.bruens@rwth-aachen.de

- Remove the various subpackage Requires from the devel package
  again. The qt subpackage contains a Qt Designer plugin and no
  dependency at all. Package the vtkWrap{Tcl,Java,Python} wrapper
  generators in the devel package, as these are useless without
  the vtk headers files.
- Fix description/summary of vtk-qt subpackage

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep 12 12:33:38 UTC 2017 - kkhere.geo@gmail.com

- devel subpackage should require -tcl, -java and -qt subpackages
  since the *.cmake files refer to files in those subpackages

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 11 13:46:28 UTC 2017 - stefan.bruens@rwth-aachen.de

- Add 0001-Allow-compilation-on-GLES-platforms.patch
  The QOpenGLFunctions_3_2_Core class providing the framebuffer
  blit functions is not available on GLES 2 builds of Qt5. Let Qt
  handle the framebuffer blit, and just use the GLES/GL subset
  provided by QOpenGLFunctions for the remainder.
  Fix for https://gitlab.kitware.com/vtk/vtk/issues/17113

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep  1 00:13:18 UTC 2017 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Update to version 8.0.1:  
  * Fix QVTKOpenGLWidget rendering issues on Windows machines with
    certain Intel graphics chips. This was a significant issue
    that broke all rendering and resulted in a black screen.
  * Fix data array range caching per finite component which would
    otherwise cause considerable slow-downs when using data
    arrays.
  * Fix button and slider widgets to work in multi-viewport render
    windows. Without this change the widgets would either be
    placed in the wrong viewport or be non-interactive completely.
  * Fix image XY sampling in the volume mapper when depth peeling
    is enabled.
  * Fix z-fighting issues with dual depth peeling between two
    layers of geometry that are too close.
  * Fix crash when reparenting the QVTKWidget to a different
    window. The application would crash due to lack of OpenGL
    resources for the reparented widget.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 21 18:41:37 UTC 2017 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Suppress romlint error about shlib-policy-name-error for
  %{name}-java -- libvtkViewsGeovisJava.so packaged therein
  is not a versioned shared lib, and only used by vtk's java
  bindings, so there is no point in enforcing the shared lib
  packaging policy for this subpackage.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug  9 10:40:59 UTC 2017 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Move libvtkViewsGeovisJava.so to the %{name}-java subpackage,
  this is not really a devel file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug  9 08:54:55 UTC 2017 - jengelh@inai.de

- Fix RPM groups. Use POSIX-compliant find call.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug  7 09:13:03 UTC 2017 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Implement shared library packaging policy for vtk:
  + Rename %{name} to %{shlib}.
  + Move all shared library objects to %{shlib} package.
  + Remove no longer needed Requires from %{name}-devel package;
    e.g.: %{name}-java contains the java binaries and jar object
    now, and no longer the lib*Java.so file which has been moved
    into %{shlib}.
  + Adapt conflicts for vtk-compat_gl accordingly.
  + Install libraries to /usr/lib(64) instead of
    /usr/lib(64)/vtk.
  + Do away with python3-%{name}-qt subpackage and
    Obsolete/Provide it from %{shlib} as it only contained a
    shared lib object.
- Use system mpi4py; add BuildRequires on python3-mpi4py.
- liblz4 >= 1.7.3 now required (since version 8.0); adapt
  BuildRequires accordingly.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul 25 00:04:11 UTC 2017 - jengelh@inai.de

- Trim descriptions and rectify RPM groups.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul 17 23:37:37 UTC 2017 - adrian@suse.de

- add liblz4-devel and libharu-devel also to Requires of devel package
  (fixes linking errors in other packages)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul  3 13:47:05 UTC 2017 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Update to version 8.0.0: 
  * Read about changes here: https://blog.kitware.com/vtk-8-0-0/
  * API changes:
    http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK/API_Changes_7_1_0_to_8_0_0
- Add BuildRequires on liblz4-devel, libharu-devel, mandatory
  requirements for version 8.0.0.
- Run make DoxygenDoc to generate documentation.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr 14 18:18:36 UTC 2017 - kkhere.geo@gmail.com

- add a separate package vtk-compat_gl compile using rendering backend
  OpenGL for systems without brand new graphic cards
- default package vtk still uses new rendering backend default OpenGL2

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov 23 10:28:02 UTC 2016 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Update to version 7.1.0: See news item at
  https://blog.kitware.com/kitware-plans-to-spotlight-new-vtk-and-paraview-releases-at-sc16/
- Drop patch vtk-gcc6.patch, upstreamed.
- Turn off usage of system DIY2, this library is not yet packaged
  for openSUSE.
- Disable mkg3states binary also for openSUSE:Leap versions.
- Update file list for upstream installation changes.
- Use bundled gl2ps, as it no longer builds against the system
  one (requires svn trunk version of gl2ps).
- CMake >= 3.4 is now required (earlier versions don't support
  NAMES_PER_DIR in find_program).
- Enable use of SYSTEM_LIBRARIES for openSUSE:Leap versions too
  (only 13.2 requires this turned off as of now).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug 10 00:56:56 UTC 2016 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Refresh vtk-Rinterface-uintptr_t.patch to fix further issues
  with uintptr_t redefinition by defining the HAVE_UINTPTR_T
  macro using cmake functions; removing the #include of stdint.h
  is not needed any more since we will not be using the defs from
  Rinterface.h anyway (boo#985386). Although this really causes a
  build failure for the i586 arch, where the redefinition of
  unitptr_t in Rinterface.h conflicts with the stdint.h defintion,
  the patch is applied generally because the redefinition is not
  needed in any case. Patch sent upstream.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr 13 11:32:12 UTC 2016 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Add freetype2-devel as a Requires for vtk-devel.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 30 14:31:03 UTC 2016 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Apply vtk-gcc6.patch also to python-vtk.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 30 13:08:09 UTC 2016 - stecue@gmail.com

- Fixed RPATH error for Factory by passing the option
  CMAKE_NO_BUILTIN_CHRPATH:BOOL=ON to cmake. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 29 20:27:32 UTC 2016 - dmueller@suse.com

- add vtk-gcc6.patch: Fix build with gcc 6
- skip RPATH setting

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 18 19:27:34 UTC 2016 - stecue@gmail.com

- openmpi-libs will be installed with openmpi-devel if necessary.
  No such package on openSUSE 13.1.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 15 13:33:58 UTC 2016 - dvaleev@suse.com

- Add disk constraints 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb 17 01:13:12 UTC 2016 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Update to version 7.0.0:
  + See https://blog.kitware.com/vtk-7-0-0/ for a detailed
    article describing all the changes in this version.
- Add vtk-Rinterface-uintptr_t.patch to fix building: uintptr_t
  is already defined in the R headers, uintptr_t definition in
  <stdint.h> conflicts with the R definition and causes builds to
  fail. This patch fixes the problem by commenting out the call
  to include stdint.h (it was only being used for this solitary
  symbol).
- Use python 3 for building, rename python- subpackages
  accordingly to python3-.
- Update file lists in accordance with added/dropped binaries
  upstream; affects vtk-examples, vtk-devel.
- Drop conditionals referencing outdated openSUSE version 12.3.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun 22 18:00:32 UTC 2015 - olaf@aepfle.de

- Add libxml2-devel/netcdf-devel/libnetcdf_c++-devel Requires to vtk-devel

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr  8 19:57:31 UTC 2015 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Add jsoncpp-devel Requires to vtk-devel (for openSUSE > 13.2):
  vtkjsoncpp.cmake has
  set(vtkjsoncpp_LIBRARIES "/usr/lib64/libjsoncpp.so").

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 13 19:50:12 UTC 2015 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Update to version 6.2.0:
  + See http://www.kitware.com/blog/home/post/858 for a list of
    changes.
- Drop patches incorporated upstream:
  + vtk-install-missing-modules.patch
  + vtk-Mesa10.3-build-failures.patch
  + vtk-system.patch.
- Update filelist to incorporate new files installed by upstream.
- Use system hdf5 and netcdf on all openSUSE versions.
- Build on openSUSE > 13.2 with system libraries ON (except
  for libproj4); all required depndencies for this purpose are
  now in Factory.
- Add rpmlintrc file to suppress
  "devel-files-in-non-devel-package" warning; python-vtk needs
  these devel files for its own functioning.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb 26 12:30:11 UTC 2015 - dkxls23@gmail.com

- Add MPI support

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 11 01:52:56 UTC 2014 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Add vtk-Mesa10.3-build-failures.patch to workaround build
  failures when compiling against Mesa >= 10.3; patch taken from
  upstream git and rebased; applied only for openSUSE >= 13.2.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan 24 20:44:24 UTC 2014 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Update to version 6.1.0:
  + See http://www.kitware.com/news/home/browse/502 for a list of
    changes
- Rebase patches:
  + vtk-system.patch
  + vtk-install-missing-modules.patch
- Packaging changes:
  + Re-enable R bindings for 13.1 and above
  + Turn off building test modules for now as it leads to build
    issues (DBUILD_TESTING:BOOL=OFF)
  + Turn off usage of system libraries for now
    (DVTK_USE_SYSTEM_LIBRARIES:BOOL=OFF), as usage of system
    libraries now introduces dependency on json-cpp which is not
    available for openSUSE (yet)
  + Python modules are now installed by vtk's cmake script;
    hence, pass system python dirs to cmake by using cmake
    variable DVTK_INSTALL_PYTHON_MODULE_DIR instead of
    DVTK_PYTHON_SETUP_ARGS used previously
  + vtkpython is now installed by cmake script automatically;
    hence remove the manual copying to /usr/bin used earlier
  + Python libraries are now stripped automatically on install;
    chrpath no longer needed on these
  + Python object files are now installed in
    %python_sitearch
  + Skip examples no longer installed as a result of test modules
    being turned off
  + Install new binaries (mkg3states) and bundled data files
    (/usr/share/vtk-6.1)
  + Cleanup spec file:
    - Remove support for EOL openSUSE versions (12.1 and earlier)
      by dropping appropriate conditionals
    - Fix minor formatting issues.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul 19 02:52:28 UTC 2013 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Disable R bindings for Factory, since it causes weird build
  failures in openSUSE:Factory, (strangely no failures in devel
  project) until the reason behind the failure is found and fixed. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun 28 13:41:09 UTC 2013 - badshah400@gmail.com

    handle resource exhaustion
  + Fix compilation on FreeBSD operating system
  + A handful of fixes in VTK's Qt interface kit

  anyway - added a note about it).
- Removed build time references so build-compare can do its work.
- Compile the package out-of-source.
- Use the generic "VTK_USE_SYSTEM_LIBRARIES" cmake variable for enabling the
  use of system libraries instead of doing it with a per package variable.
