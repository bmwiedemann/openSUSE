  <title>A kernel module to create V4L2 loopback devices</title>
  <description>This module allows you to create &quot;virtual video devices&quot; normal (v4l2)
applications will read these devices as if they were ordinary video
devices, but the video will not be read from e.g. a capture card but
instead it is generated by another application.
