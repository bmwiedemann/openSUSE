- systemd versions prior to 244 do not support the ProtectXYZ
  directives we use in our vsftpd.service file and log warnings
  every time the daemon starts, which confuses our users. We avoid
  this issue by removing the unsupported options from the service
  file when installing on a distribution that comes with such an
  older version of systemd. [bsc#1196918]

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 15 11:00:54 UTC 2022 - Stefan Schubert <schubi@localhost>

- Migration to /usr/etc: Saving user changed configuration files
  in /etc and restoring them while an RPM update.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug 25 08:23:08 UTC 2022 - Peter Simons <psimons@suse.com>

- Apply "disable-tls13-to-support-older-openssl-versions.patch"
  when building on SLE-15. This is necessary, because openssl_1_1
  on that codestream is version 1.1.0 rather than 1.1.1 and that
  older version has no TLSv1.3 support. [bsc#1187686]

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun 29 13:53:16 UTC 2022 - Stefan Schubert <schubi@suse.com>

- When building on Tumbleweed, move logrotate files from user
  specific directory /etc/logrotate.d to vendor specific directory
  /usr/etc/logrotate.d. Builds on other codestreams still use the
  original location.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar  3 16:44:28 UTC 2022 - Peter Simons <psimons@suse.com>

- Use rpm conditional to build against the proper OpenSSL version
  on all distributions. This allows us to update vsftpd in all
  maintained SLE codestreams to the current Factory version and
  mitigate the newly discovered ALPACA attack. [jsc#SLE-24275,
  jsc#PM-3322, bsc#1187686]

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb  1 18:42:41 UTC 2022 - Peter Simons <psimons@suse.com>

- Add "seccomp-fixes.patch" to fix the syscall architecture offset
  from 4 to 5, this change was documented in
  <https://lore.kernel.org/patchwork/patch/554803/>.

- Add "vsftpd-openlog-force.patch" to a logic error in the way the
  force option for syslog's openlog() call was handled.

- Add "vsftpd-seccomp-getrandom.patch" to fix a seccomp failure in
  FIPS mode when SSL was enabled. [bsc#1052900]

- Add "vsftpd-seccomp-ssl.patch" to allow stat() to be called,
  which is required during SSL initialization by RAND_load_file().

- Add "vsftpd-seccomp-wait4.patch" to allow wait4() to be called so
  that the broker can wait for its child processes. [bsc#1021387]

- Refresh patches to -p1 style so that we can use %autosetup:
  * vsftpd-2.0.4-dmapi.patch
  * vsftpd-2.0.4-enable-ssl.patch
  * vsftpd-2.0.5-enable-debuginfo.patch
  * vsftpd-2.0.5-utf8-log-names.patch
  * vsftpd-2.0.5-vuser.patch
  * vsftpd-2.3.5-conf.patch

- Apply "revert-undocumented-config-file-format-changes.patch" to
  revert the "ssl_tlsv1_X"-style config file options back to their
  original spelling. The changes that dropped the underscore from
  the version numbers in release 3.0.4 breaks existing
  configurations and it was never documented anywhere -- not in the
  package's changelog and not in the packages's own man page.

- Apply "use-system-wide-tls-cipher-policy.patch" so that vsftpd
  follows the system-wide TLS cipher policy "DEFAULT_SUSE" by
  default. Run the command "openssl ciphers -v DEFAULT_SUSE" to see
  which ciphers this includes.

- Apply "vsftpd-allow-dev-log-socket.patch" to allow sendto()
  syscall when /dev/log support is enabled. [bnc#786024]

- Apply "vsftpd-enable-sendto-for-prelogin-syslog.patch" to allow
  sendto() to be called from check_limits(), which is necessary for
  vsftpd to write to the system log.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan  5 10:21:02 UTC 2022 - Johannes Segitz <jsegitz@suse.com>

- Added hardening to systemd service(s) (bsc#1181400). Modified:
  * vsftpd.service

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep 10 13:15:44 UTC 2021 - Fabian Vogt <fvogt@suse.com>

- Update to version 3.0.5:
  * Fix ALPN callback to correctly select the 'ftp' string if present.
    Works with FileZilla-3.55.0.
  * Fix a couple of seccomp policy issues with Fedora 34.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun 15 07:49:13 AM UTC 2021 - Peter Simons <psimons@suse.com>

- Update to version 3.0.4.
  * Fix runtime SIGSYS crashes (seccomp sandbox policy tweaks).
  * Reject HTTP verbs pre-login.
  * Disable TLS prior to v1.2 by default.
  * Close the control connection after 10 unknown commands pre-login.
  * Reject any TLS ALPN advertisement that's not 'ftp'.
  * Add ssl_sni_hostname option to require a match on incoming SNI hostname.
  * The options "ssl_tlsv1_1", "ssl_tlsv1_2", and "ssl_tlsv1_3"
    have been renamed to "ssl_tlsv11", "ssl_tlsv12", and
    "ssl_tlsv13" respectively. Note that the man page has not been
    updated accordingly.

- Upstream has a new GPG key (7B89011BCAE1CFEA).

- "0001-Introduce-TLSv1.1-and-TLSv1.2-options.patch" is now obsolete.

- "0001-Introduce-TLSv1.3-option.patch" is now obsolete.

- "vsftpd-seccomp-syslog.patch" is now obsolete.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun 14 14:26:05 UTC 2021 - Peter Simons <psimons@suse.com>

- OpenSSL was updated to version 1.1.1 in SLE-15-SP2, adding
  support for the TLSv1.3 protocol. As a consequence, some SLE-15
  applications that link OpenSSL for TLS support -- like vsftpd --,
  gained the ability to use the newer TLS protocol, which created
  interoperability problems with FTP clients in some cases. To
  remedy the situation, "0001-Introduce-TLSv1.3-option.patch" was
  applied in a forked SLE-15-SP2 version of vsftpd. The patch adds
  the configuration option "ssl_tlsv1_3" that system administrators
  can use to disable TLSv1.3 support on their servers.
  [bsc#1187188]

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec  3 11:20:20 UTC 2020 - Ismail Dönmez <idonmez@suse.com>

- Add seccomp-fixes.patch to allow getdents64 syscall in seccomp
  sandbox, fixes bsc#1179553
  Also in the same patch, fix the architecture offset from 4 to 5,
  this change was documented in https://lore.kernel.org/patchwork/patch/554803/

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov 13 09:49:06 AM UTC 2020 - psimons@suse.com

- Apply "0001-Introduce-TLSv1.1-and-TLSv1.2-options.patch" and
  "0001-When-handling-FEAT-command-check-ssl_tlsv1_1-and-ssl.patch",
  which add the "ssl_tlsv1_1" and "ssl_tlsv1_2" options to the
  configuration file. Both options default to true. [SLE-4182]

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug 19 09:46:05 UTC 2020 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Use %{_prefix}/lib instead of misused %{_libexecdir}.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec  5 14:04:59 UTC 2019 - Josef Möllers <josef.moellers@suse.com>

- Add pam_keyinit.so to PAM config file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun 18 15:37:38 UTC 2019 - Peter Simons <psimons@suse.com>

- Apply "vsftpd-avoid-bogus-ssl-write.patch" to fix a segmentation
  fault that occurred while trying to write to an invalid TLS
  context. [bsc#1125951]

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun 12 14:16:40 UTC 2019 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct 23 22:05:43 UTC 2018 - Christian Boltz <suse-beta@cboltz.de>

- firewall-macros should be BuildRequires, not Requires(post)
  (the macro gets expanded during package build)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun 28 15:57:13 UTC 2018 - psimons@suse.com

- Extend "vsftpd-3.0.3-address_space_limit.patch" to mention the
  new 'address_space_limit' option in the installed vsftpd.conf(5)
  man page. [bsc#1075060]

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun 21 11:06:33 UTC 2018 - psimons@suse.com

- Apply "vsftpd-support-dsa-only-setups.patch" to disable the
  problematic default setting for rsa_cert_file. Upstream
  initializes that value to "/usr/share/ssl/certs/vsftpd.pem" and
  vsftpd won't start up if that file does not exist (or if it does
  not contain an RSA certificate). Therefore, users who copy a DSA
  certificate into that location or properly configure a DSA
  certificate via dsa_cert_file without explicitly disabling the
  RSA certificate won't be able to start vsftpd. [bsc#975538]

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 16 15:25:02 UTC 2018 - psimons@suse.com

- Don't start/stop parameterized systemd units in pre/post actions.
  These units cannot be used without an explicit parameter and
  attempts to do so lead to a confusing "failed to try-restart"
  error message. [bsc#1093179, bsc#1010177]

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr 25 06:32:25 UTC 2018 - psimons@suse.com

- vsftpd-enable-syscalls-needed-by-sle15.patch: Enable wait4(),
  sysinfo(), and shutdown() syscalls in seccomp sandbox. These are
  required for the daemon to work properly on SLE-15. [bsc#1089088,
  bsc#1180314]

- Make sure to also require group nobody and user ftp bsc#1070653

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep  7 12:24:26 UTC 2017 - psimons@suse.com

- Add "vsftpd-die-with-session.patch" to fix a bug in vsftpd that
  would cause SSL protocol errors, aborting the connection, whenever
  system errors occurred that were supposed to be non-fatal.
  [bsc#1044292]

- Add "vsftpd-mdtm-in-utc.patch" to fix interoperability issue with
  various ftp clients that arose when vsftpd is configured with
  option "use_localtime=YES". Basically, it's fine to use local time
  stamps in directory listings, but responding to MDTM commands with
  any time zone other than UTC directly violates RFC3659 and leads
  FTP clients to misinterpret the file's time stamp. [bsc#1024961]

- Add "vsftpd-append-seek-pipe.patch" to allow the FTP server to
  append to a file system pipe. [bsc#1048427]

- Add "vsftpd-3.0.3-address_space_limit.patch" to create the new
  configuration option "address_space_limit", which determines the
  memory limit vsftpd configures for its own process (given in
  bytes). The previously hard-coded limit (100 MB) may not be
  sufficient for vsftpd servers running with certain PAM modules
  enabled, and in such cases administrators may wish to raise the
  limit to match their system's requirements. [bsc#1042137]

- Don't rely on the vsf_findlibs.sh script to figure out the list
  of libraries the build needs to link. The script is wildly
  unreliable and it's hard to predict what results it will produce.
  Also, the results it *does* produce are invisble in the build
  log. We stumbled across this issue when vsftpd suddendly had
  build failures on i586 platforms because the script decided to
  try and link "-lnsl" even though the library was neither
  installed nor required.

- Drop the explicit specification of the LDFLAGS and LINK variables
  from the call to make. The value of LDFLAGS we passed is the
  default anyway and giving LINK has no effect since it's not used
  anywhere in the Makefile.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun 14 11:42:26 UTC 2017 - tchvatal@suse.com

  * Remove the trailing period from EPSV response to work around BT Internet
    issues; report from Tim Bishop <tdb@mirrorservice.org>.
  * Fix syslog_enable issues vs. seccomp filtering. Report from Michal Vyskocil
    <mvyskocil@suse.cz>. At least, syslogging seems to work on my Fedora now.
  * Allow gettimeofday() in the seccomp sandbox. I can't repro failures, but I
    probably have a different distro / libc / etc. and there are multiple reports.
  * Some kernels support PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS but not PR_SET_SECCOMP, so handle
    this case gracefully. Report from Vasily Averin <vvs@odin.com>.
  * List the TLS1.2 cipher AES128-GCM-SHA256 as first preference by default.
  * Make some compile-time SSL defaults (such as correct client shutdown
    handling) stricter.
  * Disable Nagle algorithm during SSL data connection shutdown, to avoid 200ms
    delays. From Tim Kosse <tim.kosse@filezilla-project.org>.
  * Kill the FTP session if we see HTTP protocol commands, to avoid
    cross-protocol attacks. A report from Jann Horn <jann@thejh.net>.
  * Kill the FTP session if we see session re-use failure. A report from
    Tim Kosse <tim.kosse@filezilla-project.org>.
  * Enable ECDHE, Tim Kosse <tim.kosse@filezilla-project.org>.
  * Default cipher list is now just ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384.
  * Minor SSL logging improvements.
  * Un-default tunable_strict_ssl_write_shutdown again. We still have
    tunable_strict_ssl_read_eof defaulted now, which is the important one to prove
    upload integrity.

  * Seccomp filter sandbox: missing munmap() -- oops. Did you know that qsort()
  opens and maps /proc/meminfo but only for larger item counts?
  * Seccomp filter sandbox: deny socket() gracefully for text_userdb_names.
  * Fix various NULL crashes with nonsensical config settings. Noted by Tianyin
  Xu <tixu@cs.ucsd.edu>.
  * Force cast to unsigned char in is* char functions.
  * Fix harmless integer issues in strlist.c.
  * Started on a (possibly ill-advised?) crusade to compile cleanly with
  Wconversion. Decided to suspend the effort half-way through.
  * One more seccomp policy fix: mremap (denied).
  * Support STOU with no filename, uses a STOU. prefix.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug 24 07:07:55 UTC 2012 - mvyskocil@suse.cz

- make seccomp sandbox enabled by default
  * dropped vsftpd-3.0.0-turn-seccomp-sandbox-off.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr 23 10:38:40 UTC 2012 - brian@aljex.com

- fix building on 11.4 x86_64 and lower
  * fix where, when, & how __USE_GNU gets #defined
  * make seccomp optional and disable it on 10.3 and lower

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr 10 14:13:12 UTC 2012 - mvyskocil@suse.cz

- update to upstream 3.0.0:
  * Make listen mode the default.
  * Fix missing "const" in ssl.c
  * Add seccompsandbox.c to support a seccomp filter sandbox; works against
    Ubuntu 12.04 ABI.
  * Rearrange ftppolicy.c a bit so the syscall list is easily comparable with
    seccompsandbox.c
  * Rename deprecated "sandbox" to "ptrace_sandbox".
  * Add a few more state checks to the privileged helper processes.
  * Add tunable "seccomp_sandbox", default on.
  * Use hardened build flags.
  * Retry creating a PASV socket upon port reuse race between bind() and
    listen(), patch from Ralph Wuerthner <ralph.wuerthner@de.ibm.com>.
  * Don't die() if recv() indicates a closed remote connection. Problem report
    on a Windows client from Herbert van den Bergh,
    <herbert.van.den.bergh@oracle.com>.
  * Add new config setting "allow_writeable_chroot" to help people in a bit of
    a spot with the v2.3.5 defensive change. Only applies to non-anonymous.
  * Remove a couple of fixed things from BUGS.
  * strlen() trunction fix -- no particular impact.
  * Apply some tidyups from mmoufid@yorku.ca.
  * Fix delete_failed_uploads if there is a timeout. Report from Alejandro
    Hernández Hdez <aalejandrohdez@gmail.com>.
  * Fix other data channel bugs such as failure to log failure upon timeout.
  * Use exit codes a bit more consistently.
  * Fix bad interaction between SSL and trans_chunk_size.
  * Redo data timeout to fire properly for SSL sessions.
  * Redo idle timeout to fire properly for SSL sessions.
  * Make sure PROT_EXEC isn't allowed, thanks to Will Drewry for noticing.
  * Use 10 minutes as a max linger time just in case an alarm gets lost.
  * Change PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS define, from Kees Cook.
  * Add AES128-SHA to default SSL cipher suites for FileZilla compatibility.
    Unfortunately the default vsftpd SSL confiuration still doesn't fully work with
    FileZilla, because FileZilla has a data connection security problem: no client
    certificate presentation and no session reuse. At least the error message is
    now very clear.
  * Add restart_syscall to seccomp policy. Triggers reliably if you strace whilst
    a data transfer is in progress.
  * Fix delete_failed_uploads for anonymous sessions.
  * Don't listen for urgent data if the control connection is SSL, due to possible
    protocol synchronization issues.
- SUSE specific changes:
  * turn off the listen mode (listen=NO) by default and change README.SUSE
  * merge new hardended flags for build and linking
  * fix the wrong Type=forking from systemd service file
  * turn off the seccomp_sandbox off by default as SUSE kernel does not support
    it (yet)

    <martin@meltin.net>.
  * Some simple fixes and cleanups from Thorsten Brehm <tbrehm@dspace.de>.
  * Only advertise "AUTH SSL" if one of SSLv2, SSLv3 is enabled. Thanks to
    steve willing <eiji-gravion@hotmail.com>.
  * Handle connect() failures properly. Thanks to Takayuki Nagata
    <tnagata@redhat.com>.
  * Add stronger checks for the configuration error of running with a
    writeable root directory inside a chroot(). This may bite people who
    carelessly turned on chroot_local_user but such is life.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug 10 04:55:16 UTC 2010 - cristian.rodriguez@opensuse.org

- Update to 2.3.0
- Add extremely simply HTTP support. It's very experimental, ignorant of HTTP
protocol and headers, and likely has all sorts of other issues. The use case
it might satisfy is if you need to serve simple static unathenticated content
with large levels of paranoia.
- Fix port_promiscuous breakage.
- Minor FAQ update.
- Use a larger address space limit if using text_userdb_names=YES
- Always use CLONE_NEWNET if possible when in HTTP mode.
- Change REST + STOR so that it's possible to overwrite part of file without
truncating it.
- Boot the session if we see a USER where encryption was required. May prevent
the transmission of plaintext passwords by buggy clients.
- Fix failure to transmit a large ASCII file over SSL, if it contains \n -> \r\n
fixups.

	clients. Thanks Holger Kiehl <Holger.Kiehl@dwd.de>.
  * Fix erroneous "child died" upon FTP client connect, when under load. Awesome
	thanks to Holger Kiehl <Holger.Kiehl@dwd.de> for running diagnostic tests on
	his live server.
  * Boot the session if an overly long line is encountered.

- version 2.0.6
- Fix delay_failed_login typo. Oops.
- Patch the getcwd and readlink sysutil helpers to reflect that they wouldn't
like a 0-sized buf. No caller is affected. Thanks Ilja van Sprundel
<ilja@suresec.org>.
- Allow a (fake) reauth as the same user as the logged in user. Should resolve
.NET related report from Sabo Jim <Jim.Sabo@thomson.net>.
- Tweak from Lucian Adrian Grijincu <lucian.grijincu@gmail.com> to take
unnecessary port calculations out of a loop.
- Fix byte I/O accounting in the error path of do_file_send_rwloop, thanks to

Marcin Zawadzki/GlobalVanet.com <marcin.zawadzki@globalvanet.com>.
- Pretend we have proper UTF8 support and respond positively to OPTS UTF8 ON.
Thanks Stanislav Maslovski <stanislav.maslovski@gmail.com>.
- Add control over the file permissions used in the chown()ing of anonymous
uploads: chown_upload_mode (default 0600 as before). Suggestion from
An Pham <apham@medforcetech.com>.
- Do a retry getting the active ftp socket in vsf_privop_get_ftp_port_sock();
should help buggy Solaris systems. Reported by Michael Masterson
<mjmasterson@xo.com>.
- Add debug_ssl option to dump out some SSL connection details.
- Use code 522, not 521, to indicate that the server requires an encrypted
data connection. Still does not seem to coax lftp to retry :(
- Recognize OPTS pre-login.
- A whole ton of SSL improvements, including ability to force requirement of
a client cert; data and control channel client cert cross checking. Ability
to require fully valid / authentic client certs. No cert-based auth yet.

- enable ssl for real [#151453]

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb  6 14:31:27 CET 2006 - hvogel@suse.de

- The switch to standalone should not happen in update.
  Installed xinetd config file again. The configuration file is
  marked as noreplace anyway so if you are updating you will
  get a xinetd.d/vsftpd.rpmnew and a vsftpd.conf.rpmnew
  and everything is working as before and standalone is only used
  for new installations. [#148201]
- redirect standalone parent output to /var/log/rcvsftp.log
  so the init script can return properly.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan 25 21:42:43 CET 2006 - mls@suse.de

Wed Jan 11 12:11:52 CET 2006 - hvogel@suse.de

- Update to version 2.0.4 including:

 o Add explicit "This FTP server does not allow anonymous logins"
   message.
 o Add paranoid checks to sysutil.c for large values / lengths.
 o Load per-IP config files earlier; allows more settings to be
   tuned on a per-IP level.
 o regex fix so that {*} correctly matches everything.
 o Add optional file locking support via lock_upload_files.
 o Apply LDFLAGS patch from Mads Martin Joergensen <mmj@suse.de>.
 o Add pasv_addr_resolve option to allow pasv_address to get
   DNS resolved once at startup.
 o Apply patch to fix timezone issues (caused by chroot()
   interacting badly with newer glibc versions).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 28 18:47:15 CEST 2005 - mmj@suse.de

- Compile with -fpie, link with -pie

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr 19 16:39:52 CEST 2005 - mmj@suse.de

- Update to 2.0.3 including:
  o Document what regex expressions are supported in the man page.
  o New settings rsa_private_key_file and dsa_private_key_file to
    allow separate files for the certificates and private keys.
  o Initial, simple fix for timed out processes not exiting when
    SSL is in use.  Better fix (which reports timeout to client
    properly) to follow.
  o Add which setsockopt option failed to die("setsockopt") calls.
  o Fix error with IPv4 connections to IPv6 listeners and PORT
    type data connections when connect_from_port_20 is set.
  o Remove vsf_sysutil_sockaddr_same_family (unused).
  o Support protocol 1 (IPv4) in EPRT.
  o Add ssl.c to AUDIT.
  o Allow config file to use "ssl_ciphers=" to use default
    OpenSSL cipher list.
  o Allow "EPSV 1" to mean IPv4 EPSV.
  o Report dummy IP but correct port with IPv6 / PASV.
  o Handle SSL_WANT_READ and SSL_WANT_WRITE retries in SSL_read
    and SSL_write; fixes SSL upload failures when data timeouts are
    in use with some clients.
  o Implicitly disable connect_from_port_20 and chown_uploads
    when a non-root user is using run_as_launching_user.
  o Add force_anon_logins_ssl and force_anon_data_ssl for a fully
    SSL secure anonymous  oonly solution (useful when you don't
    have root access and a range of acceptable anonymous
    passwords as credentials).
  o Use SSL BIO callbacks to fix data connection timeout checks;
    the checks weren't all occurring promply.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar  3 09:35:27 CET 2005 - mmj@suse.de

- Update to 2.0.2 including:
  o Emit data transfer status messages (success / failure)
    after flushing and waiting for the full data transfer to
    reach the client. This should help work around buggy FTP
    clients such as FlashFXP, which is known to truncate files
    incorrectly.
  o Make str_empty actually allocate an empty string.
  o Change the ASCII receive code to ONLY rip out \r if it is
    just before a \n; someone finally complained about this.
  o Enable AIX Large File Support
  o Add a couple of FAQ entries.
  o Fix time delta code areas to cope with negative deltas,
    which will occur if the clock is adjusted backwards.
  o Fix "errno" checks to be robust in multiple places;
    previously, calls to failing library calls could be made
    inbetween the original library call and the "errno" reads.
  o Make bandwidth limiter work with SSL data connections.
  o Note that the SSL / bandwidth limiter bug fixed a much more
    serious bug: SSL data connection dropouts after
    data_connection_timeout seconds.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb 18 10:48:48 CET 2005 - mmj@suse.de

- Glibc doesn't cache the timezone as much as it used to, so export
  the TZ variable after doing chroot. [#49878]

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug 12 11:26:26 CEST 2004 - mmj@suse.de

- Update to 2.0.1 including:
  o Add -lcrypto for the SSL build; needed for some systems
  o Oops; fix session bale out if an empty length password is given.
  o Fix build on Fedora Core 2 (-lcap cannot seem to find /lib/libcap.so).
  o Fix vsftpd.conf.5 man page error in "ssl_sslv3"
  o Clarify licensing: I allow linking of my GPL software with the OpenSSL
    libraries.
  o Fix build where PAM build is enabled but PAM headers are missing.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul  2 12:35:51 CEST 2004 - mmj@suse.de

- Update to 2.0.0 including:
  o Improve logging (log deletes, renames, chmods, etc. as
    requested by users).
  o Add no_log_lock to work around Solaris / Veritas locking
    hangs.
  o Add EPRT, EPSV, PASV and TVFS to FEAT response.
  o Implement use of MDTM to set timestamps.
  o Recognize FEAT prior to login.
  o Add OpenSSL (AUTH TLS / SSL) support for encrypted control
    and data connections.
  o Increase max size of .message files to 4000 characters
  o Add easy builddefs.h ability to disable PAM builds even when
    PAM is installed.
  o Report vsftpd version in STAT output.
  o Add REFS file.
  o Change parent<->child socket comms from DGRAM to STREAM for
    increased reliability. The main benefit is should the parent
    be killed (or crash out) then the child won't block on a
    read() that will never return.
  o Make str_reserve reserve space for the trailing zero as well,
    so we don't cause a reallocation if we exactly fill the buffer.
  o Optimize the sending of strings over the parent<->child comms links.
  o Improve the build system so tcp_wrappers, PAM and OpenSSL can
    be forcibly compiled out.
  o Fix vsftpd.conf.5 typos
  o If trans_chunk_size is between 1 and 4096, use 4096 rather
    than ignoring totally.
  o Add SSL / TLS info to SECURITY texts.
  o Add README.ssl
  o Add documentation for new SSL options to vsftpd.conf.5.
  o Add support for CWD ~
  o Fix compile warnings.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun May 30 01:35:55 CEST 2004 - mmj@suse.de

- Add logrotate file [#41432]

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr 27 10:15:24 CEST 2004 - mmj@suse.de

- Update to 1.2.2 including:
  o Fix nasty issue resulting in listener instability under
    extreme load (root cause was re-entering malloc/free).
  o Fix build with modern glibc-2.3 and no libcap on Linux.
  o Add initial support for running as the user which launched
    vsftpd, i.e. no root needed. Warning - easy to create
    insecurity if you use this without knowing what you are
    doing.
  o For above run-as-launching-user support: make CDUP re-use CWD
    code so that deny_file of *..* is useful.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 26 14:08:28 CET 2004 - hvogel@suse.de
