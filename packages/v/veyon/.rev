    <comment>- Update to version 4.6.0.
  * Core
    * Protocol errors during the initial authentication phase are
      handled more reliably. This fixes problems when connecting to
      incompatible servers accidentally.
  * CLI
    * The plugin and feature modules have been added.
    * The config and shell plugins have been integrated as static
      modules.
  * Plugins
    * Demo: The visual feedback when (re-)connecting has been
      redesigned.
    * DesktopServices: The Run program feature has been renamed to
      Start application.
    * RemoteAccess: The visual feedback when (re-)connecting has
      been redesigned.
    * RemoteAccess: The computer connection of the main window is
      reused if available resulting in immediate access to the remote
      computer.
    * RemoteAccess: The remote cursor is no longer used in view
      only mode to prevent occasionally observed render artifacts.
    * UserSessionControl: Non-user sessions (such as display
      manager/login screen sessions) are no longer terminated by the
      user logoff feature.
    * WebAPI: An error code has been added to report protocol
      errors occuring while connecting to the Veyon Server.
    * WebAPI: The connection limit is enforced at the HTTP server
      level already to properly report the connection limit reached
      error instead of timing out.
    * WebAPI: Skip ping for hosts which no connection could be
      established to. This allows using a higher connection limit
      on Linux when the number of open file descriptors is limited.
  * Master
    * In addition to the hostname, the computer display name is
      shown in the tooltip of a computer.
    * A computer's screen is shown in fullscreen and realtime while
      pressing and holding the left mouse button on a computer.
    * For Linux clients, [no user] is displayed as the user name
      instead of the name of the display manager user.
  * Server
    * Hostnames of connected computers
      (shown in the tooltip of the tray icon) are now reverse
      resolved in background to keep connections responsive.
  * Linux
    * SHM support is being detected more reliably.
    * Logging off users is now initiated properly through the
      environment-specific session manager while systemd-logind
      is used as fallback only. This fixes the display manager
      (especially GDM3) not being shown again after logoff.
    * Reboot and power down via systemd-logind has been improved
      while the environment-specific session manager is used as
      fallback only. The reboot and poweroff binaries are not usedany longer.
- Update to version 4.5.7.
  * Core: allow minus characters in authentication key name
  * Linux: x11vnc: auto-detect SHM support – fixes server crashing
    on start in case of lacking SHM support (no need to manually
    configure -noshm as extra parameter any longer)
  * Linux: fix Veyon session ID detection in case desktop session
    path and ID do not match – fixes occasionally broken multi
    session support
  * WebAPI: improve TLS-related error messages

    <comment>- Update to version 4.7.0.
  * Core
    * Fixed binary compatibility issues between different versions
      of LibVNCServer/LibVNCClient.
    * Messages in log files (especially debug messages) are now
      much more human readable.
  * Plugins
    * Demo: Screens in the Demo menu are now displayed with their
      actual hardware name and connector type/index.
    * LDAP: Fixed querying members of a group when the nested
      groups option is enabled.
    * TextMessage: Students can now select and copy the text
      message or parts of it.
    * TextMessage: Rich text
      (i.e. formatted text including hyperlinks) can now be
      entered and sent to students.
    * RemoteAccess: For remote computers with multiple screens, a
      button with a screen selection menu has been added.
    * RemoteAccess: The login name of the remote user is shown in
      the window title, if the full name is not available.
    * WebAPI: The header field lookup (e.g. for the connection UID)
      is now case insensitive.
  * Linux
    * The parameter order for the ping utility has been improved.
    * Issues regarding the session identification have been fixed,
      solving various issues when running veyon-server manually
      e.g. via autostart entries.
  * Master
    * A regression in Veyon 4.6.0 has been fixed to make the
      computer and user search case insensitive again.
    * Control messages between computers are now sent asynchronously
      which improves performance and responsiveness while reducing
      the CPU load.
    * When closing the program, it now stops all features on the
      student computers and waits until all corresponding control
      messages have been sent.
    * A new filter button has been added to show computers with
      logged on users only.
    * The dialog for confirming actions such as powering off
      computers only emphasizes ALL computers if all computers are
      selected.
    * If available, the full name of the user is now preferred in
      the tooltip.
  * Server
    * Server-side framebuffer update rate control has been added
      which improves performance and responsive.
