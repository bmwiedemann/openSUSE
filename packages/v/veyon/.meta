  <title>Free and Open Source computer monitoring and classroom management</title>
  <description>Veyon is a free and Open Source software for computer monitoring and classroom
management supporting Windows and Linux. It enables teachers to view and
control computer labs and interact with students. Veyon is available in
different languages and provides lots of useful features:

* see what's going on in computer labs in overview mode and take screenshots
* remote control computers to support and help users
* broadcast teacher's screen to students in realtime by using demo mode 
  (either in fullscreen or in a window)
* lock workstations for attracting attention to teacher
* send text messages to students
* powering on/off and rebooting computers remote
* remote logoff and remote execution of arbitrary commands/scripts
* home schooling - Veyon's network technology is not restricted to a subnet 
  and therefore students at home can join lessons via VPN connections just 
  by installing the Veyon service
