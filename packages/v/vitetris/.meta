  <title>Terminal-based Tetris clone</title>
  <description>Vitetris is a terminal-based Tetris game. It can be played by one or
two players, over the network or on the same keyboard.

Vitetris comes with more features and options than might be expected
from a simple text mode game. Full input control, customizable
appearance, netplay where both players can choose difficulty (level
and height) -- unless you must have sound (or just don't like Tetris),
you won't be disappointed.

Rotation, scoring, levels and speed should resemble the early Tetris
games by Nintendo, with the addition of a short lock delay which
makes it possible to play at higher levels. (It does not make it
possible to prevent the piece from ever locking by abusing lock delay
resets.)
