  <title>A Gtk3 desktop panel based on Vala</title>
  <description>Vala Panel is a desktop panel written in Vala and Gtk3.
Initially it was a fork of LXPanel but 0.2.0 is completely rewritten in Vala.
It offers same functionality as LXPanel but:
 * It has a slightly bigger memory usage.
 * X11 dependency is stripped from panel core (but it is not tested on another display servers, such as Wayland and Mir, right now).
 * Some of former LXPanel plugins are separate binaries now and live in another packages (volume applet for example).</description>
