- Update to version 1.0.3:
  * Fix bug in difference() for rapidjson
  * Tidy up regex changes
  * Ability to customize regular expression engine
  * Compatibility with boost-1.85.0
  * README.md: Fix un-escaped underscore characters and typo.
  * updated examples/valijson_nlohmann_bundled.hpp
  * Various fixes, reducing compiler warnings.
  * Implemented Schema and Subschema move constructor and
    assignment operators. Default implementations were not
    sufficient, since raw pointers are not actually moved correctly
    automatically, resulting in segmentation faults.
  * Added explicit default move constructor/operator to Schema and
    Subschema to enable move semantics for these classes
