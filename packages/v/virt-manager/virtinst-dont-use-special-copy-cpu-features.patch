References: bsc#1067018 - L3: KVM Guest creation failed - Property .cmt not found

Some hardware has the .cmt cpu feature but qemu doesn't support it. libvirt
includes it in the cpu capabilities read in by virt-manager. Using 'host-model'
was known to have issues in the past and so a copy method was set up to
manually copy cpu features one at a time (including the unsupported cmt flag).
This patch simply avoids the special copy feature when "Copy host CPU definition"
is set in the Preferences -> New VM -> CPU Default pop-up menu and falls
back to using 'host-model'.

It should be noted that selecting "Customize configuration before install"
and "CPUs" -> "Copy host CPU definition" also inserts 'host-model' so
this change mirrors what is already done there.
