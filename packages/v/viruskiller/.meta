  <title>Arcade shoot 'em up game about virus invasion</title>
  <description>Your computer has been invaded! Dozens of little viruses are pouring
in via security holes in Microsoft Internet Explorer, Microsoft Outlook,
Microsoft MSN Messenger and Microsoft Recycle Bin!! Using your trusty
mouse you must shoot the buggers before they can destroy your files!
Some will steal them from their home directories and take them back
to their security hole. Others will just eat them right there on
the spot! See how long you and your computer can survive the onslaught!</description>
