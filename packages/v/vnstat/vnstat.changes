  Fixed
  * Image output of 5 minute graph wasn't possible if data
    retention of the 5 minute time period was configured as
    unlimited.
  * Estimates and average rates weren't calculated correctly for
    daily, monthly and yearly time periods when monitoring of the
    interface had been started during the ongoing time period.
  * Estimates weren't being shown in summary output when
    OutputStyle or --style was configured with a value less than 2.

     the possibility of specifying an interface for database queries by using
     its alias instead of system provided interface name, enabled by default
     to support case insensitive matching of the beginning of interface
     aliases (vnstat and vnstati)
   * Image output file extension allows selecting the used image file format
     as long as the used LibGD supports it, PNG is no longer the only option

Sun Nov 28 18:58:54 UTC 2021 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 2.8:
  - Using a combination of --live and --json wasn't flushing stdout after
    each line resulting in buffered output if the output was being piped
  - Image output would fail to show the last line bar graph in list outputs
    if EstimateStyle was 0, BarColumnShowsRate was 1 and the last line had a
    higher traffic rate than other lines
  - Image output didn't correctly horizontally align the "no data available"
    message in 5 minute graph depending on the width of the image
  - Image output related configuration warnings could get shown when image
    output wasn't being used
  - Warnings of mismatches between image output and data retention
    configuration didn't provide relevant details for solving the issues
  - BandwidthDetection was being used for tun interfaces even when the
    Linux kernel had the information hardcoded to 10 Mbit regardless of the
    used real interface, interface specific MaxBW will now be used instead
    or MaxBandwidth as fallback
  - Configured interface specific MaxBW values were getting overridden by
    BandwidthDetection when something could be detected
  - Image output horizontal rx/tx bars often had one pixel too much width in
    the tx section resulting in slightly wrong ratio getting shown
  - Top days list wasn't always sorting entries with exactly the same traffic
    sum using ascending date
  - 64bitInterfaceCounters with value -2 always assumed 32-bit on Linux
    systems until a 64-bit value was seen if kernel headers weren't available
    when binaries were built
  - Add the possibility of specifying an interface without using the
    -i / --iface options (vnstat and vnstati)
  - The daemon can discover added interfaces from the database without
    requiring a restart, configurable with option RescanDatabaseOnSave
  - Add configuration option UseUTC for using UTC as timezone for database
    entries instead of following the system timezone configuration
  - --iflist uses user configured interface specific MaxBW values in the
    output when available instead of showing only the kernel provided
    information when detected
  - Add configuration option AlwaysAddNewInterfaces to expose the daemon
    --alwaysadd command line option which gains an optional mode parameter
  - Image output uses LibGD filled arc bug workaround only for LibGD
    versions that are known to be broken
  - Image output example cgi (examples/vnstat.cgi) improvements
    - Automatically lists all monitored interfaces instead of requiring the
      list to be filled manually, server name in page title comes from
      hostname command by default
    - Provides links for most available images to more detailed or longer
      versions of each image
    - Allows direct interface specific page access with /interfacename suffix
      for the cgi if the used httpd supports PATH_INFO
    - Page auto refresh can be enabled with configurable interval

  * ./configure output could show invalid install paths with some
    parameter combinations.
  * Columns in text hours graph output could get misaligned if the
    selected system locale used a UTF-8 sequence for the thousands
    separator instead of a single character.
  New
  * Add -5g / --fivegraph options to image output with sizing
    related parameters for the output of a 5 minute resolution bar
    graph
  * Add configuration option SummaryGraph and optional parameter
    for --hsummary and --vsummary for selecting which graph is
    shown next to the summary data in the horizontal and vertical
    summary image outputs.
  * Add --large / --small options and configuration option
    LargeFonts for controlling the image output font size.
  * Add --scale and configuration option ImageScale for scaling the
    image output to a given percent.
  * Add configuration option LineSpacingAdjustment for adjusting
    the line spacing of list format image outputs.
  * Add bar visualizations for traffic estimations in image output
  * Allow writing image output to a filename starting with "-".
  * Add --initdb to daemon for creating a new empty database
    without having the daemon process staying running, doesn't
    discard data if a database already exists.
  * Add configuration option BarColumnShowsRate for having the bar
    column in image list outputs be scaled according to the average
    rate column values when those values are visible, disabled by
    default.
  * Add --dbiflist for getting a list of interfaces in the
    database, both --iflist and --dbiflist also get alternative
    more parseable outputs.
  * Add configuration option for large font output and make 5
    minute resolution graph visible in "vnstat.cgi".

- Update to version 2.6
  Fixed
  * --json and --xml didn't support having both mode and limit
    parameters defined at the same time as documented, broken since
    previous release
  * Documentation was using a mix of "count" and "limit" for the
    option of limiting the maximum number of shown entries in
    queries
  * Summary image output would segmentation fault when the database
    existed but didn't yet contain any daily or monthly data for
    the selected interface
  New
  * Add --limit as an alternative way for controlling the length
    of outputs

-------------------------------------------------------------------

    data write which could result in unnecessary errors and even
    process exit if an external database read operation had exactly
    the same timing as the daemon write operation
  * Move vnstatd man page from section 1 to section 8
  New
  * Add --rename for renaming interfaces already existing the
    database

  * Traffic rate wasn't being shown for the last entry of most lists
    during the first update of the next period (first SaveInterval
    minutes of each new hour, day, month and year)
  * Systemd example service file could result in database file write
    issues if the used systemd version supported ProtectSystem=strict
    but didn't support StateDirectory
  * Interfaces could end up staying marked as 'disabled' in the
    database even after becoming back active and monitored, only the
    shown status was wrong without resulting in any data loss
  * Some image outputs didn't allocate enough height for the image
    resulting in the last row having less space below it than intended
  New
  * Automatic interface selection when the Interface configuration
    setting is left empty (new default)
  * Add configuration option DatabaseWriteAheadLogging to enable
    SQLite Write-Ahead Logging mode which may provide some disk i/o
    benefits, see https://www.sqlite.org/wal.html for more details and
    note that SQLite 3.22.0 or later is required to support read-only
    operations
  * Add configuration option DatabaseSynchronous for changing the
    SQLite setting of the "synchronous" flag, see
    https://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_synchronous for more
    details
  * Show warning in log if writing cached data to database is slow
  * Try database query for up to 5 seconds when database is busy or
    locked instead of giving up immediately
  * Continue daemon process execution with data caching if database
    writes fail due to disk being full

  Notes
  * Added clarification to the man page that the 'jsonversion' and
    'xmlversion' fields in the --json and --xml outputs should be seen as
    the API version and compared to the previously used version in 3rd party
    implementations for verifying compatibility
  * Default value of UpdateInterval is now 20 instead of previous 30 seconds

Sun Aug 10 22:15:15 UTC 2014 - chris+dev@any.mx

- removed '-u' parameter from init.d script to actually being able to start the daemon

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul 31 08:57:47 UTC 2013 - cwh@suse.com

- Fixed spec file (removed lost pach files)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jul  7 09:27:29 UTC 2013 - lars@linux-schulserver.de

Mon Feb  4 02:03:00 UTC 2013 - lars@linux-schulserver.de

- update to 1.11:
 * Fix: Memory allocation was miscalculated when creating interface list from
    /sys/class/net when /proc/net/dev wasn't available which in turn could
    crash the daemon
 * Fix: Daemon database cache could remain empty after a -HUP signal
 * Fix: Don't make temp directory in vnstat.cgi writable for everyone
 * Import GNU/kFreeBSD support from Debian
   (#608963, patch by Mats Erik Andersson)
 * Remove usage of GNU only '-D' option for install for BSD in Makefile
 * The daemon now automatically creates databases for available interfaces
   if no databases are found during startup

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb  4 01:58:08 UTC 2013 - lars@linux-schulserver.de
