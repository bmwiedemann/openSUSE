  <title>A network traffic monitor for Linux</title>
  <description>This package is based on the package 'vnstat' from project 'openSUSE:lists'.

vnStat is a network traffic monitor for Linux that keeps a log of daily
network traffic for the selected interface(s). vnStat isn't a packet
sniffer. The traffic information is analyzed from the /proc
-filesystem, so vnStat can be used without root permissions.
