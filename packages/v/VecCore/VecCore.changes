- Update to version 0.8.0:
  * New backend based on GCC 11's implementation of
    std::experimental::simd, which is part of the experimental
    support for data parallel types in C++20.
  * This backend offers the best of both Vc and UME::SIMD,
    as it performs well in most cases, from SSE2 up to AVX512.
