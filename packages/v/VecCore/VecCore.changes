Sat Jul 12 20:08:36 UTC 2025 - Christoph G <foss@grueninger.de>

- Do not force C++14, most recent gtest needs C++17 as does VecCore
  0.8.2 by default

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Dec 28 14:44:08 UTC 2024 - Andrea Manzini <andrea.manzini@suse.com>

- update to 0.8.2:
  * Adapt to CMake policy CMP0146, FindCUDA.cmake removed (#25)
  * Disable std::simd backend when compiling with libc++ since their implementation is incomplete (#27)
  * Switch to C++17 as baseline C++ standard
  * Require CMake 3.16 or later, mark up to 3.30 as supported
  * Add support for Nvidia HPC Toolkit Compiler, GCC 15, and Clang 19
  * Drop math functions benchark compiled with -ffast-math
  * Fix memory leak in Julia set benchmark
  * Update builtin version of Vc to 1.4.5
  * Update bundled version of GoogleTest to 1.15.2 and Google benchmark to 1.9.0
  * Update scripts to build/test VecCore with CTest
  * Fix various compiler warnings from newer compiler versions

Thu Apr 25 08:48:55 UTC 2024 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Pass CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=14 to cmake to allow building tests
  against gtest >= 1.14.0.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun 27 15:49:12 UTC 2023 - Dirk MÃ¼ller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 0.8.1:
  * Mark all `Mask{Empty,Full}` as `VECCORE_ATT_HOST_DEVICE`
  * Avoid including SIMD headers when compiling with nvcc

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr 22 00:34:16 UTC 2022 - Ferdinand Thiessen <rpm@fthiessen.de>

- Update to version 0.8.0:
  * New backend based on GCC 11's implementation of
    std::experimental::simd, which is part of the experimental
    support for data parallel types in C++20.
  * This backend offers the best of both Vc and UME::SIMD,
    as it performs well in most cases, from SSE2 up to AVX512.
- Drop upstream fixed VecCore-support-external-ctest.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb 22 22:15:25 UTC 2021 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Initial package.
- Add VecCore-support-external-ctest.patch: Support using external
  gtest instead of building it in-source; patch sent upstream.
