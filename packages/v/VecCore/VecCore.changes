  * Require CMake 3.16 or later, mark up to 3.30 as supported
  * Add support for Nvidia HPC Toolkit Compiler, GCC 15, and Clang 19
  * Drop math functions benchark compiled with -ffast-math
  * Fix memory leak in Julia set benchmark
  * Update builtin version of Vc to 1.4.5
  * Update bundled version of GoogleTest to 1.15.2 and Google benchmark to 1.9.0
  * Update scripts to build/test VecCore with CTest
  * Fix various compiler warnings from newer compiler versions

Fri Apr 22 00:34:16 UTC 2022 - Ferdinand Thiessen <rpm@fthiessen.de>

- Update to version 0.8.0:
  * New backend based on GCC 11's implementation of
    std::experimental::simd, which is part of the experimental
    support for data parallel types in C++20.
  * This backend offers the best of both Vc and UME::SIMD,
    as it performs well in most cases, from SSE2 up to AVX512.
- Drop upstream fixed VecCore-support-external-ctest.patch

Mon Feb 22 22:15:25 UTC 2021 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Initial package.
- Add VecCore-support-external-ctest.patch: Support using external
  gtest instead of building it in-source; patch sent upstream.
