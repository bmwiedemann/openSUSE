  <title>C++ Library for Portable SIMD Vectorization</title>
  <description>VecCore is a simple abstraction layer on top of other vectorization libraries.
It provides an architecture-independent API for expressing vector operations on
data. Code written with this API can then be dispatched to one of several
backends like Vc, UME::SIMD, or a scalar implementation.
