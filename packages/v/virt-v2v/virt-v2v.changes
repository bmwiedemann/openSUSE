- Update to version 2.0.5
  * Virt-v2v has been modularised allowing external programs to
    examine the state of the conversion and inject their own
    copying step. Further enhancements will be made to this new
    architecture in forthcoming releases.
  * The command line is almost identical apart from some debugging
    features that were removed (see below). The only significant
    difference is that the output format (-of) now has to be
    specified if it is different from the input format, whereas
    previous versions of virt-v2v would use the same output format
    as input format automatically.
  * A lot of time was spent improving the performance of virt-v2v
    in common cases.
  * Implement conversion of ALT Linux guests (Mikhail Gordeev).
  * Many bug fixes and performance enhancements were made to oVirt
    imageio output (Nir Soffer).
  * There is a new virt-v2v-in-place(1) tool which replaces the
    existing virt-v2v --in-place option.
  * Virt-v2v can now convert guests which use LUKS encrypted
    logical volumes (Laszlo Ersek).
  * Option -oo rhv-direct has been replaced by -oo rhv-proxy, and
    direct mode (which is much faster) is now the default when
    writing to oVirt, with proxy mode available for restricted
    network configurations (thanks: Nir Soffer).
  * The following command line options were removed:
    --print-estimate, --debug-overlays, --no-copy.
  * Virt-v2v no longer installs the RHEV-APT tool in Windows
    guests. This tool was deprecated and then removed in oVirt 4.3.
  * Deprecated tool virt-v2v-copy-to-local has been removed.
    This was deprecated in November 2018.
