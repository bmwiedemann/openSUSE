  <title>Virtualize the running distro or a simple rootfs</title>
  <description>Virtme is a set of simple tools to run a virtualized Linux kernel that
uses the host Linux distribution or a simple rootfs instead of a whole
disk image.

Virtme is tiny, easy to use, and makes testing kernel changes quite simple.

Some day this might be useful as a sort of sandbox.  Right now it's not
really configurable enough for that.
