    <comment>- Install appdata xml file only in /usr/share/metainfo
- Update to version 5.5.0
  * The most requested feature is finally added; media stream
    configuration! A new media stream button has been added and
    enabled for use when clips are all derived from the same source
    media OR media files added manually all share the same codecs,
    formats, etc... A view of all detected streams including video,
    audio, text/subtitles. Chapters are not included as they are
    treated differently by FFmpeg and followng the usual rule of
    thumb in VidCutter which is they will be included in your end
    result if the original source is not corrupt or in some weird
    non-standard configuration.
  * Migrated main toolbar buttons from QToolBar + QActions to new
    custom widget VCToolBarButton handling QPushButton with
    attached. This allows working pressed states on existing
    toolbar buttons which QToolBar buttons (for reasons I cannot
    fathom) do not.
  * Tools section added to settings for setting paths to three
    main tools used by VidCutter; FFmpeg, FFprobe and MediaInfo.
    Set to Defaults button reverts changes to defaults, especially
    useful for users of bundled packages of app (AppImage, Windows
    and macOS which contain these tools prepacked). Allows you to
    use different versions of said tools.
  * End of file is now being observed in the mpv library event
    pool so that playback state resets position back to the start,
    in pause and all controls in their default states.
  * Ability to set clip index list to the left or right (default)
    of main window.
  * Support for WTV (.wtv - Windows Recorded TV Show) media files
    (playback and cutting/joining) added.
  * Required dependency of PyOpenGL python module introduced for
    users on slightly older Ubuntu, Fedora and Ubuntu based Linux
    distributions. such as Mint or ElementaryOS. This now fixes
    things if you were experiencing immediate segmentation faults
    when launching. no OpenGL context could be created. Again,
    this only applies to Linux and only to those distro mentioned
    above. No user manual tasks needed, Ubuntu and Fedora packaging
    scripts already updated so it should all be seamless to the end
    user.
  * ffprobe code fixed for media that is either problematic or
    imperfect. stdout and stderr streams separated for ffprobe
    calls, thus fixing ffprobe JSON parsing errors and allowing the
    addition of the new .WTV media file format.
  * Minor changes/improvements to a few other front panel buttons
    w/ pressed states where previously unavailable + minor cosmetic
    improvements to color schemes of hover/active state buttons
  * Linux desktop and appdata metadata files switched to reverse
    domain notation file names as per freedesktop.org specs
  * Fullscreen mode rewrite for Qt 5.10 changes + better support
    in wayland.
  * OpenGL helpers added to X11 and Wayland based Linux platforms
    to better assist with fullscreen functionality and video render
    compatibility any where an OpenGL context can be created.
  * Updated keyboard shortcuts information to include some added
    keyboard and mouse based shortcuts.
  * Defined cutting regions shown on the timeline are now hidden
    during the &quot;generating thumbnails&quot; process (mainly evident when
    turning thumbnails on/off or resizing the application's window)
  * Better detection and prompting if application exit is
    attempted while video processing jobs in progress, if user
    decides to continue quitting then kill all VidCutter associated
    jobs gracefully and force the usual cleanup routines
