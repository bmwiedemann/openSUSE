  <title>VirtX</title>
  <description>A simple federation of KVM hosts based on libvirt and serf, working with centralized shared storage.
It offers a REST API to interact with the cluster, so as to make it easier to implement custom KVM platforms.

This package is still experimental and under development, so use at your own risk for experimentation only,
not for production.</description>
