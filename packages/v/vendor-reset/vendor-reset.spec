%description
A kernel module that is capable of resetting hardware devices into a state
where they can be re-initialized or passed through into a virtual machine
(VFIO). While it would be great to have these in the kernel as PCI quirks,
some of the reset procedures are very complex and would never be accepted
as a quirk (ie AMD Vega 10).
