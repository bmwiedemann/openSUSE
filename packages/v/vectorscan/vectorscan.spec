%description
A fork of Intel's Hyperscan, modified to run on more platforms.

Vectorscan will follow Intel's API and internal algorithms where possible,
but will not hesitate to make code changes where it is thought of giving
better performance or better portability. In addition, the code will be
gradually simplified and made more uniform and all architecture specific
-currently Intel- #ifdefs will be removed and abstracted away.
