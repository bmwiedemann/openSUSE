    Following files are affected bookmark, closed, command, config,
    cookies.db, history, queue and search.
    Existing files could be moved to the new location by

    mv $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/vimb/{bookmark,closed,command,cookies.db,history,queue,search} \
        $XDG_DATA_HOME/vimb

    # and same for existing profiles
    mkdir $XDG_DATA_HOME/vimb/<ProfileName>

  * Prevent possible use after free in autocmd processing.
  Removed:
  * Expansion of % to the current opened URI for :shellcmd was removed
    because it breaks the x-hint-command with URIs containing '%'. But it is
    still possible to use $VIMB_URI for the :shellcmd which has the same
    effect.
