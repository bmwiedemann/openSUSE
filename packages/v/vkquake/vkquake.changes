- Update to version 1.11.0
  * Initial support for Quake 2021 re-release
  * External vis file support
- Update to version 1.10.0
  * Merged protocol extensions from QuakeSpasm-Spiked. This fixes
    non smooth movement on elevators in certain cases.
  * Custom HUD client side QuakeC support for Arcane Dimensions
    (disable with cl_nocsqc 1).
  * SIMD CPU optimizations from Andrei Drexler - especially helpful
    in complex levels like ad_tears.
  * Stencil buffer optimizations for sky rendering reducing
    overdraw.
  * Resolution scaling to 1/2 1/4 or 1/8th resolution.
  * Added support for r_fullbright & r_lightmap.
  * Implemented full r_showtris support.
  * Option in menu to set max frame rate.
  * Higher precision game time and precise frame rate throttling.
  * Fix exclusive full screen alt+tab issues.
  * Bumped default heap size to 384MB.
  Changes from beta1:
  * Fixed potential issue with Intel GPUs and render scale.
  * Renamed "filter" to "textures" in menu to make it more clear
    what the option does.
  * Fixed missing gun icons in HUD.
  Changes from beta2:
  * Fixes ambient sounds.
  * Multiple memory corruption fixes.
  * Fix compatibility with some mods.
- Update to version 1.05.3
  * Fixed dynamic lights not updating properly.
  * Added menu options for particles (GL or software style).
  * Added "exclusive" menu option to fullscreen setting to control
    VK_EXT_full_screen_exclusive.
  * Removed a bunch of rendering cvars that do nothing in vkQuake.
  * Fixed edge case with out of range fog values.
- Strip binary

- Update to version 1.05.2
  * Only use VK_EXT_full_screen_exclusive with NVIDIA drivers as
    people reported problems with other configurations
  * Fall back to non exclusive full screen if swap chain can't be created
  * Fix descriptor set leak
  * Fix rare crash in vertex buffer memory management
  * Fix world dynamic light update lagging one frame behind brushes

- Update to 1.04.1. Changes since 1.02.0:
  * Lots of Vulkan fixes
  * Frame rates over 72 Hz don't break physics anymore
  * Default maximum frame rate raised to 200 Hz.
  * Fix crashes with some Intel drivers and anti aliasing
  * Fix crash "out of dynamic vertex buffer space"
    in some very large custom maps
  * Fix gun position being different than in QuakeSpasm
    when status bar alpha is 0
  * Fixed alpha tested alias models
  * Fixed too large dynamic buffer allocations
  * Lightmaps are now dynamically allocated (from QuakeSpasm)
  * Particles are now rendered as quads instead of triangles
    by default (r_quadparticles) like in QuakeSpasm.
  * Fix alpha tested geo not testing depth
  * Fix issue where wrong push constants were being
    set if render size is smaller than window
  * Fixed certain UI elementes being rendered with alpha
    blending instead of alpha testing like in QS
