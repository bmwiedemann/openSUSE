Thu May  1 16:46:58 UTC 2025 - Michael Pujos <pujos.michael@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.32.2
  * Fixes:
    - #767 : Deactivate transparent surface optimization (r_drawwater_fast 0)
      in order to fix non-water (lava, slime...etc.) transparency issues
      on particular levels. This has no apparent performance impact so
      r_drawwater_fast 0 is the default until a better solution arises
    - #785: Dot crosshair enables player footstep sounds in Scourge of Armagon
    - #787 : Added sv_fte_recursivehullckeck (default 1) to allow deactivation
      of FTE physics optimizations, for some levels with bad item placement
      (stuck in walls, falling through surfaces...etc)
  * Improvements:
    - #777 : MDL external skins support. (from QSS)
    - This change brings vkQuake roughly at the level of QSS w.r.t external
      textures support for BSP levels, BSP models, MDL & MD5 models
    Other minor external textures support adjustments
    - #784 : added DP_SV_NODRAWTOCLIENT and DP_SV_DRAWONLYTOCLIENT extensions. (from QSS)
    - Added more Crosshair choices
    - Added labels to Sliders (from QS). Added a Max FPS slider in particular
      with a more natural scale
    - Code cleanups
    - Library updates

Wed Mar  5 19:26:15 UTC 2025 - Michael Pujos <pujos.michael@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.32.1
  * Fixes:
    - #772: Performance regression when host_maxfps > 72 visible on
      especially large levels (you know what they are)
    - #764: Align modern hud closer to the remaster and render keys for
      hipnotic as well
    - #779: Erroneous assertion triggered
  * Improvements:
    - Boost fps on especially large levels by enabling sv_fastpushmove 1
      by default. Can be disabled (0) at any time if something goes wrong
    - #765: Standalone MD5 support. Mods can now use MD5 in QuakeC explicitly
      as *.md5mesh the same way *.mdl was used before. The 2 types of models
      can be mixed in the same progs.dat of course
    - Code cleanups
    - Library updates

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jan 12 10:08:24 UTC 2025 - Michael Pujos <pujos.michael@gmail.com>
