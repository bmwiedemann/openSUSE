Fri Mar 27 23:05:55 UTC 2020 - Christophe Giboudeaux <christophe@krop.fr>

- Update to 1.04.1. Changes since 1.02.0:
  * Lots of Vulkan fixes
  * Frame rates over 72 Hz don't break physics anymore
  * Default maximum frame rate raised to 200 Hz.
  * Fix crashes with some Intel drivers and anti aliasing
  * Fix crash "out of dynamic vertex buffer space"
    in some very large custom maps
  * Fix gun position being different than in QuakeSpasm
    when status bar alpha is 0
  * Fixed alpha tested alias models
  * Fixed too large dynamic buffer allocations
  * Lightmaps are now dynamically allocated (from QuakeSpasm)
  * Particles are now rendered as quads instead of triangles
    by default (r_quadparticles) like in QuakeSpasm.
  * Fix alpha tested geo not testing depth
  * Fix issue where wrong push constants were being
    set if render size is smaller than window
  * Fixed certain UI elementes being rendered with alpha
    blending instead of alpha testing like in QS
  * Fix issue with Intel GPUs crashing when leaving full screen
  * Updated to latest QuakeSpasm code
  * Fix particle alpha being affected by fog
