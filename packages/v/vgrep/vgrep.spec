%description
vgrep is a command-line tool to search textual patterns in directories. It
serves as a frontend to grep and git-grep and allows to open the indexed
matching lines in a user-specified editor. vgrep is inspired by the ancient
cgvg scripts but extended to perform further operations such as listing
statistics of files and directory trees or showing the context lines before and
after the matches.
