- Add package for vgrep v2.0.1 (https://github.com/vrothberg/vgrep)

  vgrep is a command-line tool to search textual patterns in directories. It
  serves as a frontend to grep and git-grep and allows to open the indexed
  matching lines in a user-specified editor. vgrep is inspired by the ancient
  cgvg scripts but extended to perform further operations such as listing
  statistics of files and directory trees or showing the context lines before
  and after the matches.
