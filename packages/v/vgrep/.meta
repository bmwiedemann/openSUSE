  <description>vgrep is a command-line tool to search textual patterns in directories. It serves as a frontend to grep and git-grep and allows to open the indexed matching lines in a user-specified editor. vgrep is inspired by the ancient cgvg scripts but extended to perform further operations such as listing statistics of files and directory trees or showing the context lines before and after the matches.</description>
