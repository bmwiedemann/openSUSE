  <title>Browse a Subversion Repository with a Web Browser</title>
  <description>ViewVC is a browser interface for CVS and Subversion version control
repositories. It generates templatized HTML to present navigable
directory, revision, and change log listings. It can display specific
versions of files as well as diffs between those versions. Basically,
ViewVC provides the bulk of the report-like functionality you expect
out of your version control tool, but much prettier than the average
textual command-line program output.

ViewVC is the successor of ViewCVS.</description>
