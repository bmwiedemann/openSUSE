Subject: [PATCH] Power PC Fix extraction of the L field for sync instruction

The L field is currently a two bit[22:21] field in ISA 3.0. The size of the
L field has changed over time.

Currently the ISA 3.0 Valgrind sync instruction support code sets the
flag_L for the instruction L field to a five bit value that includes bits
that are marked reserved the sync instruction.  This patch fixes the issue for ISA 3.0
to only setting flag_L the specified two bits.
