  version of the extpack that is installed. If no pack is installed
  or if the license is not current, the new code does nothing. If there
  is a current license and the installed pack does not match the
  running version of VB, then the script downloads and installs the
  new version. File "update-extpack.sh" is added.

Tue Dec 24 21:59:07 UTC 2019 - Larry Finger <Larry.Finger@gmail.com>

- Version update to 6.1.0 (released December 10 2019 by Oracle)
  - Fixes bsc#1132102.
  - Removed file "set_graphics_type.patch" as the problem is fixed upstream.

  This is a major update. The following major new features were added:

  - Implemented support for importing a virtual machine from Oracle Cloud Infrastructure
  - Extended support for exporting a virtual machine to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, allowing the creation
	of multiple virtual machines without re-uploading. Also added option to export a VM to the cloud using the more efficient
	variant "paravirtialized", and to specify free-form tags for cloud images
  - Virtualization core: Support for nested hardware-virtualization on Intel CPUs (starting with 5th generation Core i,
	codename Broadwell), so far tested only with guest running VirtualBox
  - Graphics: New style 3D support (with VBoxSVGA and VMSVGA) remains, old style 3D support (with VBoxVGA) has been completely removed
  - Shared Clipboard: Implemented experimental support for file transfers (Windows hosts/guests only at the moment).
	Needs to be enabled via VBoxManage (disabled by default). In addition, the following items were fixed and/or added:

  In addition, the following items were fixed and/or added:

  - Virtualization core: Drop recompiler, i.e. running VMs now needs a CPU supporting hardware virtualization
  - Runtime: Works now on hosts with many CPUs (limit now 1024)
  - Appliance and Cloud Import: Add field for defining firmware type (not part of OVF spec and thus manual in the Appliance case,
	for OCI it is automatically taken from the instance information)
  - GUI: Improved the VISO creation and file manager dialogs
  - GUI: Virtual machine list of VirtualBox Manager was improved. Machine groups are now more obvious visually and VM
	search functionality has been improved. Global Tools element can now be pinned in place, to avoid scrolling it with rest of machine list
  - GUI: Virtual machine details pane is now extended with embedded editors for selected VM attributes, allowing user to edit them
	on-the-fly byi clicking corresponding hyper-links without opening VM settings dialog
  - GUI: Details pane provides more complete information
  - GUI: Internal medium enumeration routines were optimized to reduce the load and optimize the performance in cases when
	user have lots of media registered. Also, we again allowed to add existing media (and create new) via Virtual Media Manager
  - GUI: More consistent medium selection (both showing known images and allowing to select using the file picker)
  - GUI: VM storage settings page was adjusted a bit in usability regard. User is now allowed to change controller bus type
	and can move attachments between the controllers by using drag and drop
  - GUI: Storage and Network settings pages bug-fixes and usability optimization
  - GUI: Added a new soft (virtual) keyboard enabling arbitrary keyboard input to guests, including multimedia keys
  - GUI: Fixed crash in cloud related wizards when accessibility functionality was enabled
  - GUI: Show VM CPU load as part of status bar CPU indicator
  - GUI: Improved and extended the Session Information dialog
  - GUI: Fixed/improved mouse pointer scaling

	Note that this support is automatically used by Linux guests but not by Windows guests
  - vboximg-mount: Experimental support for direct read-only access to NTFS, FAT and ext2/3/4 filesystems inside a disk
	image without the need for support on the host
  - vboximg-mount: Now also available on Linux host
  - Storage: Experimental support for virtio-scsi, for both hard disks and optical drives (including boot support in BIOS)
  - Storage: For optical drive emulation fix empty host drive crash

  - ACPI: Report NVMe controller
  - VGA: Improve hardware and BIOS compatibility
  - VBoxSVGA/VMSVGA: Support YUV2 and related texture formats with hosts using OpenGL (macOS and Linux),
	 which accelerates video playback when 3D is enabled by delegating the color space conversion to the host GPU
  - VBoxSVGA/VMSVGA: Several drawing fixes for the 3D case
  - VMSVGA 3D: Fixed OpenGL compressed textures
  - VBoxManage: More cloud functionality coverage, e.g. starting a cloud instance
  - VBoxManage: As part of the guest control feature support moving multiple source files/directories to a target directory
  - Guest Control/VBoxManage: Added support for specifying multiple sources when renaming guest files
  - VBoxManage: Show "unrestricted guest" and "nested HW virtualization" CPU features when listing the host information
  - API: Reduce the amount of leftovers from Move VM function
  - Shared Clipboard: Implemented experimental support for file transfers for Linux hosts on Windows guests (disabled by default)
  - SMBIOS: Store system UUID in little endian format which is the default for new VMs, while existing VMs stick to the old VirtualBox
	 behavior of storing them in big endian format for backwards compatibility to avoid breaking the activation status of Windows VMs
  - VBoxSDL frontend: Fixed running on Windows hosts
  - Linux host: Improve vboxweb systemd service dependency information
  - Linux host: Drop PCI passthrough, the current code is too incomplete (cannot handle PCIe devices at all), i.e. not useful enough
  - Linux host and guest: Support Linux 5.4 (bug #18945)
  - Linux host and guest: Force disabling of kernel module signing during build (user can do it afterwards)

- The VirtualBox packages for both Tumbleweed and Leap 15.1 are now derived from the sources in Factory;
  however, the underlying kernels are very different in that vboxvideo.ko is built-into the TW kernel,
  thus the package did not try to build that module. The result is that Leap 15.1 guests have only 640x480
  resolution (boo#1132439). These changes conditionally turn building of the kernel module back on. As TW
  does not need the module, it is only built for Leap 15.1.

Sun Apr 14 16:32:29 UTC 2019 - Larry Finger <Larry.Finger@gmail.com>

- An instance of /usr/lib/virtualbox/VirtualBoxVM being installed without SUID privilege
  has been reported as boo#1132379. Unfortunately, the error message thrown by VB in this

  been modified to check the permissions and pop up a warning describing the problem and
  showing the command needed to fix the problem. File "vbox-suid-warning.diff" is added.

- Make additional change specified in bsc#1060072. Moving VBoxSDL and VBoxSDL.so from package
  virtualbox to virtualbox-qt removes an additional need to load the libqt* binaries on a
  text-only installation running headless VMs.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 25 20:15:56 UTC 2017 - Larry.Finger@lwfinger.net

- Make changes suggested in bsc#1060072
  The specific changes are:
  (1) Remove the test in vboxdrv.sh as the script tests for the wrong file. This is safe because
      if the package is not installed, the script will not be there.
  (2) Move VBoxDbg.so to package virtualbox-qt. With this change, packages libQt5Core, libQt5Gui
      and libQt5Widgets are no longer needed with package virtualbox. As a result, a text-only
      server no longer needs to load QT to support headless virtual machines.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul 18 14:19:44 UTC 2017 - Larry.Finger@lwfinger.net

- In kernel 4.13, wait_queue_t => wait_queue_entry_t. File "vbox_fix_for_kernel_4.13.patch" patches the source to account for this change.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul 10 18:22:25 UTC 2017 - Larry.Finger@lwfinger.net

- Fix several problems with the startup scripts. The SysV form is no longer used for most packages as proper systemd
  service files have been created. These fixes address bsc#1037291, #1043532, and #1045871.
- Increase reserved disk space from 4 to 5 GB. This change was suddested as a fix for the 32-bit failures. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun 30 00:50:42 UTC 2017 - Larry.Finger@lwfinger.net

- Fix missing global for 32-bit version with gcc7. (bsc#1046571).

  Fix typo in above changes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jun 25 00:20:08 UTC 2017 - Larry.Finger@lwfinger.net

- Fix some typos in the various service files as noted in boo#1044931.
  With these fixes, TW guests start correctly. In addition, the /sbin/vboxconfig (for hosts) and the
  /sbin/vboxguestconfig (for guests) work correctly.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun 21 16:46:48 UTC 2017 - Larry.Finger@lwfinger.net

- Now that kernel:HEAD:standard has changed to version 4.12.0-rcX, the VB drivers need some changes for new API's.
  File "vbox_fix_for_kernel_4.12.patch" is added.
  The added installation of "net-tools-deprecated" broke builds for Leap 42.3. That change is now conditional on building for Factory.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jun 10 13:19:05 UTC 2017 - Larry.Finger@lwfinger.net

- Add installation of package "net-tools-deprecated" as requested in boo#1027742.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun  8 17:37:35 UTC 2017 - Larry.Finger@lwfinger.net

- Revise warning screen concerning USB passthru - fixes bnc#1041137.
  USB passthru opens a security hole, yet it is so valuable that many users want the feature, thus it is our default.
  Previously, a user needed to edit a udev rule to disable passthru. The bad part was that an update of VB changed the
  rule back to allow passthru without any notification. These changes modify the popup to allow the user to accept or decline
  passthru. If the user declines, then the root password is requested and the udev rule is modified. As these modifications will be
  lost with the next VB update, the inode of the udev rule is kept. If the user has previously declined and the inode has changed,
  the popup will show the next time VB is started. File "fix_usb_rules.sh" is added.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun May 21 13:28:15 UTC 2017 - hpj@urpla.net

- add %dir /usr/share/licenses to new vnc package

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 17 20:33:08 UTC 2017 - Larry.Finger@lwfinger.net

- Made changes to build with gcc 7.x. This adds new file "vbox_fix_for_gcc7.patch".
  Changed the building of VBoxVNC to remove the hack used earlier.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 10 17:39:57 UTC 2017 - Larry.Finger@lwfinger.net

- Make a number of changes:
  * Add VBoxVNC as a proper external pack rather than just make the so available (bnc #1037033). Thanks to Michal Nowak for most of this effort.
    One hack was required to work around a bug in "VBoxManage extpack install" whereby the --accept-license option failed to work.
  * Improve startup of VirtualBox through use of systemd service files:
    a. Beginning with Oracle version 5.0.8, the command used to build the kernel modules outside of the RPM packaging
       code changed; however, the openSUSE version did not implement the new method. That new code is now implemented.
    b. In Tumbleweed, the SysV init scripts to systemd service files stopped working. Part of the new code also checks
       to see if the kernel modules are loaded. If not, new script files are called to include the necessary packages
       and build the necessary modules.
    c. The hooks are in place to remove the sysv init files and do the complete conversion to systemd. This step will
       be done at a later time.

  * New files are "vboxconfig.sh", "vboxguestconfig.sh", "vboxdrv.service", and "vboxadd-service.service".
  * New sub-packages virtualbox-guest-source and virtualbox-vnc are produced.
  * Some typos in virtualbox.spec are fixed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May  4 17:59:45 UTC 2017 - Larry.Finger@lwfinger.net

- Add libelf-devel to build. Fixes bnc #1037511.
  Modified the startup files to build the kernel modules if they are missing. Files "vboxconfig.sh" and "vboxguestconfig" added.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Apr 29 17:24:10 UTC 2017 - Larry.Finger@lwfinger.net

- Version bump to 5.1.22 (released 2017-04-28 by Oracle)

This is a maintenance release. The following items were fixed and/or added:

VMM: fixed VERR_IEM_INSTR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED Guru Meditation under certain conditions (5.1 regression; mostly Mac OS X hosts; bugs #15693, #15801, #16274, #16569, #16663)
VMM: fixed software virtualization on Solaris hosts (5.1.20 regression)
Storage: fixed a potential hang under rare circumstances (bug #16677)

Linux hosts: make the ALSA backend work again as well as loading the GL libraries on certain hosts (5.1.20 regression; bugs #16667, #16693)
Linux Additions: fixed mount.vboxsf symlink problem (5.1.20 regression; bug #16670)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Apr 29 04:38:33 UTC 2017 - Larry.Finger@lwfinger.net

- VirtualBox has always been started by systemd utilizing the old-style scripts in /etc/init.d.
  These should be converted to the service files native to systemd. This issue has been forced
  as a recent update to Tumbleweed broke the startup of VB for both TW hosts and guests. This
  change starts the conversion to native systemd files. The original scripts are still used; however,
  service files are used to start and stop the VB components. In a later change, all action will
  be accomplished using systemd service files.

  Two new files named "vboxdrv.service" and "vboxadd-service.service" are added.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 20 19:51:27 UTC 2017 - Larry.Finger@lwfinger.net

-  Fixes for CVE-2017-3561, CVE-2017-3563, CVE-2017-3576, CVE-2017-3558, CVE-2017-3587

    Linux hosts: fixed autostart service script (bug #14955)
    Windows Additions: fixed automatic logins for Windows Vista and newer (5.1.4 regression; bug #15904) 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar  9 18:54:31 UTC 2017 - Larry.Finger@lwfinger.net

- Removed "vbox_fix_4.10_api_changes.patch" - fixed upstream
  Removed "vbox_fix_4.11_api_changes.patch" - fixed upstream

- Version bump to 5.1.16 (released 2017-03-08 by Oracle)

  Make some changes to various script files to remove reference to run level 4, which is not used.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Mar  4 05:00:03 UTC 2017 - Larry.Finger@lwfinger.net

- Fix for missing global in vboxsf that prevented mounting shared folders
  for kernel 4.10.  This change is the fix for bsc #1027967.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb 28 21:06:30 UTC 2017 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Do not proivde libGL.so.1 and libEGL.so.1 symbols into the rpm
  database.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Feb 26 20:17:02 UTC 2017 - Larry.Finger@lwfinger.net

- The fix for 3D acceleration only works for Gmome desktops. KDE desktops fail. Accordingly,
  3D acceleration must still be disabled "out-of-the-box". File /etc/init.d/vboxadd contains
  comments on the modifications needed to turn 3D acceleration on, thus Gnome users may turn
  it on selectively.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb 24 03:34:35 UTC 2017 - Larry.Finger@lwfinger.net

- Fix 3D acceleration as reported in bsc #1024934. The steps needed are as follows:
 -  Remove file "vbox_prevent_wrong_SONAME.patch" - the original SONAME values are needed for
    libGL.so.1 and libEGL.so.1 to be replaced by VBoxOGL.so and VBoxEGL.so, respectively.
 -  Package VBoxEGL.so 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb 23 12:37:09 CET 2017 - kukuk@suse.de

- Require insserv and fillup by the packages who call it in the
  pre/post install sections

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb  2 15:30:05 UTC 2017 - adam.majer@suse.de

- use individual libboost-*-devel packages instead of boost-devel

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jan 28 20:37:54 UTC 2017 - Larry.Finger@lwfinger.net

- Removed "vbox_fix_4.9_api_changes.patch" as changes are upstream.
  Fixed API changes for kernel 4.10 in "vbox_fix_4.10_api_changes.patch".

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan 25 02:52:51 UTC 2017 - Larry.Finger@lwfinger.net

- The version bump to 5.1.14 also addresses boo#1020856 CVE-2017-3316 CVE-2017-3332 CVE-2017-3290 CVE-2016-5545

- Version bump to 5.1.14 (released 2017-01-17 by Oracle)

This is a maintenance release. The following items were fixed and/or added:

    VMM: fixed emulation of certain instructions for 64-bit guests on 32-bit hosts
    VMM: properly handle certain MSRs for 64-bit guests on ancient CPUs without VT-x support for MSR bitmaps (bug #13886)
    GUI: fixed a crash with multimonitor setups under certain conditions
    GUI: allow cloning of snapshots when the VM is running
    NVMe: fixed compatibility with the Storage Performance Development Kit (SPDK, bug #16368)
    VBoxSVC: fixed a crash under rare circumstances
    VBoxManage: added a sanity check to modifymedium --resize to prevent users from resizing their hard disk from 1GB to 1PB (bug #16311)
    Windows hosts: another fix for recent Windows 10 hosts
    Linux hosts: Linux 4.10 fixes
    Linux Additions: fixed protocol error during certain operations on shared folders (bug #8463)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jan 14 02:14:27 UTC 2017 - Larry.Finger@lwfinger.net

- The printing of the warning about the insecurity in USB passthru had been lost. As most people are likely to want that feature,
  the logic has been inverted. Now, the required udev commands to allow passthru are included. The first time that VB is started,
  the user will get a screen that points to the bug entry discussing the problem and states what they should do to block the
  insecure usage. In any case, that screen will only be printed once. File "virtualbox-60-vboxdrv.rules" has been added
  These changes address the issues in bnc #1018340.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec 21 03:19:26 UTC 2016 - Larry.Finger@lwfinger.net

- Version bump to 5.1.12 (released 2016-12-20 by Oracle)

    VMM: fixed VERR_VMX_UNABLE_TO_START_VM Guru Meditations under rare conditions
    GUI: prevent a crash under certain conditions if the VM is terminated very early
    GUI: fixed certain keyboard capture issues (5.1.10 regression; Mac OS X hosts only; bug #16150)
    GUI: fixed dragging guest windows in seamless mode with the keyboard captured (X11 hosts only; bug #15837)
    GUI: fixed a problem where the new version detected dialog was covered by the appliance import dialog (Mac OS X hosts only; bug #16238)

    Storage: fixed creating a snapshot when the VM is running and an NVMe controller is present
    Storage: fixed a problem with the LsiLogic SCSI controller where requests could be lost with SMP guests
    E1000: fixed "cable disconnected" issue (Mac OS X guests only; 5.1.10 regression; bug #16260)
    E1000: fixed "TX unit hang" issue (Linux guests only; 5.1.10 regression; bug #16221)
    API: don't crash when sanitizing certain VM names (bug #16299)
    Linux hosts: automatically disable asynchronous I/O on Linux 2.6.18 kernels as high I/O load may trigger kernel oopses on these kernels if this feature is enabled
    Linux hosts / guests: Linux 2.6.28 compile fix (bug #16267)
    Linux hosts: compile Linux 4.9 compile fix (bug #16286)
    Linux Additions: warn the user about a known bug with older Linux guests (e.g. Debian 7) requiring manual work to get 3D working (bug #15319)
    Linux Additions: fix the graphics driver build with Linux 4.10 and later (bug #16298)
    Windows Additions: fixed a crash in the WDDM driver under certain conditions 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec 12 16:27:28 UTC 2016 - Larry.Finger@lwfinger.net

- Revert "vbox_hdpi_support.patch. This patch may improve things for asn@cryptomilk.org, but it breaks other systems.
  See https://forums.opensuse.org/showthread.php/521520-VirtualBox-interface-scaling and bsc #1014694.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec  5 22:34:34 UTC 2016 - Larry.Finger@lwfinger.net

- I now have the necessary preprocessor symbol to modify the source depending on whether the server is 1.19.0 or greater.
  It is no longer necessary to detect the server version in the spec file, thus the solution is cleaner.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec  5 17:03:34 UTC 2016 - Larry.Finger@lwfinger.net

- Leap 42.2 still has server v. 1.18.3, thus the test failed. The test has been changed to look at only the 1.xx part of the version.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Dec  4 16:59:29 UTC 2016 - Larry.Finger@lwfinger.net

- Add patch file "Fix_for_server_1.19.patch" to support xorg-x11-server v. 1.19.0.
  The spec file now interrogates the rpm for the server and conditionally applies the patch, thus both versions build OK.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov 30 16:45:43 UTC 2016 - asn@cryptomilk.org

- Add patch file "vbox_hidpi_support.patch" to add support for HiDPI in the
  management frontend.
  (This does not fix rendering in guest windows)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov 21 22:43:33 UTC 2016 - Larry.Finger@lwfinger.net

- Requesting 14000 MB is too much. Reduce the request to 12000 MB.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct 13 19:15:03 UTC 2016 - Larry.Finger@lwfinger.net

Fri Apr 15 19:17:58 UTC 2016 - Larry.Finger@lwfinger.net

-  Fix build error caused by removal of macro page_cache_release() from kernel.
   File "vbox-replace-page-cache-release.diff" is used to modify code to use put_page() instead.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr  4 00:01:12 UTC 2016 - Larry.Finger@lwfinger.net

-  Fix problem with SONAME for VBoxOGL.so. With the Oracle code, it is libGL.so.1 rather than VBoxOGL.so.1.
   Thanks to Max Lin <mlin@suse.com> for notifying me about the problem.
   This fix adds file "vbox_prevent_wrong_SONAME.patch"

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar 31 16:49:11 UTC 2016 - Larry.Finger@lwfinger.net

-  Fix problems with previous submission

   Removed copy of user manual from download site as there is no special manual for 5.0.17.
   File VirtualBox-5.0.17-r106108-r106140.patch is added to update the Oracle source to the latest commit.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 30 21:06:08 UTC 2016 - Larry.Finger@lwfinger.net

-  Modify Guest Additions so that openSUSE build works with new Oracle code. The following changes have been made:

   Added Oracle patch to bring code to r106140 commit.
   Moved VB guest modules to /lib/modules/.../misc/. This layout matches that of the Oracle Guest Additions ISO.
   Added missing copy of Module.symvers from vboxguest build so that loads of vboxvideo can resolve all symbols.
   Remove patch added in previous cycle to build under kernel 4.5.0. The Oracle code now has this fix.

   With these changes, both Gnome and KDE desktops as VB virtual machines work with gdm and the versions of X.Org that do not run as root.
   The only known defect is that the mouse pointer is missing when 3D acceleration is turned on in the VB control panel.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar  7 22:20:56 UTC 2016 - Larry.Finger@lwfinger.net

    There are no other changes to VirtualBox.

    A patch "vbox-guest-add.diff" is needed to enable the Oracle code to build with kernel 4.5.

    USB: fixed a crash under certain conditions on hosts with Linux kernels older than version 3.3
    USB: better identification of certain USB devices
    NAT: support TCP in DNS proxy (bug #14736)
    NAT Network: fixed sporadic crashes on Windows hosts (bug #13899)
    API: when creating differencing images (e.g. as part of a snapshot or cloning a VM) use the same disk image variant as the parent image if possible, which means that e.g. a diff image for a VMDK image split into 2 GB files will also be split (bug #14764)
    API: event queue handling fixes preventing loss of certain events at runtime (e.g. new webcam attached), particularly important on Mac OS X hosts
    Webcam: passthrough fix for certain devices (Windows hosts only)
    VBoxManage: don't crash on snapshot restorecurrent / edit if the VM has no snapshots

- Fixed typo in QMessageBox text in new popup window.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov  6 06:57:16 UTC 2015 - Larry.Finger@lwfinger.net

- Add logic to virtualbox-wrapper.sh to test if /etc/udev/rules.d/60-vboxdrv.rules exists. If not, a screen stating
  that passthru of USB devices is a security hole, and it refers the user to bnc#664520 for an explanation.
  It also explains the process for enabling USB passthru if the user really wants it. When the user closes
  the popup window, a dummy version of /etc/udev/rules.d/60-vboxdrv.rules is created, which prevents this
  window from being displayed every time VirtualBox is started.

- Fixes boo#953018.
