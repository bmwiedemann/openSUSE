    <comment>- Update to 0.14:
  * Somewhat incompatible changes
    This release contains a number of changes which are technically non-backwards
    compatible. However, all of them should have very little negative impact (i.e.,
    hard to notice the change without reading the changelog).
    At the same time, a bug, fixing which is likely to have an impact on user
    configuration, has been identified but not yet fixed to give a chance to
    update all affected vifmrc files. If a bug is likely to be relied on by the
    configuration, a dialog with the explanation and instructions will appear.
  * Sorting and non-Latin characters
    Until this release Vifm has always used byte sorting (effectively, sorting
    of UTF-8 byte sequences). From now on a form of Unicode normalization is
    applied to strings when sorting views and completion results. The change
    can be expanded to other cases in future releases. The measured performance
    impact is negligible (several percent).
    Practically, this means that characters like a and ä are now grouped
    together regardless of the way in which diacritic is being encoded. Some
    characters can still appear in weird non-alphabetic positions because full
    Unicode normalization results in losing case sensitivity and is therefore
    not applied.
  * Addressing some longtime woes
    For one reason or another some inconvenient peculiarities have accumulated
    over the years. Time has come to replace workarounds with something better:
      + global variables (g:var) replace the use of environmental variables
        for internal purposes, thus avoiding polluting environment of child processes
      + use of :let to invoke a builtin function discarding its result is
        superseded by a proper :call command
      + use of execute 'normal! gl' to run selection now has :open command
        as a better alternative
      + size of selection can now be queried via selected() (previous releases</comment>
