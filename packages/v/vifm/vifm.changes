Mon Feb 10 07:25:15 UTC 2025 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 0.14:
  * Somewhat incompatible changes
    This release contains a number of changes which are technically non-backwards
    compatible. However, all of them should have very little negative impact (i.e.,
    hard to notice the change without reading the changelog).
    At the same time, a bug, fixing which is likely to have an impact on user
    configuration, has been identified but not yet fixed to give a chance to
    update all affected vifmrc files. If a bug is likely to be relied on by the
    configuration, a dialog with the explanation and instructions will appear.
  * Sorting and non-Latin characters
    Until this release Vifm has always used byte sorting (effectively, sorting
    of UTF-8 byte sequences). From now on a form of Unicode normalization is
    applied to strings when sorting views and completion results. The change
    can be expanded to other cases in future releases. The measured performance
    impact is negligible (several percent).
    Practically, this means that characters like a and Ã¤ are now grouped
    together regardless of the way in which diacritic is being encoded. Some
    characters can still appear in weird non-alphabetic positions because full
    Unicode normalization results in losing case sensitivity and is therefore
    not applied.
  * Addressing some longtime woes
    For one reason or another some inconvenient peculiarities have accumulated
    over the years. Time has come to replace workarounds with something better:
      + global variables (g:var) replace the use of environmental variables
        for internal purposes, thus avoiding polluting environment of child processes
      + use of :let to invoke a builtin function discarding its result is
        superseded by a proper :call command
      + use of execute 'normal! gl' to run selection now has :open command
        as a better alternative
      + size of selection can now be queried via selected() (previous releases
        required expand('%c') == expand('%f') or an equivalent trick)
      + %{expression} macro in 'statusline' can now have } embedded as \} (\\ still means two slashes)
      + dialogs now recognize Enter and Escape keys as "yes" and "no" replies
  * More useful menus
    :copen recalled last navigation menu for years, but that's not always
    enough. Now up to 25 such menus are stored after their use and can be
    navigated to via :chistory/:colder/:cnewer.
    In addition, :grep or :find can be rerun on the same set of commands right
    from the menu which previously required leaving the menu just to get back
    to it.
    History of command-line in menus is now also managed and stored, making
    staying in menu mode for longer a more pleasant experience.
  * UI improvements
    Navigation between views/tabs via new :wingo command with optional
    incremental completion thanks to new 'wildinc' option (applicable to any
    other command or all of them at once).
    Ability to highlight a view column (:highlight column:size ...), specify
    how highlighting applies ('hloptions'), set a separator between miller
    columns in set fillchars+=millersep:'|', shorten columns in the middle (^
    in 'viewcolumn').
    Also, displaying of CJK characters on Windows should have much fewer issues now.
  * Lua API
    Slowly adding new functionality. This batch comes with things like
    primitive file operations, ability to create custom views or menus and
    handling ranges of :commands.
  * Other
    Search matches can be traversed via Tab and Shift-Tab while in the prompt
    (applies to navigation mode as well).
    An invalid expression in :if or :elseif no longer just skips that command,
    now all commands up to and including matching :endif are skipped to avoid
    executing half-random sequences of commands due to a mistake, which also
    results in better error messages. Previously, :elseif was also evaluating
    its expression even some earlier branch was already taken.
    :rename now asks whether file move is intended instead of assuming a user
    mistake and refusing to proceed.
    Support MTP devices by bundled vifm-media script if simple-mtpfs is
    installed. Also improve what devices are offered for mounting (e.g., don't
    offer a whole drive if it contains partitions).
    v:version to branch depending on release.
  * Fixes
    Get preview graphics out of the way in more cases (like when opening
    menus). Terminals with more than 32768 color pairs should not cause visual
    defects or crashes anymore.
    Merging of directories was either not asking for confirmation or aborting
    after skipping a file. Paths with some unreadable characters were not
    processed due to a regression. Directories weren't counted in estimates of
    file operations.
    && operator was always evaluating both branches instead of properly
    short-circuiting. %a macro of 'statusline' was displaying wrong values on
    non-Linux Unix-like systems. :compare falsely claimed that files of
    identical size and with common prefix are identical.

Mon Nov 12 10:17:00 UTC 2018 - mvetter@suse.com

- Update to 0.10:
  * New version includes long awaited tabs and support for managing media.
    The first one comes in two flavours: tabs either include layout or don't.
    The latter relies on a helper script, whose job is to adapt existing
    tools to make them usable by vifm.
  Main changes:
  * Added tabs which either operate on the level of layout or level of individual panes
  * Added ability to synchronize contents of registers among multiple instances
  * Added menu for managing media (relies on helper that does the managing)
  * Improved cursor positioning and control over it
  * Ability to colorize statusline
