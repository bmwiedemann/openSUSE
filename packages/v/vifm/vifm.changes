Mon Nov 12 10:17:00 UTC 2018 - mvetter@suse.com

- Update to 0.10:
  * New version includes long awaited tabs and support for managing media.
    The first one comes in two flavours: tabs either include layout or don't.
    The latter relies on a helper script, whose job is to adapt existing
    tools to make them usable by vifm.
  Main changes:
  * Added tabs which either operate on the level of layout or level of individual panes
  * Added ability to synchronize contents of registers among multiple instances
  * Added menu for managing media (relies on helper that does the managing)
  * Improved cursor positioning and control over it
  * Ability to colorize statusline

  * More natural behaviour of movement keys in ls-like view.
  * New --remote-expr command-line option that can be used to query state of running instances.
  * Extended retry/ignore/abort query of 'syscalls' to all file operations.
