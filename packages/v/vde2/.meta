  <title>Virtual Distributed Ethernet</title>
  <description>VDE is a virtual network that can be spawned over a set of physical
computer over the Internet

VDE connects together:
  (1) real GNU-linux boxes (tuntap)
  (2) virtual machines: UML-User Mode Linux, qemu, bochs, MPS.

VDE can be used:
  (i) to create a general purpose tunnel (every protocol that runs
    on a Ethernet can be put into the tunnel)
  (ii) to connect a set of virtual machine to the Internet with no
    need of free access of tuntap
  (iii) to support mobility: a VDE can stay interconnected despite
    of the change of virtual cables, i.e. the change of IP addresses
    and interface in the real world</description>
