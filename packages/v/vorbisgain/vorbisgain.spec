Calculate the Replay Gain for Ogg Vorbis files

VorbisGain is a utility that uses a psychoacoustic method to correct
the volume of an Ogg Vorbis file to a predefined standardized
loudness.

It is meant as a replacement for the normalization that is commonly
used before encoding. Although normalization will ensure that each
song has the same peak volume, this unfortunately does not say
anything about the apparent loudness of the music, with the end result
being that many normalized files still don't sound equally
loud. VorbisGain uses psychoacoustics to address this
deficiency. Moreover, unlike normalization, it's a lossless procedure
which works by adding tags to the file. Additionally, it will add
hints that can be used to prevent clipping on playback. It is based
upon the ReplayGain technology.

The end result is that playback is both more convenient and of higher
quality compared to a non-VorbisGain'ed file.
