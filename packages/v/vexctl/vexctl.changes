  * Bump chainguard-dev/actions from 1.6.1 to 1.6.2 in the all group
- Security vulnerability advisements: Go code or dependencies cited
  in CVE reports are addressed or closed in this or previous
  releases. Eventually vexctl will be used to provide structured
  data documents with these use-specific advisements in a
  standardized computer readable format.
  * Fix bsc#1239186 CVE-2025-22868: vexctl: golang.org/x/oauth2/jws: Unexpected memory consumption during token parsing in golang.org/x/oauth2
    - govulncheck reports current version not affected by this CVE
    - golang.org/x/oauth2/jws is not used in current version
  * Fix bsc#1234486 CVE-2024-45337: vexctl: golang.org/x/crypto/ssh: Misuse of ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback may cause authorization bypass in golang.org/x/crypto

    - golang.org/x/crypto/ssh is not used in current version
  * Fix bsc#1237611 CVE-2025-27144: vexctl: github.com/go-jose/go-jose/v4,github.com/go-jose/go-jose/v3: Go JOSE's Parsing Vulnerable to Denial of Service

    - govulncheck reports current version not affected by this CVE
    - golang.org/x/crypto/ssh is not used in current version
  * Fix bsc#1240444 CVE-2025-30204: vexctl: github.com/golang-jwt/jwt/v4: jwt-go allows excessive memory allocation during header parsing
    - govulncheck reports current version not affected by this CVE
    - github.com/golang-jwt/jwt/v4    v4.5.2
  * Fix bsc#1253802 CVE-2025-58181: vexctl: golang.org/x/crypto/ssh: invalidated number of mechanisms can cause unbounded memory consumption
    - govulncheck reports current version not affected by this CVE

    - github.com/sigstore/fulcio      v1.8.5
  * Fix bsc#1257138 CVE-2026-24137: vexctl: github.com/sigstore/sigstore/pkg/tuf: legacy TUF client allows for arbitrary file writes with target cache path traversal
    - govulncheck incorrectly reports current version affected by this CVE
    - github.com/theupdateframework/go-tuf    v0.7.0
    - Upstream github.com/sigstore/sigstore provides negative
      security advisory: go-tuf v0.7.0 is not affected by the
      vulnerability. I've discussed this with the go-tuf
      maintainers and they'll be updated the GHSA. We will not be
      updating this Sigstore TUF client to go-tuf v2 as we have
      already rewritten the client. Use
      https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/sigstore/sigstore-go/pkg/tuf
      instead, which is based on go-tuf v2. Link:
      https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore/issues/1857#issuecomment-2407159536
    - NB: This negative security advisory is exactly the use case
      for vexctl and openVEX documents. Wide adoption across the Go
      ecosystem is pending waiting for updated purl (Package URL)
      specification for precise spelling of Go module versions.
