    <comment>New package vexctl version 0.3.0 is a CLI tool to create, apply, and attest VEX (Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange) data. Its purpose is to help with the creation and management of VEX documents that allow &quot;turning off&quot; security scanner alerts of vulnerabilities known not to affect a product.

VEX can be thought of as a &quot;negative security advisory&quot;. Using VEX, software authors can communicate to their users that an otherwise vulnerable component has no security implications for their product.</comment>

    <comment>- Update to version 0.3.0+git133.ff97560:
  * Upstream has not had a recent tagged release to pick up
    dependency updates committed to main branch.
- Packaging improvements:
  * _service tar_scm set revision to branch main until upstream
    next has a tagged release
  * _service tar_scm when revision is a branch name e.g. master
    use versionformat @PARENT_TAG@+git@TAG_OFFSET@.%h to represent
    git commit history included beyond last tagged release. Archive
    name will be: name-X.Y.Z+gitN.shortsha.tar.gz. When upstream
    project resumes tagged releases drop the param versionformat
    and restore revision to tag name e.g. vX.Y.Z.
  * Update to BuildRequires: golang(API) &gt;= 1.24 matching go.mod
  * %install remove extraneous comment and dest path quoting (forwarded request 1286233 from jfkw)</comment>
