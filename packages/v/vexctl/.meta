  <description>vexctl is a CLI tool to create, apply, and attest VEX (Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange) data. Its purpose is to help with the creation and management of VEX documents that allow &quot;turning off&quot; security scanner alerts of vulnerabilities known not to affect a product.

  VEX can be thought of as a &quot;negative security advisory&quot;. Using VEX, software authors can communicate to their users that an otherwise vulnerable component has no security implications for their product.</description>
