%description
vexctl is a CLI tool to create, apply, and attest VEX (Vulnerability
Exploitability eXchange) data. Its purpose is to help with the creation and
management of VEX documents that allow "turning off" security scanner alerts of
vulnerabilities known not to affect a product.

VEX can be thought of as a "negative security advisory". Using VEX, software
authors can communicate to their users that an otherwise vulnerable component
has no security implications for their product.
