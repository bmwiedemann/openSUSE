- Update to version 1.12.0:
  very big changelog, please find it here:
  https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero/releases/tag/v1.12.0

  * Breaking changes
    - Prior to v1.12, the parameter uploader-type for Velero
      installation had a default value of "restic". However,
      starting from this version, the default value has been
      changed to "kopia". This means that Velero will now use Kopia
      as the default path for file system backup.
    - The ways of setting CSI snapshot time have changed in v1.12.
      First, the sync waiting time for creating a snapshot handle
      in the CSI plugin is changed from the fixed 10 minutes into
      backup.Spec.CSISnapshotTimeout. The second, the async waiting
      time for VolumeSnapshot and VolumeSnapshotContent's status
      turning into ReadyToUse in operation uses the operation's
      timeout. The default value is 4 hours.
    - As from Velero helm chart v4.0.0, it supports multiple BSL
      and VSL, and the BSL and VSL have changed from the map into a
      slice, and this breaking change is not backward compatible.
      So it would be best to change the BSL and VSL configuration
      into slices before the Upgrade.
    - Prior to v1.12, deleting the Velero namespace would easily
      remove all the resources within it. However, with the
      introduction of finalizers attached to the Velero CR
      including restore, dataupload, and datadownload in this
      version, directly deleting Velero namespace may get stuck
      indefinitely because the pods responsible for handling the
      finalizers might be deleted before the resources attached to
      the finalizers. To avoid this issue, please use the command
      velero uninstall to delete all the Velero resources or ensure
      that you handle the finalizer appropriately before deleting
      the Velero namespace.

  * Limitations/Known issues
    The Azure plugin supports Azure AD Workload identity way, but
    it only works for Velero native snapshots. It cannot support
    filesystem backup and snapshot data mover scenarios.

Thu Sep 07 11:41:23 UTC 2023 - kastl@b1-systems.de

- Update to version 1.11.0:
  very big changelog, please find it here:
  https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero/releases/tag/v1.11.0

  * Breaking changes
    The Velero CSI plugin now determines whether to restore
    Volume's data from snapshots on the restore's restorePVs
    setting. Before v1.11, the CSI plugin doesn't check the
    restorePVs parameter setting.

  * Upgrading
    Due to the major changes of file system backup, the old upgrade
    steps are not suitable any more.

    * bug fix: save PodVolumeBackup manifests to object storage even if the volume was empty, so that on restore, the PV is dynamically reprovisioned if applicable (#2390, @skriss)
    * Adding new restoreItemAction for PVC to update the selected-node annotation (#2377, @mynktl)
    * Added a --cacert flag to the install command to provide the CA bundle to use when verifying TLS connections to object storage (#2368, @mansam)
    * Added a --cacert flag to the velero client describe, download, and logs commands to allow passing a path to a certificate to use when verifying TLS connections to object storage. Also added a corresponding client config option called cacert which takes a path to a certificate bundle to use as a default when --cacert is not specified. (#2364, @mansam)
    * support setting a custom CA certificate on a BSL to use when verifying TLS connections (#2353, @mansam)
    * adding annotations on backup CRD for k8s major, minor and git versions (#2346, @brito-rafa)
    * When the EnableCSI feature flag is provided, upload CSI VolumeSnapshots and VolumeSnapshotContents to object storage as gzipped JSON. (#2323, @nrb)
    * add CSI snapshot API types into default restore priorities (#2318, @ashish-amarnath)
    * refactoring: wait for all informer caches to sync before running controllers (#2299, @skriss)
    * refactor restore code to lazily resolve resources via discovery and eliminate second restore loop for instances of restored CRDs (#2248, @skriss)
    * upgrade to go 1.14 and migrate from dep to go modules (#2214, @skriss)
    * clarify the wording for restore describe for namespaces included
  - v1.3.2
    * Allow plugins/ as a valid top-level directory within backup storage locations. This directory is a place for plugin authors to store arbitrary data as needed. It is recommended to create an additional subdirectory under plugins/ specifically for your plugin, e.g. plugins/my-plugin-data/. (#2350, @skriss)
    * bug fix: don't panic in velero restic repo get when last maintenance time is nil (#2315, @skriss)
