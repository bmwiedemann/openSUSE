    * refactoring: wait for all informer caches to sync before running controllers (#2299, @skriss)
    * refactor restore code to lazily resolve resources via discovery and eliminate second restore loop for instances of restored CRDs (#2248, @skriss)
    * upgrade to go 1.14 and migrate from dep to go modules (#2214, @skriss)
    * clarify the wording for restore describe for namespaces included
  - v1.3.2
    * Allow plugins/ as a valid top-level directory within backup storage locations. This directory is a place for plugin authors to store arbitrary data as needed. It is recommended to create an additional subdirectory under plugins/ specifically for your plugin, e.g. plugins/my-plugin-data/. (#2350, @skriss)
    * bug fix: don't panic in velero restic repo get when last maintenance time is nil (#2315, @skriss)
