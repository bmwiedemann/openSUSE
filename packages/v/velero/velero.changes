Tue Nov 12 06:24:04 UTC 2024 - opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de

- Update to version 1.15.0:
  Changelog: https://velero.io/docs/v1.15/
  Upgrading: https://velero.io/docs/v1.15/upgrade-to-1.15/
  * Data mover micro service
    Data transfer activities for CSI Snapshot Data Movement are
    moved from node-agent pods to dedicate backupPods or
    restorePods. This brings many benefits such as:
    - This avoids to access volume data through host path, while
      host path access is privileged and may involve security
      escalations, which are concerned by users.
    - This enables users to to control resource (i.e., cpu, memory)
      allocations in a granular manner, e.g., control them per
      backup/restore of a volume.
    - This enhances the resilience, crash of one data movement
      activity won't affect others.
    - This prevents unnecessary full backup because of host path
      changes after workload pods restart.
    - For more information, check the design
      https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero/blob/main/design/Implemented/vgdp-micro-service/vgdp-micro-service.md.
  * Item Block concepts and ItemBlockAction (IBA) plugin
    Item Block concepts are introduced for resource backups to help
    to achieve multiple thread backups. Specifically, correlated
    resources are categorized in the same item block and item
    blocks could be processed concurrently in multiple threads.
    ItemBlockAction plugin is introduced to help Velero to
    categorize resources into item blocks. At present, Velero
    provides built-in IBAs for pods and PVCs and Velero also
    supports customized IBAs for any resources.
    In v1.15, Velero doesn't support multiple thread process of
    item blocks though item block concepts and IBA plugins are
    fully supported. The multiple thread support will be delivered
    in future releases.
    For more information, check the design
    https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero/blob/main/design/backup-performance-improvements.md.
  * Node selection for repository maintenance job
    Repository maintenance are resource consuming tasks, Velero now
    allows you to configure the nodes to run repository maintenance
    jobs, so that you can run repository maintenance jobs in idle
    nodes or avoid them to run in nodes hosting critical workloads.
    To support the configuration, a new repository maintenance
    configuration configMap is introduced.
    For more information, check the document
    https://velero.io/docs/v1.15/repository-maintenance/.
  * Backup PVC read-only configuration
    In 1.15, Velero allows you to configure the data mover
    backupPods to read-only mount the backupPVCs. In this way, the
    data mover expose process could be significantly accelerated
    for some storages (i.e., ceph).
    To support the configuration, a new backup PVC configuration
    configMap is introduced.
    For more information, check the document
    https://velero.io/docs/v1.15/data-movement-backup-pvc-configuration/.
  * Backup PVC storage class configuration
    In 1.15, Velero allows you to configure the storageclass used
    by the data mover backupPods. In this way, the provision of
    backupPVCs don't need to adhere to the same pattern as workload
    PVCs, e.g., for a backupPVC, it only needs one replica,
    whereas, the a workload PVC may have multiple replicas.
    To support the configuration, the same backup PVC configuration
    configMap is used.
    For more information, check the document
    https://velero.io/docs/v1.15/data-movement-backup-pvc-configuration/.
 * Backup repository data cache configuration
    The backup repository may need to cache data on the client side
    during various repository operations, i.e., read, write,
    maintenance, etc. The cache consumes the root file system space
    of the pod where the repository access happens.
    In 1.15, Velero allows you to configure the total size of the
    cache per repository. In this way, if your pod doesn't have
    enough space in its root file system, the pod won't be evicted
    due to running out of ephemeral storage.
    To support the configuration, a new backup repository
    configuration configMap is introduced.
    For more information, check the document
    https://velero.io/docs/v1.15/backup-repository-configuration/.
  * Performance improvements
    In 1.15, several performance related issues/enhancements are
    included, which makes significant performance improvements in
    specific scenarios:
    - There was a memory leak of Velero server after plugin calls,
      now it is fixed, see issue #7925
    - The client-burst/client-qps parameters are automatically
      inherited to plugins, so that you can use the same velero
      server parameters to accelerate the plugin executions when
      large number of API server calls happen, see issue #7806
    - Maintenance of Kopia repository takes huge memory in
      scenarios that huge number of files have been backed up,
      Velero 1.15 has included the Kopia upstream enhancement to
      fix the problem, see issue #7510

  commit hash required by the ldflags

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun 17 19:16:43 UTC 2024 - opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de

- Update to version 1.14.0:
  * Highlights
    - The maintenance work for kopia/restic backup repositories is
      run in jobs
      Since velero started using kopia as the approach for
      filesystem-level backup/restore, we've noticed an issue when
      velero connects to the kopia backup repositories and performs
      maintenance, it sometimes consumes excessive memory that can
      cause the velero pod to get OOM Killed. To mitigate this
      issue, the maintenance work will be moved out of velero pod
      to a separate kubernetes job, and the user will be able to
      specify the resource request in "velero install".
    - Volume Policies are extended to support more actions to
      handle volumes
      In an earlier release, a flexible volume policy was
      introduced to skip certain volumes from a backup. In v1.14
      we've made enhancement to this policy to allow the user to
      set how the volumes should be backed up. The user will be
      able to set "fs-backup" or "snapshot" as value of “action" in
      the policy and velero will backup the volumes accordingly.
      This enhancement allows the user to achieve a fine-grained
      control like "opt-in/out" without having to update the target
      workload. For more details please refer to
      https://velero.io/docs/v1.14/resource-filtering/#supported-volumepolicy-actions
    - Node Selection for Data Movement Backup
      In velero the data movement flow relies on datamover pods,
      and these pods may take substantial resources and keep
      running for a long time. In v1.14, the user will be able to
      create a configmap to define the eligible nodes on which the
      datamover pods are launched. For more details refer to
      https://velero.io/docs/v1.14/data-movement-backup-node-selection/
    - VolumeInfo metadata for restored volumes
      In v1.13, we introduced volumeinfo metadata for backup to
      help velero CLI and downstream adopter understand how velero
      handles each volume during backup. In v1.14, similar metadata
      will be persisted for each restore. velero CLI is also
      updated to bring more info in the output of "velero restore
      describe".
    - "Finalizing" phase is introduced to restores
      The "Finalizing" phase is added to the state transition flow
      to restore, which helps us fix several issues: The labels
      added to PVs will be restored after the data in the PV is
      restored via volumesnapshotter. The post restore hook will be
      executed after datamovement is finished.
    - Certificate-based authentication support for Azure
      Besides the service principal with secret(password)-based
      authentication, Velero introduces the new support for service
      principal with certificate-based authentication in v1.14.0.
      This approach enables you to adopt a phishing resistant
      authentication by using conditional access policies, which
      better protects Azure resources and is the recommended way by
      Azure.
  * Runtime and dependencies
    - Golang runtime: v1.22.2
    - kopia: v0.17.0
  * Limitations/Known issues
    - For the external BackupItemAction plugins that take snapshots
      for PVs, such as vsphere plugin. If the plugin checks the
      value of the field "snapshotVolumes" in the backup spec as a
      criteria for snapshot, the settings in the volume policy will
      not take effect. For example, if the "snapshotVolumes" is set
      to False in the backup spec, but a volume meets the condition
      in the volume policy for "snapshot" action, because the
      plugin will not check the settings in the volume policy, the
      plugin will not take snapshot for the volume. For more
      details please refer to #7818
  * Breaking changes
    - CSI plugin has been merged into velero repo in v1.14 release.
      It will be installed by default as an internal plugin, and
      should not be installed via "–plugins " parameter in "velero
      install" command.
    - The default resource requests and limitations for node agent
      are removed in v1.14, to make the node agent pods have the
      QoS class of "BestEffort", more details please refer to #7391
    - There's a change in namespace filtering behavior during
      backup: In v1.14, when the
      includedNamespaces/excludedNamespaces fields are not set and
      the labelSelector/OrLabelSelectors are set in the backup
      spec, the backup will only include the namespaces which
      contain the resources that match the label selectors, while
      in previous releases all namespaces will be included in the
      backup with such settings. More details refer to #7105
    - Patching the PV in the "Finalizing" state may cause the
      restore to be in "PartiallyFailed" state when the PV is
      blocked in "Pending" state, while in the previous release the
      restore may end up being in "Complete" state. For more
      details refer to #7866

Mon Jan 29 17:38:32 UTC 2024 - opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de

- BuildRequire go1.21
- Update to version 1.13.0:
  * Upgrading
    https://velero.io/docs/v1.13/upgrade-to-1.13/
  * Resource Modifier Enhancement
    - Velero introduced the Resource Modifiers in v1.12.0. This
      feature allows users to specify a ConfigMap with a set of
      rules to modify the resources during restoration. However,
      only the JSON Patch is supported when creating the rules, and
      JSON Patch has some limitations, which cannot cover all use
      cases. In v1.13.0, Velero adds new support for JSON Merge
      Patch and Strategic Merge Patch, which provide more power and
      flexibility and allow users to use the same ConfigMap to
      apply patches on the resources. More design details can be
      found in Support JSON Merge Patch and Strategic Merge Patch
      in Resource Modifiers design. For instructions on how to use
      the feature, please refer to the Resource Modifiers doc.
  * Node-Agent Concurrency
    - Velero data movement activities from fs-backups and CSI
      snapshot data movements run in Velero node-agent, so may be
      hosted by every node in the cluster and consume resources
      (i.e. CPU, memory, network bandwidth) from there. With v1.13,
      users are allowed to configure how many data movement
      activities (a.k.a, loads) run in each node globally or by
      node, so that users can better leverage the performance of
      Velero data movement activities and the resource consumption
      in the cluster. For more information, check the Node-Agent
      Concurrency document.
  * Parallel Files Upload Options
    - Velero now supports configurable options for parallel files
      upload when using Kopia uploader to do fs-backups or CSI
      snapshot data movements which makes speed up backup possible.
  * Write Sparse Files Options
    - If using fs-restore or CSI snapshot data movements, it’s
      supported to write sparse files during restore. For more
      information, please check Here.
  * Backup Describe
    - In v1.13, the Backup Volume section is added to the velero
      backup describe command output. The backup Volumes section
      describes information for all the volumes included in the
      backup of various backup types, i.e. native snapshot,
      fs-backup, CSI snapshot, and CSI snapshot data movement.
      Particularly, the velero backup description now supports
      showing the information of CSI snapshot data movements, which
      is not supported in v1.12.
      Additionally, backup describe command will not check
      EnableCSI feature gate from client side, so if a backup has
      volumes with CSI snapshot or CSI snapshot data movement,
      backup describe command always shows the corresponding
      information in its output.
  * Backup's new VolumeInfo metadata
    - Create a new metadata file in the backup repository's backup
      name sub-directory to store the backup-including PVC and PV
      information. The information includes the backing-up method
      of the PVC and PV data, snapshot information, and status. The
      VolumeInfo metadata file determines how the PV resource
      should be restored. The Velero downstream software can also
      use this metadata file to get a summary of the backup's
      volume data information.
  * Enhancement for CSI Snapshot Data Movements when Velero Pod
    Restart
    - When performing backup and restore operations, enhancements
      have been implemented for Velero server pods or node agents
      to ensure that the current backup or restore process is not
      stuck or interrupted after restart due to certain exceptional
      circumstances.
  * New status fields added to show hook execution details
    - Hook execution status is now included in the backup/restore
      CR status and displayed in the backup/restore describe
      command output. Specifically, it will show the number of
      hooks which attempted to execute under the HooksAttempted
      field and the number of hooks which failed to execute under
      the HooksFailed field.
  * AWS SDK Bump Up
    - Bump up AWS SDK for Go to version 2, which offers significant
      performance improvements in CPU and memory utilization over
      version 1.
  * Azure AD/Workload Identity Support
    - Azure AD/Workload Identity is the recommended approach to do
      the authentication with Azure services/AKS, Velero has
      introduced support for Azure AD/Workload Identity on the
      Velero Azure plugin side in previous releases, and in v1.13.0
      Velero adds new support for Kopia operations(file system
      backup/data mover/etc.) with Azure AD/Workload Identity.
  * Runtime and dependencies
    To fix CVEs and keep pace with Golang, Velero made changes as
    follows:
    - Bump Golang runtime to v1.21.6.
    - Bump several dependent libraries to new versions.
    - Bump Kopia to v0.15.0.
  * Breaking changes
    - Backup describe command: due to the backup describe output
      enhancement, some existing information (i.e. the output for
      native snapshot, CSI snapshot, and fs-backup) has been moved
      to the Backup Volumes section with some format changes.
    - API type changes: changes the field DataMoverConfig in
      DataUploadSpec from `*map[string][string]` to
      map[string]string`
    - Velero install command: due to the issue #7264, v1.13.0
      introduces a break change that make the informer cache
      enabled by default to keep the actual behavior consistent
      with the helper message(the informer cache is disabled by
      default before the change).
  * Limitations/Known issues
    - The backup's VolumeInfo metadata doesn't have the information
      updated in the async operations. This function could be
      supported in v1.14 release.
  * Note
    - Velero introduces the informer cache which is enabled by
      default. The informer cache improves the restore performance
      but may cause higher memory consumption. Increase the memory
      limit of the Velero pod or disable the informer cache by
      specifying the --disable-informer-cache option when
      installing Velero if you get the OOM error.
  * Deprecation announcement
    - The generated k8s clients, informers, and listers are
      deprecated in the Velero v1.13 release. They are put in the
      Velero repository's pkg/generated directory. According to the
      n+2 supporting policy, the deprecated are kept for two more
      releases. The pkg/generated directory should be deleted in
      the v1.15 release.
    - After the backup VolumeInfo metadata file is added to the
      backup, Velero decides how to restore the PV resource
      according to the VolumeInfo content. To support the backup
      generated by the older version of Velero, the old logic is
      also kept. The support for the backup without the VolumeInfo
      metadata file will be kept for two releases. The support
      logic will be deleted in the v1.15 release.

Fri Sep 22 08:29:04 UTC 2023 - kastl@b1-systems.de

- Update to version 1.12.0:
  very big changelog, please find it here:
  https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero/releases/tag/v1.12.0

  * Breaking changes
    - Prior to v1.12, the parameter uploader-type for Velero
      installation had a default value of "restic". However,
      starting from this version, the default value has been
      changed to "kopia". This means that Velero will now use Kopia
      as the default path for file system backup.
    - The ways of setting CSI snapshot time have changed in v1.12.
      First, the sync waiting time for creating a snapshot handle
      in the CSI plugin is changed from the fixed 10 minutes into
      backup.Spec.CSISnapshotTimeout. The second, the async waiting
      time for VolumeSnapshot and VolumeSnapshotContent's status
      turning into ReadyToUse in operation uses the operation's
      timeout. The default value is 4 hours.
    - As from Velero helm chart v4.0.0, it supports multiple BSL
      and VSL, and the BSL and VSL have changed from the map into a
      slice, and this breaking change is not backward compatible.
      So it would be best to change the BSL and VSL configuration
      into slices before the Upgrade.
    - Prior to v1.12, deleting the Velero namespace would easily
      remove all the resources within it. However, with the
      introduction of finalizers attached to the Velero CR
      including restore, dataupload, and datadownload in this
      version, directly deleting Velero namespace may get stuck
      indefinitely because the pods responsible for handling the
      finalizers might be deleted before the resources attached to
      the finalizers. To avoid this issue, please use the command
      velero uninstall to delete all the Velero resources or ensure
      that you handle the finalizer appropriately before deleting
      the Velero namespace.

  * Limitations/Known issues
    The Azure plugin supports Azure AD Workload identity way, but
    it only works for Velero native snapshots. It cannot support
    filesystem backup and snapshot data mover scenarios.

Thu Sep 07 11:41:23 UTC 2023 - kastl@b1-systems.de

- Update to version 1.11.0:
  very big changelog, please find it here:
  https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero/releases/tag/v1.11.0

  * Breaking changes
    The Velero CSI plugin now determines whether to restore
    Volume's data from snapshots on the restore's restorePVs
    setting. Before v1.11, the CSI plugin doesn't check the
    restorePVs parameter setting.

  * Upgrading
    Due to the major changes of file system backup, the old upgrade
    steps are not suitable any more.

    * Adjust restic default time out to 4 hours and base pod resource requests to 500m CPU/512Mi memory. (#2696, @nrb)
    * capture version of the CRD prior before invoking the remap_crd_version backup item action (#2683, @ashish-amarnath)
  - v1.4.0
    * increment restic volumesnapshot count after successful pvb create (#2542, @ashish-amarnath)
    * Add details of CSI volumesnapshotcontents associated with a backup to velero backup describe when the EnableCSI feature flag is given on the velero client. (#2448, @nrb)
    * Allow users the option to retrieve all versions of a given resource (instead of just the preferred version) from the API server with the EnableAPIGroupVersions feature flag. (#2373, @brito-rafa)
    * Changed backup tarball format to store all versions of a given resource, updated backup tarball format to 1.1.0. (#2373, @brito-rafa)

    * sync backups' CSI API objects into the cluster as part of the backup sync controller (#2496, @ashish-amarnath)
    * bug fix: in error location logging hook, if the item logged under the error key doesn't implement the error interface, don't return an error since this is a valid scenario (#2487, @skriss)
    * bug fix: in CRD restore plugin, don't use runtime.DefaultUnstructuredConverter.FromUnstructured(...) to avoid conversion issues when float64 fields contain int values (#2484, @skriss)
    * during backup deletion also delete CSI volumesnapshotcontents that were created as a part of the backup but the associated volumesnapshot object does not exist (#2480, @ashish-amarnath)
    * If plugins don't support the --features flag, don't pass it to them. Also, update the standard plugin server to ignore unknown flags. (#2479, @skriss)
    * At backup time, if a CustomResourceDefinition appears to have been created via the v1beta1 endpoint, retrieve it from the v1beta1 endpoint instead of simply changing the APIVersion. (#2478, @nrb)
    * update container base images from ubuntu:bionic to ubuntu:focal (#2471, @skriss)
    * bug fix: when a resource includes/excludes list contains unresolvable items, don't remove them from the list, so that the list doesn't inadvertently end up matching all resources. (#2462, @skriss)
    * Azure: add support for getting storage account key for restic directly from an environment variable (#2455, @jaygridley)

    * bump Kubernetes module dependencies to v0.17.4 to get fix for kubernetes/kubernetes#86149 (#2407, @skriss)
    * bug fix: save PodVolumeBackup manifests to object storage even if the volume was empty, so that on restore, the PV is dynamically reprovisioned if applicable (#2390, @skriss)
    * Adding new restoreItemAction for PVC to update the selected-node annotation (#2377, @mynktl)
    * Added a --cacert flag to the install command to provide the CA bundle to use when verifying TLS connections to object storage (#2368, @mansam)
    * Added a --cacert flag to the velero client describe, download, and logs commands to allow passing a path to a certificate to use when verifying TLS connections to object storage. Also added a corresponding client config option called cacert which takes a path to a certificate bundle to use as a default when --cacert is not specified. (#2364, @mansam)
    * support setting a custom CA certificate on a BSL to use when verifying TLS connections (#2353, @mansam)
    * adding annotations on backup CRD for k8s major, minor and git versions (#2346, @brito-rafa)

It is recommended to create an additional subdirectory under plugins/ specifically for your plugin, e.g. plugins/my-plugin-data/. (#2350, @skriss)
    * bug fix: don't panic in velero restic repo get when last maintenance time is nil (#2315, @skriss)
