- Update to 0.9:

## [0.9] - 2024-05-01

This release has been long in the works but its time now. There
have been many additions and bugfixes since 0.8. In particular
changes to the Lua API have made it easier to extend `vis` in all
sorts of ways that were previously difficult or impossible. As
always the appreciation towards contributors new and old can not
be understated; thanks goes out to everyone for their efforts!

A summary of changes follows:

### Core

- Compare non-existing files by name and existing files by inode
- Do tilde expansion only for the tilde character at the beginning of the pattern.
- Add word wrapping via breakat and wrapcolumn options
- Add ansi escaping values and theming keyword for dimmed text
- Allow statusbar to disabled
- Default theme was changed to one that uses the terminal colors directly.

### Lua

- filetype: support filetype detection via hashbang
- filetype: many new file extensions are covered
- Resync the lexers with Scintillua
- Implement Selection:remove()
- Allow underscore (_) in command names
- Allow nil in vis:pipe() File and Range parameters
- Add fullscreen param to vis_pipe_collect() and vis:pipe()
- Access and set all available editor options
- Implementation of the non-blocking process running Lua API
- Make expandtab and tabwidth options window-local
- Drop redrawtime option
- Add a Lua constant for UI_STYLE_LEXER_MAX
- Report viewport as lines in addition to bytes
- Add `win:style_pos()` for styling a specific window cell.
- Add `UI_DRAW` event for last minute changes to the drawn window.
- Report viewport dimensions

### Misc

- Add a basic .editorconfig file
- Don't set _FORTIFY_SOURCE in configure
- Many documentation improvements.
- Make vis-open and vis-complete more POSIX compliant
- vis-clipboard: clean up bashisms and make shellcheck happy.
- vis-clipboard: add support for wayclip
- vis-open: allow to show files vertically

### Bugfixes

- fix warning by dealing with error value from fchdir in text-io.c
- text-io: close "cwd" in all cases
- vis-complete: Fix commandline options handling
- vis-clipboard: make xsel honor --selection
- wl-paste and wl-copy should not add \n to the end of the clipboard.
- fix a bug with using regex to close windows (i.e. `:X/re/q`)
- Limit to lines within range for inner text objects
- vis-clipboard: don't fail when sel is primary on unsupported platforms
- fix { moving back too much if cursor is at start of a line
- Print keybindings containing space correctly in help window
- Prevent flickering in curses
- vis-menu: try to preserve valid Unicode points
- lua: make sure lpeg is in fact optional
- vis-single: respect TMPDIR
- lua: fail when mapping a key to an invalid handler type
- vis_pipe: correctly return non-zero exit status
- view: skip empty cells before applying a style
- sam: reject invalid ranges for cmd_extract ("x"/"y")
- Fix upper/lower case conversions with `gU` and `gu`.
- lua: complete-word: use internal regex for splitting words
- Theme application was refactored and should be more consistent now.

### Deprecation Notices

The option names `show-spaces`, `show-tabs`, `show-newlines`,
`show-eof`, and `change-256colors` are all deprecated and will be
removed for the next release, use the name without the `-` instead
(e.g. showeof). This was done to avoid inconsistencies between the
lua option names and the `:set option` names.
