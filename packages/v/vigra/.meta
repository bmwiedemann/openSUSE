  <title>Computer vision Library</title>
  <description>VIGRA stands for &quot;Vision with Generic Algorithms&quot;. It is a novel
computer vision library that puts its main emphasis on customizable
algorithms and data structures. By using template techniques similar to
those in the C++ Standard Template Library, you can easily adapt any
VIGRA component to the needs of your application, without giving up
execution speed.</description>
