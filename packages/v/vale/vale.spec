%description
Vale is a command-line tool that brings code-like linting to prose. It's fast,
cross-platform (Windows, macOS, and Linux), and highly customizable.

Vale has support for markup: Vale has a rich understanding of many markup
formats, allowing it to avoid syntax-related false positives and intelligently
exclude code snippets from prose-related rules.

Vale includes a highly customizable extension system capable of enforcing your
style-be it a standard editorial style guide or a custom in-house set of rules
(such as those created by GitLab, Homebrew, Linode, CockroachDB, and Spotify).
