Wed Nov 27 19:49:17 UTC 2024 - Michael Hamilton <michael@actrix.gen.nz>

- Version 2.1.2
  * Replace the Preset-scheduler with an implementation that remains accurate after PC-sleep/hibernation.
  * Fix the day-rollover which was scheduling for the wrong day if triggered at 12:59:59. 
  * When performing a set-vcp, don't increment the NVRAM write count if the VDU doesn't respond.
  * When reconfiguring VDU controllers, discard pending VDU VCP changes from previous controllers. 
  * Eliminate a potential for deadlock when handling change-events from ddcutil-service.
  * Better handle ddcutil-service unexpected event types (don't raise an error dialog).
  * The main window height will now automatically resize to accommodate the number of controls present.
  * Toggling lux brightness-interpolation now immediately updates the profile-plot to reflect the change.
  * Fix the Lux Dialog, it was turning off interpolation when first constructed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Oct 13 23:42:30 UTC 2024 - Michael Hamilton <michael@actrix.gen.nz>

- Version 2.1.1
  * Removed --dbus-signals-enabled. DBus signals are now always enabled when --dbus-client
    is enabled.
  * Fix the active Preset icon display which was sometimes incorrect after DPMS-sleep or errors. 
  * Fix a code regression when handling non-DDC-capable VDUs (fix status=-3020 exception).
  * The About-Window now includes counts of set_vcp/NVRAM-writes for each VDU.
  * Hovering over a VDU-name in the main-window reveals the write count for that VDU.
  * Minor changes to reduce unnecessary work and improve log messages.
  
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Sep 28 00:53:40 UTC 2024 - Michael Hamilton <michael@actrix.gen.nz>

- Version 2.1.0
  * Preset transitions have been deprecated.  All presets are now restored instantly no 
    matter how they have been set to transition.  The Preset-Dialog controls for assigning
    transitions have been hidden.  All  transition related code may be removed in a future 
    version, please contact me or comment on issue #93 if you prefer transitions to be retained.
  * Transitions and related controls can be re-enabled by disabling `protect-nvram` in the
    Settings-Dialog. 
  * To avoid unnecessary updates, preset restoration now queries the VDU's existing
    values. This may slow down preset restoration.
  * Lux-metered auto adjustment has been defaulted to 10 minute intervals (up from 5).
  * Color-Preset (VCP code 0x14) has been added to the list of standard controls.
  * Added a VDU Initializer-Preset feature to provide a replacement for dead NVRAM.
    This also provides a way to restore settings not persisted in VDU NVRAM.  A VDU's 
    initializer-preset is automatically run if the target VDU is present at startup or 
    is subsequently detected. Any preset that has a name that matches a VDU model and
    serial-number will be treated as an Initializer-Preset. 
  * The Preset-Dialog now includes a tool-button  to the right of the preset-name entry 
    that will create a VDU specific Initializer-Preset. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug 22 01:21:40 UTC 2024 - Michael Hamilton <michael@actrix.gen.nz>

- Version 2.0.4
  * The About-Dialog now refreshes the ddcutil version info on each invocation. 
  * Increased dbus timeout to 10 seconds (in case numerous VDUs or errors slow down VDU detection).
  * Dynamically enable a scroll-area when the main-panel exceeds the available screen height. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May  6 04:18:30 UTC 2024 - Michael Hamilton <michael@actrix.gen.nz>

- Version 2.0.3
  * Reduce the number of writes to VDU NVRAM by sliders, spinners, and ambient brightness adjustments.
    * Slider and spin-box controls now only update the VDU when adjustments become slow or stop (when 
      the control value remains constant for 0.5 seconds).
    * Spin-Boxes now select the entire text on focus in (enables easier overtyping and decreases VDU updates).
    * Ambient lighting initiated changes in brightness of up to 20% are applied without any transitional 
      steps (plus the existing code ignores updates of less than 10%). 
    * Set the default ambient-light brightness adjustment-interval to 5 minutes.
  * React to DPMS awake signal from ddcutil-service by re-assessing ambient brightness.
  * Simplified locking and conformed to a locking hierarchy/protocol to avoid potential deadlocks. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Apr 13 02:01:37 UTC 2024 - Michael Hamilton <michael@actrix.gen.nz>

- Version 2.0.2
  * Added a *refresh* annotation suffix for use with VCP-codes which cause multiple changes.
  * Make manual adjustment of the ambient Light Level more accurate and responsive.
  * Updates are sent to the VDU as sliders are dragged (rather than only on release).
  * Fix exception on monitors that return invalid/unexpected combo-box VCP values.
  * Fix exception on monitors with blank VCP value descriptions.
  * When refresh is pressed, only auto adjust ambient brightness if auto-brightness is enabled.
  * Don't automatically refresh on error, eliminate popup dialog loops.
  * Eliminate deadlocks when exceptions occur.
  * Cleanup the initialisation of the ddcutil-service connection.
  * Add more caveats and limitations to the documentation.
  * Fix manual ambient light slider when light meter is uninitialized.
  * Promote Simple-Non-Continuous values whose metadata exceeds one-byte to two-byte Complex-NC.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

  * Fix infinite-loop when altering an existing FIFO lux-meter in the Lux-Dialog.
  * Fix the refresh of the LuxDialog meter-readout/plot when changing to a new meter.
  * Apply context-aware defaults to the LuxDialog device file-chooser.

  * When a Preset is transitioning slowly (i.e. not immediately), the UI controls can be used to stop the transition.
  * Considerable internal refactoring of option handling.
