%description -n %lname
volk is a meta loader for Vulkan. It loads entrypoints required to
use Vulkan by means of dlopen-ing libvulkan.so.1. volk simplifies the
use of Vulkan extensions by loading all associated entrypoints. volk
enables loading Vulkan entrypoints directly from the driver which can
increase performance by skipping loader dispatch overhead.
