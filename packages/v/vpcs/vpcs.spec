%description
The VPCS can simulate up to 9 PCs. You can ping/traceroute them, or ping/traceroute
the other hosts/routers from the virtual PCs when you study the Cisco routers in
the Dynamips. VPCS is not the traditional PC, it is just a program running on the
Linux or Windows, and only few network commands can be used in it. But VPCS can
give you a big hand when you study the Cisco devices in the Dynamips. VPCS can
replace the routers or VMware boxes which are used as PCs in the Dynamips network.

Try VPCS, it can save your CPU/Memory. It is very small.

Now, VPCS can be run in udp or ether mode. In the udp mode, VPCS sends or receives
the packets via udp. In the ether mode, via /dev/tap, not support on the Windows.
