Fri Jun 23 19:42:07 UTC 2017 - antoine.belvire@opensuse.org

- Update to version 5.1.2:
  * Fix an endless loop in Backend Polling (#2295)
  * Fix a Chunked bug in tight workspaces (#2207, #2275)
  * Fix a bug relating to req.body when on waitinglist (#2266)
  * Handle EPIPE on broken TCP connections (#2267)
  * Work around the x86 arch's turbo-double FP format in parameter
    setup code. (#1875)
  * Fix race related to backend probe with proxy header (#2278)
  * Keep VCL temperature consistent between mgt/worker also when
    worker protests.
  * A lot of HTTP/2 fixes.
- Changes introduced by version 5.1.1:
  * Fix bug introduced by stubborn old bugger right before release
    5.1.0 was cut.
- Changes introduced by version 5.1.0:
  * Added varnishd command-line options -I, -x and -?, and
    tightened restrictions on permitted combinations of options.
  * More progress on support for HTTP/2.
  * Add ``return(fail)`` to almost all VCL subroutines.
  * Restored the old hit-for-pass, invoked with
    ``return(pass(DURATION))`` from
    ``vcl_backend_response``. hit-for-miss remains the default.
    Added the cache_hitmiss stat, and cache_hitpass only counts the
    new/old hit-for-pass cases. Restored HitPass to the Varnish
    log, and added HitMiss. Added the HFP prefix to TTL log entries
    to log a hit-for-pass duration.
  * Rolled back the fix for #1206. Client delivery decides solely
    whether to send a 304 client response, based on client request
    and response headers.
  * Added vtest.sh.
  * Added vxid as a lefthand side for VSL queries.
  * Added the setenv and write_body commands for Varnish test cases
    (VTCs). err_shell is deprecated. Also added the operators
    -cliexpect, -match and -hdrlen, and -reason replaces -msg.
    Added the ${bad_backend} macro.
  * varnishtest can be stopped with the TERM, INT and KILL signals,
    but not with HUP.
  * The fallback director has now an extra, optional parameter to
    keep using the current backend until it falls sick.
  * VMOD shared libraries are now copied to the workdir, to avoid
    problems when VMODs are updated via packaging systems.
  * Bump the VRT version to 6.0.
  * Export more symbols from libvarnishapi.so.
  * The size of the VSL log is limited to 4G-1b, placing upper
    bounds on the -l option and the vsl_space and vsm_space
    parameters.
  * Added parameters clock_step, thread_pool_reserve and
    ban_cutoff.
  * Parameters vcl_dir and vmod_dir are deprecated, use vcl_path
    and vmod_path instead.
  * All parameters are defined, even on platforms that don't
    support them. An unsupported parameter is documented as such in
    param.show. Setting such a parameter is not an error, but has
    no effect.
  * Clarified the interpretations of the + and - operators in VCL
    with operands of the various data types.
  * DURATION types may be used in boolean contexts.
  * INT, DURATION and REAL values can now be negative.
  * Response codes 1000 or greater may now be set in VCL
    internally. resp.status is delivered modulo 1000 in client
    responses.
  * IP addresses can be compared for equality in VCL.
  * Introduce the STEVEDORE data type, and the objects
    storage.SNAME in VCL. Added req.storage and beresp.storage;
    beresp.storage_hint is deprecated.
  * Retired the umem stevedore.
  * req.ttl is deprecated.
  * Added std.getenv() and std.late_100_continue().
  * The fetch_failed stat is incremented for any kind of fetch
    failure.
  * Added the stats n_test_gunzip and
    bans_lurker_obj_killed_cutoff.
  * Clarified the meanings of the %r, %{X}i and %{X}o formatters in
    varnishncsa.
- Add varnish-5.1.2-add-fallthrough-comments.patch to fix build
  with GCC 7 (boo#1041259).

- Update to new upstream release 5.0.0
- The varnishd "-u NNN" option, which may be remaining in
  /etc/sysconfig/varnish, has been replaced with "-j unix,user=NNN".
* Varnish 5.0 changes some (mostly) internal APIs and adds some
  major new features over Varnish 4.1.
* 5.0 supports jumping from the active VCL's vcl_recv{} to another
  VCL via a VCL label.
* Very Experimental HTTP/2 support
* We have added to the "directors" VMOD — an overhauled version of
  a director which was available as an out-of-tree VMOD under the
  name VSLP for a couple of years. It is basically a better hash
  director which uses consistent hashing to provide improved
  stability of backend node selection when the configuration and/or
  health state of backends changes.
* Hit-For-Pass is now actually Hit-For-Miss
* We have made the ban lurker even more efficient by example of
  some real live situations with tens of thousands of bans using
  inefficient regular expressions.
* The waitinglist logic for ESI subrequests now uses condition
  variables to trigger immediate continuation of ESI processing
  when an object being waited for becomes available.
* Backend PROXY protocol requests are now supported through the
  .proxy_header attribute of the backend definition.
* VCL files are now also being searched for in
  /usr/share/varnish/vcl if not found in /etc/varnish.
* The basic device detection vcl is now bundled with varnish.

  smuggling attacks against vulnerable backends.

* Full support for streaming objects through from the backend on a
  cache miss. Bytes will be sent to 1..n requesting clients as they
  come in from the backend server.
* Background (re)fetch of expired objects. On a cache miss where a
  stale copy is available, serve the client the stale copy while
  fetching an updated copy from the backend in the background.
* New varnishlog query language, allowing automatic grouping of
  requests when debugging ESI or a failed backend request.
* Comprehensive request timestamp and byte counters.
- Add 0001-Fail-fetch-on-malformed-Content-Length-header.patch

* Fixed an issue where the poll waiter did not timeout clients if
  all clients were idle.

Thu Aug  5 22:11:24 UTC 2010 - jengelh@medozas.de

- Update to new upstream release: 2.1.3
* fixed an off-by-one error in the ESI handling causing includes to
  fail a large part of the time.
* Avoid triggering an assert if the other end closes the connection
  while we are lingering and waiting for another request from them.
* Make it possible to specify the per-thread stack size. This might
  be useful on 32 bit systems with their limited address space.
* Persistent storage is now experimentally supported using the
  persistent stevedore. It has the same command line arguments as
  the file stevedore.
* The regular expression engine is now PCRE instead of POSIX
  regular expressions.
* Add a new hashing method called critbit. This autoscales and
  should work better on large object workloads than the classic
  hash. Critbit has been made the default hash algorithm.
* Add support for authenticating CLI connections.                             
* Add hash director that chooses which backend to use depending on
  req.hash.
* Add client director that chooses which backend to use depending
  on the client's IP address. Note that this ignores the
  X-Forwarded-For header.
* Add a timestamp to bans, so you can know how old they are.                  
* Varnish can now connect its CLI to a remote instance when
  starting up, rather than just being connected to.
* It is no longer needed to specify the maximum number of HTTP
  headers to allow from backends. This is now a run-time parameter.
* HEAD requests would be converted to GET requests too early, which
  affected pass and pipe. This has been fixed.
* Add experimental support for the Range header. This has to be
  enabled using the parameter http_range_support.
