.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Vinci computes the volume of a polytope whose vertices, defining hyperplanes
and/or incidences of vertices and facettes are stored in files following
the lrslib (by David Avis) and/or cddlib (by Komei Fukuda) polytope formats.
The vertices are supposed to be in a file with
extension '.ine', the hyperplanes in '.ext' and the incidences in '.icd' (see
the sample files 'square.ext', 'square.icd' and 'square.ine').
.PP
Its basic call is 'vinci file' where 'file' stands for the polyhedron file
name without extension, e. g. 'vinci square'. In this case the existing files
and installed additional packages are analysed and according to the problem
type an appropriate volume computation method is chosen automatically.

.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB\-m\fP [\fILABEL\fP]
Without a label, show all implement volume computation methods. With a label,
use that volume computation method.
.TP
\fB\-s\fP \fILEVEL\fP
Specify a positive integer, the number of recursion levels for which
intermediate results are stored. A higher value speeds up certain methods
considerably while needing more storage space.
.TP
\fB\-r\fP \fISEED\fP
Set the random seed used for determining the objective function for Lawrence's
formula to the specified integer.
