%description
Vegeta is a versatile HTTP load testing tool built out of a need to drill HTTP

* CLI designed with UNIX composability in mind.
* Avoids nasty Coordinated Omission.
* Extensive reporting functionality.
* Simple to use for distributed load testing.
* Easy to install and run (static binary, package managers, etc).
