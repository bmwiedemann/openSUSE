  <title>Config Manager Based on Git</title>
  <description>Version Control System for $HOME - multiple Git
repositories in $HOME vcsh allows you to have several git
repositories, all maintaining their working trees in $HOME without
clobbering each other. That, in turn, means you can have one
repository per config set (zsh, vim, ssh, etc), picking and choosing
which configs you want to use on which machine.
