  <title>Vi IMproved</title>
  <description>Vim (Vi IMproved) is an almost compatible version of the UNIX editor
vi. Almost every possible command can be performed using only ASCII
characters. Only the 'Q' command is missing (you do not need it). Many
new features have been added: multilevel undo, command line history,
file name completion, block operations, and editing of binary data.

Vi is available for the AMIGA, MS-DOS, Windows NT, and various versions
of UNIX.

For SUSE Linux, Vim is used as /usr/bin/vi.

Package vim contains the normal version of vim. To get the full runtime
environment install additionally vim-data.</description>
