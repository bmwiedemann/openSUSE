.SH NAME
vitmp \- edit temporary files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B vitmp
.RI [ "VIM options" "] " FILE ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B vitmp
is a wrapper around the VIM editor which may be used to invoke the
editor in a way that is guaranteed to be suitable for editing temporary
files used with programs such as
.BR crontab (1)
and
.BR edquota (8).
The instance of the editor that is invoked is
.IR /bin/vi .
.PP
In particular, it is guaranteed that the file, if edited, will be
overwritten in place such that the modified contents may be read back
via a previously obtained file descriptor.  Invoking the editor via
.B vitmp
also makes sure that no additional editor temporary files are used.
.PP
Please note that
.B vitmp
offers no crash recovery capabilities.  If the editor crashes during
the overwrite, data may be lost.
