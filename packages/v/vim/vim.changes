Tue Jun 30 15:14:06 UTC 2020 - Ludwig Nussel <lnussel@suse.de>

- stop owning /etc/vimrc so the old, distro provided config actually
  gets removed. Leaving it around leads to a duplicated autocmd for
  *.spec, leading to spec file template inserted twice.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun 22 15:59:31 UTC 2020 - Ludwig Nussel <lnussel@suse.de>

- own some dirs in vim-data-common so installation of vim-small
  doesn't leave not owned directories (boo#1173256)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 28 12:05:51 UTC 2020 - Ludwig Nussel <lnussel@suse.de>

- remove duplicated settings in defaults.vim from SUSE vimrc
- move SUSE vim settings to /usr in data-common package so leave
  /etc/vimrc to the admin.
- require data-common in vim-small so it gets the settings
- install spec file template as plugin as vim-small doesn't support
  it

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 21 15:16:53 UTC 2020 - Christian Boltz <suse-beta@cboltz.de>

- apparmor.vim: update from latest AppArmor 2.13 branch:
  - allow alias rules with leading whitespace
  - allow 'include if exists' rules

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 14 15:20:08 UTC 2020 - Ludwig Nussel <lnussel@suse.de>

- introduce vim-small package with reduced requirements for small
  installations.
- BuildRequire pkg-config(krb5) instead of krb5-mini to be able to
  build against Tumbleweed repo

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May  6 07:37:25 UTC 2020 - Paolo Stivanin <info@paolostivanin.com>

Fri Aug 15 11:04:07 CEST 2003 - mfabian@suse.de

- adapt vim-6.2-gvimrc-fontset.dif to the settings needed for
  a gtk2 build. For most languages it is OK to set "guifontset"
  to "monospace". But for Korean "monospace" expands to
  "Baekmuk Gulim" with our current default settings and
  this results in a very wide, broken spacing between the letters.
  As this effect happens with many CJK fonts and the Latin glyphs
  in many CJK fonts are ugly, set a good Latin font as the default
  for CJK. This latin font is automatically combined with the
  appropriate CJK font according to the rules in
  /etc/fonts/fonts.conf. I choose "Luxi\ Mono" because this
  is guaranteed to be installed always.

Sun Mar 10 16:36:46 CET 2002 - mfabian@suse.de

- fix typo in entry for Korean fontset which prevented the
  gulim fonts from being used

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar  4 18:08:40 CET 2002 - mfabian@suse.de

- change default fontset entry for Korean to prevent core dump
  in Korean locale. 
  Our previous default selected was 
  guifontset=-*-clean-bold-r-*--16-*-*-*-*-*-*-*,
             -*-gulim-medium-r-*--16-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
  but since XFree86 4.2.0 the 'clean-bold' pattern doesn't
  match any iso8859-1 font anymore. Now it matches only:
  -schumacher-clean-bold-r-normal--16-160-75-75-c-80-iso646.1991-irv
  Because of this 'gvim' can't get any usable font, and
  gui.char_width becomes 0. This leads to a division by 0
  in function gui_resize_shell().

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Mar  3 17:52:13 CET 2002 - mfabian@suse.de
