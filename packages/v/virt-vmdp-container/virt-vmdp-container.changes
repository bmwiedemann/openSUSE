- Update to version 2.5.4.3: https://github.com/SUSE/vmdp/releases/tag/v2.5.4.3
  * Media layout changes:
    . Renamed the win10-server and win10-2204 driver directories on the
      distribution media to win10-server16-19 and win10-11-server22 to better
      identify which versions of Windows that are supported by the drivers in
      that directory.
    . Added v2v_scripts directory: Contains scripts to help with the virt-v2v
      process.
    . Added virt-v2v-vmdp.sh: Copies VMDP files to the host for use with
      virt-v2v.
  * qemu-ga:
    . Update to latest code.
  * virtiofs_svc:
    . Update to latest code.
  * pvctrl.exe:
    . Add the ability to remove registry parameters for drivers.
  * virtio ring:
    . Remove viorngci.dll from vmdp. It is no longer needed.
  * setup.exe:
    . virt-v2v enhancements: Test if doing first boot and add retry setup script.
    . Handle the removal of viorngci.dll from vmdp.
    . For Windows Server 1909, install the drivers for win10-server-16-19.
    . Updated to install drivers from the new media directory layout:
      win10-server16-19 and win10-11-server22
    . When installing on Xen and it's a new install, always prompt for a reboot.
  * uninstall.exe:
    . Handle the removal of viorngci.dll from vmdp.
  * pvvxsvc.exe:
    . virt-v2v enhancements: Test if doing first boot and if vmdp setup
      previously failed. Re-extract vmdp*exe and run vmdp setup.
  * pvvxbn.sys:
    . Bug 1209311. For Xen ballooning switch the default to use
      xenstore first to determine the total number of memory pages instead of
      using the OS. If it can't get the memory pages from Xen, fall back to
      using the OS. pvctrl.exe can be used to switch the default order for
      getting the memory pages.
    . Issue a HYPERVISOR_Shutdown(SHUTDOWN_poweroff) when shutting
      down by clicking on the shutdown button.
  * virtio_fs.sys
    . Fixed memory leak.
