- Updates in VMDP-WIN-2.5.5: https://github.com/SUSE/vmdp/releases/tag/v2.5.5

- Renamed vmdp-250424 to VMDP-WiN-2.5.5.

- All drivers for Windows Server 2025 have been signed and are now supported.

- The same driver binary is used for both Windows Server 2022 and Windows
  Server 2025.  The drivers contain signatures for both versions of
  Windows Server.

- Updated driver INF files to follow driver isolation policies.

- Drivers for Windows Server 2008 R2 have been removed from this package.

- Use a common style help box for setup, uninstall, and pvctrlw.

- Media layout changes:
  - Renamed directories to better identify drivers to Windows versions:
    - win7-8r2 -> Server2008r2-Win7
    - win8-2012 -> Server2012-Win8
    - win8.1-2012r2 -> Server2012r2-Win8.1
    - win10-server16-19 -> Server2016-19-Win10
    - win10-11-server22 -> Server2022-25-Win11.
  - Removed the <win_os>\<arch>\pvvx directory and moved its contents to the
    <win_os>\<arch> directory.
  - In the root directory created a utilities directory.  Moved the x86,
    x86ex, x64, and x64ex directories into the utilities directory.

- pvvxnet.sys:
  - NDIS Poll functionality is fully supported.
  - Split event channels in now on by default for Xen environments.

- virtio_rng.sys:
   Fixed bsc#1227857 virtio_rng to correctly initialize the virtio queue
   to utilize MSI interrupts.

- setup.exe:
  - Updated setup to recognize the new media directory layout.
  - setup now installs qemu-ga by default.  If the /qemu-ga parameter is
    given, only install qemu-ga along with the virtio_serial driver if needed.
  - setup renames the \program files\vmdp\pvvx directory
    to \program files\vmdp\drivers.
  - Flush the pv log file after each write.  Helps to follow setup's progress.
  - Update setup to be able to install individual drivers.
  - Fixed possible buffer overflow error when writing out the virtio_rng
    registry entries.

- uninstall.exe
  - When uninstalling virtiofs_svc, stop the service first so that the file
    can be deleted without a reboot.  If the file is successfully removed,
    no need to prompt for a reboot.
  - Remove the virtio_rng registry entries when uninstalling virtio_rng.

- qemu-ga:
  - Update to latest code.

- virtiofs_svc:
  - Update to latest code.

- Update to version 2.5.4.3: https://github.com/SUSE/vmdp/releases/tag/v2.5.4.3
  * Media layout changes:
    . Renamed the win10-server and win10-2204 driver directories on the
      distribution media to win10-server16-19 and win10-11-server22 to better
      identify which versions of Windows that are supported by the drivers in
      that directory.
    . Added v2v_scripts directory: Contains scripts to help with the virt-v2v
      process.
    . Added virt-v2v-vmdp.sh: Copies VMDP files to the host for use with
      virt-v2v.
  * qemu-ga:
    . Update to latest code.
  * virtiofs_svc:
    . Update to latest code.
  * pvctrl.exe:
    . Add the ability to remove registry parameters for drivers.
  * virtio ring:
    . Remove viorngci.dll from vmdp. It is no longer needed.
  * setup.exe:
    . virt-v2v enhancements: Test if doing first boot and add retry setup script.
    . Handle the removal of viorngci.dll from vmdp.
    . For Windows Server 1909, install the drivers for win10-server-16-19.
    . Updated to install drivers from the new media directory layout:
      win10-server16-19 and win10-11-server22
    . When installing on Xen and it's a new install, always prompt for a reboot.
  * uninstall.exe:
    . Handle the removal of viorngci.dll from vmdp.
  * pvvxsvc.exe:
    . virt-v2v enhancements: Test if doing first boot and if vmdp setup
      previously failed. Re-extract vmdp*exe and run vmdp setup.
  * pvvxbn.sys:
    . Bug 1209311. For Xen ballooning switch the default to use
      xenstore first to determine the total number of memory pages instead of
      using the OS. If it can't get the memory pages from Xen, fall back to
      using the OS. pvctrl.exe can be used to switch the default order for
      getting the memory pages.
    . Issue a HYPERVISOR_Shutdown(SHUTDOWN_poweroff) when shutting
      down by clicking on the shutdown button.
  * virtio_fs.sys
    . Fixed memory leak.
