Wed Jan 14 16:26:33 UTC 2026 - Simon Vogl <simon.vogl@gmx.net>

- Update to version 1.18:
  - libvkd3d
    The CreateCommandList1() method of the ID3D12Device4 interface
    is implemented.
  - libvkd3d-shader
    Several new features and improvements for the HLSL source
    type:
      Flattening of branched code. I.e., code using if/else
      statements can beturned into conditional moves when that's
      either advantageous or necessary. Cases where this is
      necessary include targeting shader model 2.0 or earlier, as
      well as code using the ‘flatten’ attribute.
      More constant folding improvements. For example:
        Iasfloat(), asint(), asuint(), cos(), mad(), round(), and
        sin() operations are constant folded.
        ‘true ? x : y’ is folded to ‘x’
        ‘x ? true : false’ is folded to ‘x’
        ‘||x||’ is folded to ‘|x|’
        ‘~~x’ is folded to ‘x’
        ‘x < 0’ is folded to ‘false’ for unsigned ‘x’
      The following intrinsic functions:
        countbits()
        firstbithigh()
        firstbitlow()
        frexp()
        texCUBEbias()
      Integer-typed conditional expressions in shader model 1-3
      target profiles. Previously these were only supported in
      shader model 4+ target profiles.
      Resource loads from ‘StructuredBuffer’ resources.
      ‘centroid’ interpolation modifiers in shader model 1-3
      target profiles.
      Support for ‘_centroid’ modifier suffixes on I/O semantics.
      I.e., ‘float2 t : TEXCOORD0_centroid’ is equivalent to
      ‘centroid float2 t : TEXCOORD0’.
    The following legacy Direct3D byte-code instructions are
    implemented:
      bem
      tex
      texbem
      texbeml
      texcoord
    The experimental Metal Shading Language (MSL) target supports
    the following features:
      Compute shaders.
      Immediate-constant buffers.
      Standard, inverse, and hyperbolic trigonometric functions.
      Integer division and remainder operations.
      Floating-point remainder operations.
      Bit scanning and counting operations.
      Boolean operands, as produced by DXIL sources.
      Barrier operations.
    When the experimental MSL target is enabled, the ‘hlsl’ source
    type can be used in combination with the ‘msl’ target type to
    convert HLSL shaders to MSL.
    Signed integer operations like min() and max() are correctly
    translated from DXIL to MSL. Previously these would end up
    getting translated as unsigned operations, and would thus
    mishandle negative values.
    The experimental OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL) target
    supports the following features:
      Screen-space partial derivatives.
      sin() and cos() operations.
      Unsigned integer division and remainder operations.
      Static texel offsets on texture load operations.
      ‘SV_Coverage’ fragment shader outputs.
      ‘SV_InstanceID’ inputs.
    Textual output formats are documented to have a zero byte
    following their output. This can be convenient for passing
    such output to functions expecting a null-terminated string.
    For some output formats this was already true in earlier
    versions of vkd3d, but not guaranteed by the API.
    New interfaces:
      The vkd3d_shader_d3dbc_source_info structure extends the
      vkd3d_shader_compile_info structure, and can be used to
      specify auxiliary information for legacy Direct3D byte-code
      (‘d3dbc’) shaders that's necessary for target formats like
      SPIR-V and GLSL, but not specified by ‘d3dbc’ shaders.
      In particular, it allows specifying resource/sampler types
      for shader model 1 fragment shaders, as well as which
      samplers are comparison-mode samplers for shader model 1-3
      shaders.
      The vkd3d_shader_scan_thread_group_size_info structure
      extends the vkd3d_shader_compile_info structure, and can be
      used to to retrieve the thread group size expected by a
      compute shader. This information is particularly useful when
      targeting Metal environments, because the Metal API requires
      the thread group size to be specified through its dispatch
      API, instead of being specified by the shader.
      The VKD3D_SHADER_PARAMETER_NAME_BUMP_LUMINANCE_OFFSET_[0-5]
      shader parameters specify the corresponding bump-mapping
      luminance offsets.
      The VKD3D_SHADER_PARAMETER_NAME_BUMP_LUMINANCE_SCALE_[0-5]
      shader parameters specify the corresponding bump-mapping
      luminance scale factors.
      The VKD3D_SHADER_PARAMETER_NAME_BUMP_MATRIX_[0-5] shader
      parameters specify the corresponding bump-mapping
      transformation matrices.

Sun Aug 24 08:56:58 UTC 2025 - Marcus Meissner <meissner@suse.com>

- Update to version 1.17:
  - Initial HLSL support for thread group shared memory.
  - Several features have been implemented for the experimental Metal Shading Language target.
  - Miscellaneous bug fixes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun 12 02:18:29 UTC 2025 - Simon Vogl <simon.vogl@gmx.net>

- Update to version 1.16:
  - libvkd3d
    DXIL shaders are supported in the default configuration.
    Previously this required building vkd3d with the
    ‘-DVKD3D_SHADER_UNSUPPORTED_DXIL’ preprocessor option. The
    also raises the maximum supported shader model to version 6.0.
    Graphics pipeline state objects can be created from shaders
    with embedded root signatures. This was already possible for
    compute pipeline state objects.
    The SetEventOnMultipleFenceCompletion() method of the
    ID3D12Device1 interface is implemented.
    When the VK_KHR_zero_initialize_workgroup_memory extension is
    supported, libvkd3d supports zero-initialising compute shader
    thread group shared memory.
    The VK_KHR_maintenance2 extension is now explicitly required.
    libvkd3d already unconditionally used features provided by
    this extension, but unfortunately didn't explicitly require it.
    Support for this extension is widespread, and the extension is
    part of Vulkan 1.1.
  - libvkd3d-shader
    The previously experimental support for compiling DXIL shaders
    is now a supported feature and enabled by default. Please note
    that this feature is nevertheless still far from perfect.
    New features for the HLSL source type:
      Initial support for geometry shaders.
      Indirect addressing in shader model 1-3 target profiles.
      Modulus and truncation operations in shader model 1-3 target
      profiles.
      Vectorised output code.
      Further improved constant folding and propagation.
      The following intrinsic functions are supported:
        AllMemoryBarrier()
        AllMemoryBarrierWithGroupSync()
        DeviceMemoryBarrier()
        DeviceMemoryBarrierWithGroupSync()
        GroupMemoryBarrier()
        GroupMemoryBarrierWithGroupSync()
      The ‘.Length’ Texture object property.
      The ‘SV_RenderTargetArrayIndex’ and ‘SV_ViewportArrayIndex’
      semantics in tessellation shaders.
    Disassembler support for binary ‘fx_2_0’ effects.
    Experimental built-in support for disassembling SPIR-V
    shaders, enabled by building vkd3d with the
    ‘-DVKD3D_SHADER_UNSUPPORTED_SPIRV_PARSER’ preprocessor option.
    When enabled, the built-in SPIR-V disassembler is used instead
    of SPIRV-Tools for the ‘spirv-text’ target type, as well as
    for the debug output enabled by the VKD3D_SHADER_DEBUG
    environment variable.
    The experimental OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL) target
    supports indirect addressing of constant buffers.
    The experimental Metal Shading Language (MSL) target supports
    texture loads.
    New interfaces:
      The VKD3D_SHADER_COMPILE_OPTION_FEATURE_ZERO_INITIALIZE
      _WORKGROUP_MEMORY flag indicates support for
      zero-initialising workgroup memory in the SPIR-V target
      environment.
      The VKD3D_SHADER_COMPONENT_INT64 enumeration value indicates
      a 64-bit signed integer value.
      The VKD3D_SHADER_COMPONENT_FLOAT16 enumeration value
      indicates a 16-bit IEEE floating-point value.
      The VKD3D_SHADER_COMPONENT_UINT16 enumeration value
      indicates a 16-bit unsigned integer value.
      The VKD3D_SHADER_COMPONENT_INT16 enumeration value indicates
      a 16-bit signed integer value.
      When targeting VKD3D_SHADER_API_1_16, the
      VKD3D_SHADER_RESOURCE_DATA_NONE enumeration value is
      returned for the ‘resource_data_type’ field in the
      vkd3d_shader_descriptor_info structure for sampler
      descriptors. VKD3D_SHADER_API_1_15 and before use the
      VKD3D_SHADER_RESOURCE_DATA_UINT enumeration value for this.
  - demos
    The vkd3d demos now work on both the Microsoft Windows and
    Apple macOS builds. The macOS versions of the vkd3d demos are
    completely new in vkd3d 1.16, while the Windows demos could
    previously be built, but only worked on Wine. Note that the
    vkd3d demos produced by a Windows build of vkd3d are distinct
    from those produced by the ‘make crosstest’ target: the former
    are Vulkan applications using vkd3d, while the latter are
    Direct3D 12 applications.
    The vkd3d demos have basic support for DPI scaling.
  - build
    Perl and the ‘JSON’ Perl module have been added as build
    dependencies.
    These are used for the experimental built-in SPIR-V
    disassembler, as well as for the macOS versions of the vkd3d
    demos.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar  5 13:52:20 UTC 2025 - llyyr <llyyr@yukari.in>

- Update to version 1.15:
  - libvkd3d
    vkd3d_queue_signal_on_cpu() allows a Direct3D 12 fence to be
    signalled when all preceding work on a Direct3D 12 command queue
    has been submitted to the corresponding Vulkan queue.
  - libvkd3d-shader
    New features for the HLSL source type:
      ‘InputPatch’ and ‘OutputPatch’ tessellation shader objects.
      This was the main feature required by most tessellation shaders
      that was still missing, and tessellation shaders should be
      considered generally usable now.
      Unrolling of loops containing conditional jumps.
      Improved function overload resolution. Previously the compiler
      was unable to decide between multiple function overloads with
      the same number of parameters.
      The parser is able to continue parsing in a larger number of
      error cases. This allows more issues in the input to be
      reported during a single compilaton attempt.
      The following intrinsic functions are supported:
        GatherCmp()
        GatherCmpAlpha(), GatherCmpBlue(), GatherCmpGreen(), and
        GatherCmpRed()
        InterlockedAdd(), InterlockedAnd(),
        InterlockedCompareExchange(),
        InterlockedCompareStore(), InterlockedExchange(),
        InterlockedMax(),
        InterlockedMin(), InterlockedOr(), and InterlockedXor()
        isinf()
      Separate resource and sampler support for shader model 1-3
      target profiles.
      Casts on the left hand side of assignments.
      Reassociation and redistribution of constants in binary
      expressions, to facilitate constant folding.
      Packing of interstage I/O variables with the ‘SV_IsFrontFace’,
      ‘SV_PrimitiveID’, ‘SV_RenderTargetArrayIndex’,
      ‘SV_SampleIndex’, and ‘SV_ViewPortArrayIndex’ semantics
      matches d3dcompiler/fxc more closely.
      Parser support for the ‘LineStream’, ‘PointStream’,
      and ‘TriangleStream’ Stream-Output objects.
    A number of instructions have been implemented for the
    experimental MSL target. Although more and more shaders are
    starting to work, support is still fairly limited. For example,
    shader resource views and unordered access views are still
    entirely unsupported.
    Shader code generation for fixed-function fog. Like the existing
    shader code generation for other fixed-function features, this
    is mainly relevant for executing shader model 1-3 sources in
    modern target environments like Vulkan.
    The ‘fx’ parser can parse binary effects containing inline
    shader blobs.
    Internal validator support for validating I/O signatures, as
    well as I/O source and destination parameters. The validator is
    enabled by the ‘force_validation’ option, specified through the
    VKD3D_SHADER_CONFIG environment variable.
    Internal validator support for validating the number of indices
    used with a register, as well as basic bounds checking for
    static indices.
    New interfaces:
      The vkd3d_shader_scan_hull_shader_tessellation_info structure
      extends the vkd3d_shader_compile_info structure, and can be
      used to retrieve the output primitive type and partitioning
      mode used by a hull shader. This information is particularly
      useful for specifying
      vkd3d_shader_spirv_domain_shader_target_info structures when
      targetting SPIR-V in OpenGL environments.
      The VKD3D_SHADER_PARAMETER_NAME_FOG_FRAGMENT_MODE shader
      parameter specifies the kind of fog to generate in a fragment
      shader.
      The VKD3D_SHADER_PARAMETER_NAME_FOG_COLOUR shader parameter
      specifies the fog colour.
      The VKD3D_SHADER_PARAMETER_NAME_FOG_END shader parameter
      specifies the ‘end’ parameter used for linear fog generation.
      The VKD3D_SHADER_PARAMETER_NAME_FOG_SCALE shader parameter
      specifies the ‘scale’ parameter used for fog generation.
      The VKD3D_SHADER_PARAMETER_NAME_FOG_SOURCE shader parameter
      specifies the kind of fog coordinate to output from a
      pre-rasterisation shader.
  - vkd3d-compiler
    The new ‘dxbc-fx’ source type specifies an effect binary
    embedded in a DXBC container. This is a convenience feature;
    ‘vkd3d-compiler -x dxbc-fx blob.dxbc’ is equivalent to
    ‘vkd3d-dxbc -x t:FX10 blob.dxbc | vkd3d-compiler -x fx’.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Nov 23 20:34:19 UTC 2024 - Simon Vogl <simon.vogl@gmx.net>

- Update to version 1.14:
  - libvkd3d
    Depth bounds can be changed dynamically using the
    OMSetDepthBounds() method of the ID3D12GraphicsCommandList1
    interface.
    The new VKD3D_CAPS_OVERRIDE environment variable can be used
    to override the value of capabilities like the maximum feature
    level and resource binding tier reported to applications.
  - libvkd3d-shader
    Too long for changelog, for full changes, visit:
   https://gitlab.winehq.org/wine/vkd3d/-/blob/master/ChangeLog.md
  - libvkd3d-utils
    The GetDesc() method of the ID3D12ShaderReflection interface
    returned by D3DReflect() returns shader version information.
    New interfaces:
        D3DCompile2VKD3D() is a variant of D3DCompile2() that
        allows targeting the behaviour of a specific d3dcompiler
        version.
  - vkd3d-compiler
    The ‘--alias-double-as-float’ option specifies that the
    ‘double’ type behaves as an alias for the ‘float’ type in HLSL
    sources with shader model 1-3 target profiles.
    The ‘fx’ source type specifies binary Direct3D effects.
    The ‘msl’ target type specifies Metal Shading Language
    shaders.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct 31 00:48:49 UTC 2024 - Richard Rahl <rrahl0@opensuse.org>

- generate demo and docs, seperating them out into their own packages
- be more explicit with buildflags, enabling opengl
- write the spec file in more modern layout

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Sep 28 23:36:17 UTC 2024 - Simon Vogl <simon.vogl@gmx.net>

- Update to version 1.13:
  - libvkd3d
    The ID3D12CommandList6 interface is supported.
    Block-compressed textures can be created with unaligned
    dimensions.
    This corresponds to
    D3D12_FEATURE_D3D12_OPTIONS8.UnalignedBlockTexturesSupported.
    Some minor issues pointed out by the Vulkan validation layers
    have been addressed.
    These are not known to affect applications in practice, but
    should make libvkd3d slightly more well-behaved.
  - libvkd3d-shader
    New features for the HLSL source type:
    Basic loop unrolling support. Some of the more complicated
    cases like loops containing conditional jumps are still
    unsupported.
    Initialisation values for global variables, function
    parameters, and annotation variables are parsed and stored in
    output formats supporting them.
    Shader model 5.1 register spaces are supported when using the
    corresponding target profiles, as well as shader model 5.1
    reflection data.
    Register reservations support expressions as offsets. For
    example:
    ‘float f : register(c0[1 + 1 * 2]);’
    The tex1D(), tex2D(), tex3D(), and texCUBE() intrinsic
    function variants with explicit derivatives are supported.
    The following intrinsic functions are supported:
    asint()
    f16tof32()
    faceforward()
    GetRenderTargetSampleCount()
    rcp()
    tex2Dbias()
    tex1Dgrad(), tex2Dgrad(), tex3Dgrad(), and texCUBEgrad()
    The sin() and cos() intrinsic functions are supported in
    shader model 1-3 profiles.
    These were already supported in shader model 4+ profiles.
    The following features specific to effects target profiles:
    Types supported in version 4.0+:
    BlendState
    ComputeShader, DomainShader, GeometryShader, and HullShader
    DepthStencilState
    RasterizerState
    State application functions implemented for version 4.0+
    effects:
    OMSetRenderTargets()
    SetBlendState()
    SetComputeShader(), SetDomainShader(), SetGeometryShader(),
    SetHullShader(), SetPixelShader(), and SetVertexShader()
    SetDepthStencilState()
    SetRasterizerState()
    String types. These are mainly used for annotations.
    Annotations on global variables.
    Support for the ‘Texture’ field of the ‘SamplerState’ type.
    Support for NULL values.
    Stores to swizzled matrix variables.
    The ‘unsigned’ type modifier is supported. (For example,
    ‘unsigned int’.)
    Note that ‘uint’ and related types were already supported.
    ‘ConstantBuffer<>’ types.
    The ‘SV_Coverage’ output semantic for fragment shaders.
    The experimental DXIL source type supports quad group
    operations.
    The Direct3D shader model 2-3 ‘texldb’ instruction is
    correctly disassembled when outputting Direct3D shader
    assembly.
    New interfaces:
    The vkd3d_shader_parameter_info structure extends the
    vkd3d_shader_compile_info structure, and can be used to
    specify shader parameters.
    This is a more generic version of the shader parameter
    interface for SPIR-V targets in struct
    vkd3d_shader_spirv_target_info.
    The VKD3D_SHADER_PARAMETER_DATA_TYPE_FLOAT32 enumeration value
    specifies that a shader parameter contains 32-bit
    floating-point data.
    The VKD3D_SHADER_PARAMETER_NAME_ALPHA_TEST_FUNC shader
    parameter specifies the alpha test function.
    The VKD3D_SHADER_PARAMETER_NAME_ALPHA_TEST_REF shader
    parameter specifies the alpha test reference value.
    The VKD3D_SHADER_PARAMETER_NAME_FLAT_INTERPOLATION shader
    parameter specifies the interpolation mode for colour inputs
    in Direct3D shader model 1-3 fragment shaders.
    The VKD3D_SHADER_PARAMETER_TYPE_BUFFER enumeration value
    specifies that the value of a shader parameter is provided at
    run-time through a buffer resource.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar  7 17:11:06 UTC 2024 - Tobias Klausmann <tobias.klausmann@freenet.de>

- Update to version 1.11:
  - libvkd3d
    Descriptor updates happen asynchronously on an internal worker thread, for
    a minor performance improvement in applications that update many
    descriptors per frame.
    When the VK_EXT_mutable_descriptor_type extension is available, libvkd3d
    will make more efficient use of descriptor pools and sets.
    When the VK_EXT_shader_viewport_index_layer extension is available,
    libvkd3d supports indexing viewport and render target arrays from vertex
    and tessellation evaluation shaders.
    Support for standard (i.e., black and white) border colours is implemented.
    The GetResourceAllocationInfo1() method of the ID3D12Device4 interface is
    implemented.
    The ID3D12Device7 and ID3D12Resource2 interface is supported.
    Several new feature queries are supported: D3D12_FEATURE_D3D12_OPTIONS6,
    D3D12_FEATURE_D3D12_OPTIONS7, D3D12_FEATURE_D3D12_OPTIONS8,
    D3D12_FEATURE_D3D12_OPTIONS9, D3D12_FEATURE_D3D12_OPTIONS10,
    D3D12_FEATURE_D3D12_OPTIONS11, D3D12_FEATURE_D3D12_OPTIONS12 and
    D3D12_FEATURE_D3D12_OPTIONS13
  - libvkd3d-shader
    Initial support for compiling legacy Direct3D bytecode to SPIR-V.
    Experimental support for compiling DirectX Intermediate Language (DXIL) to
    SPIR-V and Direct3D shader assembly. Being an experimental feature, this
    requires building vkd3d with the ‘-DVKD3D_SHADER_UNSUPPORTED_DXIL’
    preprocessor option. Note that enabling this feature will affect the
    capabilities reported by libvkd3d as well, and may cause previously working
    applications to break due to attempting to use incomplete DXIL support. No
    API or ABI stability guarantees are provided for experimental features.
    New features for the HLSL source type:
    Initial support for the ‘fx_2_0’, ‘fx_4_0’, ‘fx_4_1’, and ‘fx_5_0’
    profiles, using the new ‘VKD3D_SHADER_TARGET_FX’ target type.
    Support for ‘Buffer’ resources.
    The acos(), asin(), atan(), and atan2() intrinsic functions are supported.
    Explicit register assignment using the ‘register()’ keyword in shader model
    1-3 profiles. This was previously only supported in shader model 4+
    profiles.
    Casts from integer to floating-point types in shader model 1-3 profiles.
    Support for various input/output semantics:
    SV_InstanceID in shader model 4+ fragment shaders.
    SV_PrimitiveID in shader model 4+ fragment shaders. In previous versions
    this was only supported in shader model 4+ geometry shaders.
    SV_RenderTargetArrayIndex in shader model 4+ vertex and fragment shaders.
    SV_ViewportArrayIndex in shader model 4+ vertex and fragment shaders.
    Support for various rasteriser-ordered view types. Specifically:
    RasterizerOrderedBuffer, RasterizerOrderedStructuredBuffer,
    RasterizerOrderedTexture1D, RasterizerOrderedTexture1DArray,
    RasterizerOrderedTexture2D, RasterizerOrderedTexture2DArray,
    RasterizerOrderedTexture3D
    New features for the SPIR-V target type:
    Support for globally coherent unordered access views. These have the
    ‘globallycoherent’ storage class in HLSL, and the ‘_glc’ suffix in Direct3D
    assembly.
    Support for thread group unordered access view barriers. This corresponds
    to ‘sync_ugroup’ instructions in Direct3D assembly.
    When the SPV_EXT_viewport_index_layer extension is supported, vertex and
    tessellation evaluation shaders can write render target and viewport array
    indices. This corresponds to the ‘SV_RenderTargetArrayIndex’ and
    ‘SV_ViewportArrayIndex’ HLSL output semantics.
    New interfaces:
    The VKD3D_SHADER_COMPILE_OPTION_FEATURE compile option can be used to
    specify features available in the target environment. The
    VKD3D_SHADER_COMPILE_OPTION_FEATURE_INT64 flag indicates support for 64-bit
    integer types in the SPIR-V target environment. The
    VKD3D_SHADER_COMPILE_OPTION_FEATURE_FLOAT64 flag indicates support for
    64-bit floating-point types in the SPIR-V target environment. For backward
    compatibility, VKD3D_SHADER_API_VERSION_1_10 and earlier also imply support
    for 64-bit floating-point types.
    The VKD3D_SHADER_SPIRV_EXTENSION_EXT_VIEWPORT_INDEX_LAYER enumeration value
    indicates support for the SPV_EXT_viewport_index_layer extension in the
    SPIR-V target environment.
  -libvkd3d-utils
    When available, the following Vulkan extensions are enabled by
    D3D12CreateDeviceVKD3D() and D3D12CreateDevice(): VK_KHR_android_surface,
    VK_KHR_wayland_surface, VK_KHR_win32_surface, VK_KHR_xlib_surface,
    VK_EXT_metal_surface, VK_MVK_ios_surface
    Previous versions of vkd3d-utils enabled VK_KHR_xcb_surface and
    VK_MVK_macos_surface. In practice this means that D3D12CreateDevice() /
    D3D12CreateDeviceVKD3D() can be used on the corresponding additional window
    systems.
    New interfaces:
    D3DReflect() is used to retrieve information about shaders. It currently
    supports retrieving information about input, output, and patch constant
    parameters using the ID3D12ShaderReflection interface.
    D3DDisassemble() is used to disassemble legacy Direct3D bytecode (shader
    model 1-3) and ‘Tokenized Program Format’ (shader model 4 and 5) shaders.

Thu Dec  7 13:07:01 UTC 2023 - Tobias Klausmann <tobias.klausmann@freenet.de>

- Update to version 1.10:
  - libvkd3d
    Creating pipeline state objects from pipeline state stream descriptions is
    implemented.
    Depth-bounds testing is implemented.
    When the VK_KHR_maintenance2 extension is available, libvkd3d will
    explicitly specify the usage flags of Vulkan image views. This is
    particularly useful on MoltenVK, where 2D-array views of 3D textures are
    subject to usage restrictions.
    The D3D12_FORMAT_SUPPORT2_UAV_TYPED_LOAD and/or
    D3D12_FORMAT_SUPPORT2_UAV_TYPED_STORE feature flags are reported for
    UAV formats when the ‘shaderStorageImageReadWithoutFormat’ and/or
    ‘shaderStorageImageWriteWithoutFormat’ Vulkan device features are supported.
    The ID3D12Device5 interface is supported.
    The ID3D12GraphicsCommandList5 interface is supported.
    The ID3D12Resource1 interface is supported.
  - libvkd3d-shader
    New features for the HLSL source type:
    Support for the following intrinsic functions: ceil(), degrees(), radians(),
    fwidth(), tan() tex2Dlod(), tex2Dproj(), texCUBEproj(), and tex3Dproj()
    Constant folding support for more expression types. In particular:
    ternary operators and branches, reciprocal square roots, exponentials,
    logical ‘not’ on booleans, bitwise complements, left/right shifts, ceil(),
    floor(), frac(), and saturate()
    Support for dynamic indexing of arrays.
    Support for ‘break’ and ‘continue’ statements.
    Support for ‘switch’ statements.
    The ‘linear’, ‘centroid’, and ‘noperspective’ interpolation modifiers are
    supported.
    The ‘RWTexture1DArray’ and ‘RWTexture2DArray’ unordered access view types
    are supported.
    ‘[loop]’ attributes are accepted on loops.
    u/U and l/L suffixes on integer constants.
    Floating-point values are explicitly clamped to the upper and lower bounds
    of the target type by ‘ftoi’ and ‘ftou’ instructions when targeting SPIR-V.
    Similarly, NaNs are flushed to zero. Some hardware/drivers would already do
    this implicitly, but behaviour for such inputs is undefined as far as
    SPIR-V is concerned.
    The VKD3D_SHADER_CONFIG environment variable can be used to modify the
    behaviour of libvkd3d-shader at run-time, analogous to the existing
    VKD3D_CONFIG environment variable for libvkd3d. See the README for a list
    of supported options.
    When scanning legacy Direct3D bytecode using vkd3d_shader_scan(),
    descriptor information for shader model 2 and 3 combined resource-sampler
    pairs is returned in the vkd3d_shader_scan_descriptor_info structure.
    Note that this information is not yet available for shader model 1 sources,
    although this will likely be added in a future release.
    The Direct3D shader assembly target supports the ‘rasteriser ordered view’
    flag (‘_rov’) on unordered access view declarations.
    New interfaces:
    The VKD3D_SHADER_COMPILE_OPTION_BACKWARD_COMPATIBILITY compile option can
    be used to specify backward compatibility options. The
    VKD3D_SHADER_COMPILE_OPTION_BACKCOMPAT_MAP_SEMANTIC_NAMES flag is the only
    currently supported flag, and can be used to specify that shader model 1-3
    semantic names should be mapped to their shader model 4+ system value
    equivalents when compiling HLSL sources.
    The VKD3D_SHADER_COMPILE_OPTION_FRAGMENT_COORDINATE_ORIGIN compile option
    can be used to specify the origin of fragment coordinates for SPIR-V
    targets. This is especially useful in OpenGL environments, where the origin
    may be different than in Direct3D or Vulkan environments.
    The vkd3d_shader_scan_combined_resource_sampler_info structure extends the
    vkd3d_shader_compile_info structure, and can be used to retrieve
    information about the combined resource-sampler pairs used by a shader.
    This is especially useful when compiling shaders for usage in environments
    without separate binding points for samplers and resources, like OpenGL.
    vkd3d_shader_free_scan_combined_resource_sampler_info() is used to free
    vkd3d_shader_scan_combined_resource_sampler_info structures.
  - libvkd3d-utils
    Passing the D3DCOMPILE_ENABLE_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY flag to D3DCompile()
    and D3DCompile2() will enable mapping shader model 1-3 semantic names to
    their shader model 4+ system value equivalents.
    New interfaces:
    D3DGetBlobPart() is used to retrieve specific parts of DXBC blobs.
    D3DGetDebugInfo() is used to retrieve debug information from DXBC blobs.
    D3DGetInputAndOutputSignatureBlob() is used to retrieve input and output
    signatures from DXBC blobs.
    D3DGetInputSignatureBlob() is used to retrieve input signatures from DXBC
    blobs.
    D3DGetOutputSignatureBlob() is used to retrieve output signatures from DXBC
    blobs.
    D3DStripShader() is used to remove specific parts from DXBC blobs.
  - vkd3d-compiler
    The ‘--fragment-coordinate-origin’ option can be used to specify the origin
    of fragment coordinates for SPIR-V targets.
    The ‘--semantic-compat-map’ option can be used to specify that shader model
    1-3 semantic names should be mapped to their shader model 4+ system value
    equivalents when compiling HLSL sources.
  - vkd3d-dxbc
    The ‘--list’ and ‘--list-data’ options now also output the offsets of
    sections inside the input data.
  - build
    The minimum required version of Vulkan-Headers for this release is version
    1.2.148.
    When available, the libEGL and libOpenGL libraries are used to run the
    vkd3d tests in additional configurations. These libraries are not used by
    vkd3d itself.
    The SONAME_LIBDXCOMPILER configure variable can be used specify the shared
    object name of the dxcompiler library. When available, it's used to run the
    vkd3d tests in additional configurations. The dxcompiler library is not
    used by vkd3d itself.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Sep 23 14:01:50 UTC 2023 - Tobias Klausmann <tobias.klausmann@freenet.de>

- Update to version 1.9:
  - libvkd3d
    Copying between depth/stencil and colour formats in
    ID3D12GraphicsCommandList::CopyResource() is supported.
    The ID3D12Fence1 interface is supported.
  - libvkd3d-shader
    vkd3d_shader_scan() supports retrieving descriptor information for d3dbc'
    shaders. This is one of the requirements for eventual SPIR-V generation
    from d3dbc' sources.
    New features for the HLSL source type:
    Support for the following intrinsic functions: clip(), ddx_coarse(),
    ddy_coarse(), ddx_fine(), ddy_fine(), tex1D(), tex2D(), texCUBE(), and
    tex3D()
    Constant folding support for more expression types. In particular:
    comparison operators, floating-point min(), max(), logical and' and or',
    dot products, square roots and logarithms
    Support for multi-sample texture object declarations without explicit
    sample counts in shader model 4.1 and later shaders.
    Support for using constant expressions as sample counts in multi-sample
    texture object declarations.
    Support for variable initialisers using variables declared earlier in the
    same declaration list. E.g., `float a = 1, b = a, c = b + 1;'.
    The GetDimensions() texture object method is implemented.
    Matrix swizzles are implemented.
    Parser support for if-statement attributes like [branch]' and [flatten]'.
    Support for the `inline' function modifier.
    Previously, vkd3d_shader_compile() would in some cases return VKD3D_OK
    despite compilation failing when targeting legacy Direct3D bytecode. These
    cases have been fixed.
    Various HLSL preprocessor fixes for edge cases related to stringification.
    SPIR-V target support for the `linear noperspective centroid' input
    interpolation mode.
    New interfaces:
    The vkd3d_shader_scan_signature_info structure extends the
    vkd3d_shader_compile_info structure, and can be used to retrieve
    descriptions of dxbc-tpf' and d3dbc' shader inputs and outputs.
    vkd3d_shader_free_scan_signature_info() is used to free
    vkd3d_shader_scan_signature_info structures.
    The VKD3D_SHADER_COMPILE_OPTION_PACK_MATRIX_ORDER compile option can be
    used to specify the default matrix packing order for HLSL sources.
    The vkd3d_shader_varying_map_info structure extends the
    vkd3d_shader_compile_info structure, and can be used to specify a mapping
    between the outputs of a shader stage and the inputs of the next shader
    stage.
    vkd3d_shader_build_varying_map() is used to build a mapping between the
    outputs of a shader stage and the inputs of the next shader stage.
    The VKD3D_SHADER_DESCRIPTOR_INFO_FLAG_RAW_BUFFER flag returned as part of
    the vkd3d_shader_descriptor_info structure indicates the descriptor refers
    to a byte-addressed (`raw') buffer resource.
  - vkd3d-compiler
    The `--matrix-storage-order' option can used to specify the default matrix
    storage order for HLSL sources.
  - vkd3d-dxbc
    vkd3d-dxbc is a new utility that can be used to inspect the contents of DXBC
    blobs.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Aug  6 14:53:19 UTC 2023 - Tobias Klausmann <tobias.klausmann@freenet.de>

- Update to version 1.8:
  - Performance improvements have been made to the code that handles descriptor
    updates. In some applications the improvement can be quite significant.
  - Host-visible descriptor heaps are persistently mapped on creation. Some
    applications access resource data from the CPU after calling Unmap(), and
    that's supposed to work in practice.
  - 1-dimensional texture unordered-access views and shader resource views are
    implemented.
  - Shader resource view, unordered access view, and constant buffer view root
    descriptors with NULL GPU addresses are supported.
  - Direct3D 12 descriptor heap destruction is delayed until all contained
    resources are destroyed.
  - libvkd3d-shader
    - New features for the HLSL source type:
      - Support for the ternary conditional operator "?:".
      - Support for "discard" statements.
      - Support for the "packoffset" keyword.
      - Support for semantics on array types.
      - Support for RWBuffer loads and stores.
      - Register allocation for arrays and structures of resources and samplers
        is implemented.
      - Support for the SV_IsFrontFace pixel shader system-value semantics.
      - Support for using constant expressions as array sizes and indices.
      - Support for dynamic selection of vector components.
      - Support for the following intrinsic functions: D3DCOLORtoUBYTE4(),
        any(), asfloat(), ddx(), ddy(), fmod(), log(), log2(), log10(), sign()
        and trunc().
      - The SampleBias(), SampleCmp(), SampleCmpLevelZero(), and SampleGrad()
        texture object methods are implemented.
      - Support for the case-insensitive variants of the "vector" and "matrix"
        data types.
      - Parser support for the "unroll" loop attribute. A warning is output for
        "unroll" without iteration count, and an error is output when an
        iteration count is specified. Actual unrolling is not implemented yet.
      - Parser support for RWStructuredBuffer resources.
      - Parser support for SamplerComparisonState objects. Note that outputting
        compiled effects is not supported yet, but parsing these allows shaders
        containing SamplerComparisonState state objects to be compiled.
    - More improvements to HLSL support for the Direct3D shader model 1/2/3
      profiles.
    - The section alignment of DXBC blobs produced by
      vkd3d_shader_serialize_dxbc() matches those produced by d3dcompiler more
      closely.
    - The "main" function for shaders produced by the SPIR-V target is always
      terminated, even when the source was a TPF shader without explicit "ret"
      instruction.
    - Relative addressing of shader input registers is supported by SPIR-V
     targets.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 17 17:06:32 UTC 2023 - Tobias Klausmann <tobias.klausmann@freenet.de>

- Update to version 1.7.1:
  - Release 1.7 has a bug that causes an internal mutex in its command queue
    implementation to be unlocked too early under certain usage patterns. This
    is known to further cause internal inconsistencies that manifest as program
    deadlocks for some programs. In release 1.7.1 the mutex is correctly kept
    locked until required.
  - Symbol D3D12CreateDevice is mistakenly not exported in release 1.7,
    breaking library clients that need it. The symbol is exported again in
    release 1.7.1.
