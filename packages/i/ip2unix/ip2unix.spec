%description
Executes a program and converts IP to Unix domain sockets at runtime based on a
list of rules, either given via short command line options or via a file with a
list of rules. The first matching rule causes ip2unix to replace the current IP
socket with a Unix domain socket based on the options given. For example if a
socketPath is specified, the Unix domain socket will bind or listen to the given
path.
