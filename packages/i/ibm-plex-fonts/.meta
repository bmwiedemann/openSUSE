  <description>IBM wanted Plex to be a distinctive, yet timeless workhorse — an alternative to
its previous corporate font family, “Helvetica Neue”, for this new era. The
Grotesque style was the perfect fit. Not only do Grotesque font families
balance human and rational elements, the Grotesque style also came about during
the Industrial Age, when IBM was born.</description>
