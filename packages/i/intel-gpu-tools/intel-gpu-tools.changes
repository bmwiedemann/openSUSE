Update to version 1.15
- New KMS test: tests/kms_cursor_legacy (Stress legacy cursor ioctl)
(Chris Wilson)
- Several GEM tests have been removed from BAT: tests/gem_exec_whisper,
tests/gem_sync (dropped individual engines), test/gem_cs_prefetch (replaced
by test/gem_exec_gttfill), tests/gem_ctx_param_basic (got relabeled
to tests/gem_ctx_param) (Chris Wilson)
- build: Skip configure step if is NOCONFIGURE set (Tomeu Vizoso)
- tools/intel_bios_reader: Added options for dumping individual panels, specific
section, hex format and other various fixes (Jani Nikula)
- build: Add optional --enable-werror
(hard-fail in case of compiler warnings) (Marius Vlad)
- New KMS test: tests/prime_mmap_kms (show case dma-buf new API
and processes restrictions) (Tiago Vignatti)
- Several tests have gained to ability to be run on different platforms
than Intel: tests/testdisplay (Tomeu Vizoso), tests/kms_panel_fitting
(Robert Foss), tests/kms_flip_event_leak, tests/kms_flip (Tomeu Vizoso).
- compute exitcode first: In the case of running multiple subtests which all
happen to be skipped, igt_exitcode is 0, but the final exit code will be 77.
(Chris Wilson)
- Shorten tests/kms_flip test (Tvrtko Ursulin)
- Half the timeout for suspend to RAM and a third for suspend to disk
(Marius Vlad)
- lib: Pass format instead of bpp to create_bo_for_fb (Ville Syrjälä)

tests/test-list-full.txt that contains all the tests. This will speed
up considerably piglit when starting tests. (Gabriel Feceoru)
- piglit changed its behaviour to prevent overwriting the results. A fairly new
version of piglit is required to run i-g-t tests. (Gabriel Feceoru)
- lib: Replace drmIoctl() with a layer of indirection (Chris Wilson)
- Adding missing Broxton PCI IDs (Rodrigo Vivi)
- Added COMMIT_ATOMIC (lib/igt_kms, w/ tests/kms_rotation_crc).
Requires nuclear_pageflip parameter turned on in the i915 driver.
(Mayuresh Gharpure, Pratik Vishwakarma)

tests/gem_exec_reloc (Chris Wilson)
- New GEM tests: tests/gem_exec_whisper, tests/gem_exec_store,
test/gem_exec_gttfill, tests/gem_exec_suspend, tests/gem_exec_flush
(Chris Wilson)
- New benchmarks: benchmarks/gem_syslatency, benchmarks/gem_exec_fault

- tests/pm_rpm: Fix crash on machines that lack LLC (David Weinehall)
- lib/igt_fb: Fix domain tracking for GTT cairo surfaces (Chris Wilson)

via rst2man.
