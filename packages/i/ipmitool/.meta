  <title>Utility for IPMI Control</title>
  <description>This package contains a utility for interfacing with devices that
support the Intelligent Platform Management Interface specification. 
IPMI is an open standard for machine health, inventory, and remote
power control.

This utility can communicate with IPMI-enabled devices through either a
kernel driver such as OpenIPMI or over the RMCP LAN protocol defined in
the IPMI specification.  IPMIv2 adds support for encrypted LAN
communications and remote Serial-over-LAN functionality.

It provides commands for reading the Sensor Data Repository (SDR) and
displaying sensor values, displaying the contents of the System Event
Log (SEL), printing Field Replaceable Unit (FRU) information, reading
and setting LAN configuration, and chassis power control.</description>
