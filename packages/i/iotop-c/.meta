  <description>iotop-c does for I/O usage what top(1) does for CPU usage. It watches I/O usage
information output by the Linux kernel and displays a table of current I/O usage
by processes on the system. It is handy for answering the question &quot;Why is the
disk churning so much?&quot;.

iotop-c requires a Linux kernel built with the CONFIG_TASKSTATS, CONFIG_TASK_DELAY_ACCT, CONFIG_TASK_IO_ACCOUNTING and CONFIG_VM_EVENT_COUNTERS config options on.

iotop-c is an alternative re-implementation of iotop in C, optimized for
performance. Normally a monitoring tool intended to be used on a system under
heavy stress should use the least additional resources as possible.</description>
