  <description>Iperf here is a means of measuring networks - capacity &amp; latency (including dual queue L4S) over sockets both TCP and UDP. The goals include maintaining an active iperf code base across a broad set of platforms and operating systems. This is a multi-threaded design that scales with the number of CPUs or cores within a system. It supports both high impact and low impact techniques to obtain and report network performance.
