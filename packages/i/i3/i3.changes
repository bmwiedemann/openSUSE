- Remove suse specific path from build folder to ease building
  for other non-SUSE, rpm based linux distributions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Sep 24 23:38:09 UTC 2017 - aavindraa@gmail.com

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep  4 16:38:18 UTC 2017 - aavindraa@gmail.com

- update to 4.14
- Remove U_configure_ac.patch (was accepted upstream)
* Aside from many bug and documentation fixes, the “swap” command is a notable
	addition of this release. As is almost tradition at this point, keybinding
	handling has seen some fixes as well. A noticeable change for users with such
	monitors is i3’s support for RandR 1.5, which transparently supports the TILE
	property of first-gen 4K monitors and current 5K or 8K monitors.

    strtol(), not only base 10
  * non-true color displays are now supported again (e.g. the
    Raspberry Pi)
  * the “split” command now has a “toggle” option

    added
  * using pango markup in mode names is now optional, fixing a
    regression in i3
  * v4.11 where modes which contained characters such as “<” would
    break.
  * moving windows to a workspace by specifying a mark now works

    x2go)
  * assignments are now marked as run before executing them,
    preventing endless
  * loops/crashes when assignments cause another assignment evaluation
  * splitting/floating a dock container no longer crashes i3
  * correctly compare modifier mask when identifying keybindings
    (fixes
  * bindings which use --release)
  * no longer fail config validation when there is no newline at the
    end of
  * the config file
  * scrollwheel buttons are now only grabbed when necessary, allowing
    the use
  * of “bindsym button*” or scrolling in windows without focusing them
    (in case
  * no “bindsym button*” is present)
  * parse con_id in base 16 (affected FreeBSD only)

    invoked
  * on workspace containers
  * actually accept the documented “workspace” token as an alternative
    to “→”
  * in assign statements
  * remove _NET_WM_STATE on withdrawn windows to comply with the spec

    output
