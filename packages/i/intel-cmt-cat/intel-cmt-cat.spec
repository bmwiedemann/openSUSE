%description
This software package provides basic support for
Cache Monitoring Technology (CMT), Memory Bandwidth Monitoring (MBM),
Cache Allocation Technology (CAT) and Code Data Prioratization (CDP).

CMT, MBM and CAT are configured using Model Specific Registers (MSRs)
to measure last level cache occupancy, set up the class of service masks and
manage the association of the cores/logical threads to a class of service.
The software executes in user space, and access to the MSRs is
obtained through a standard Linux* interface. The virtual file system
provides an interface to read and write the MSR registers but
it requires root privileges.
