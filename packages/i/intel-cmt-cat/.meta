  <title>Monitor LLC occupancy (CMT) and memory bandwidth (MBM)
  </title>
  <description>
This software package provides basic support for
Intel(R) Resource Director Technology (Intel(R) RDT) including:
Cache Monitoring Technology (CMT), Memory Bandwidth Monitoring (MBM),
Cache Allocation Technology (CAT) and Code and Data Prioritization (CDP).

In principle, the software programs the technologies via
Model Specific Registers (MSR) on a per core or hardware thread basis.
MSR access is arranged via standard operating system driver: msr on Linux and
cpuctl on FreeBSD. Presence of the technologies is detected via CPUID
instruction. In some cases CAT is detected via brand string read from CPUID.

Software detects presence of Linux perf extensions for
the monitoring technologies. In such case it enables library API's for
monitoring processes.
