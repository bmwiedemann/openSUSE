- Update to version 1.2.1 (included changes of unreleased v1.2)
	version 1.2 new features:
	* Generate EVM signatures based on the specified hash algorithm
	* include "security.apparmor" in EVM signature
	* Add support for writing & verifying "user.xxxx" xattrs for testing
	* Support Strebog/Gost hash functions
	* Add OpenSSL engine support
	* Use of EVP_PKEY OpenSSL API to generate/verify v2 signatures
	* Support verifying multiple signatures at once
	* Support new template "buf" field and warn about other unknown fields
	* Improve OpenSSL error reporting
	* Support reading TPM 2.0 PCRs using tsspcrread

	Bug fixes and code cleanup:
	* Update manpage stylesheet detection
	* Fix xattr.h include file
	* On error when reading TPM PCRs, don't log gargabe
	* Properly return keyid string to calc_keyid_v1/v2 callers, caused by
	  limiting keyid output to verbose mode
	* Fix hash buffer overflow caused by EVM support for larger hashes,
	  defined MAX_DIGEST_SIZE and MAX_SIGNATURE_SIZE, and added "asserts".
	* Linked with libcrypto instead of OpenSSL
	* Updated Autotools, replacing INCLUDES with AM_CPPFLAGS
	* Include new "hash-info.gen" in tar
	* Log the hash algorithm, not just the hash value
	* Fixed memory leaks in: EV_MD_CTX, init_public_keys
	* Fixed other warnings/bugs discovered by clang, coverity
	* Remove indirect calls in verify_hash() to improve code readability
	* Don't fallback to using sha1
	* Namespace some too generic object names
	* Make functions/arrays static if possible

- Upstream bumped soname to 1.0.0 in v1.2
- Drop ima-evm-utils-xattr.patch and ima-evm-utils-fix-docbook-xsl-directory.patch (included in v1.2)

Fri Mar 16 09:23:01 UTC 2018 - pvorel@suse.cz

- Update to version 1.1
  * Support the new openssl 1.1 api
  * Support for validating multiple pcrs
  * Verify the measurement list signature based on the list digest
  * Verify the "ima-sig" measurement list using multiple keys
  * Fixed parsing the measurement template data field length

  * Multiple fixes that have been lingering in the next branch. Some
    are for experimental features that are not yet supported in the
    kernel.
- Drop ima-evm-utils-openssl1.patch (not needed any more as IMA got
  backward compatible support for openssl 1.1).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov 21 08:42:47 UTC 2017 - mpluskal@suse.com

  "current" version of stylesheet to make the build work again
- adjusted spec file to apply stylesheet patch to SLE12 as well

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May  8 12:48:44 UTC 2017 - meissner@suse.com

- Add ima-evm-utils to SLES. (FATE#321603)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan 19 09:32:33 UTC 2016 - meissner@suse.com

  fixed the nwalsh docbook directory again

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec  2 13:44:58 UTC 2015 - p.drouand@gmail.com

- Update to version 1.0
  * Recursive hashing
  * Immutable EVM signatures (experimental)
  * Command 'ima_clear' to remove xattrs
  * Support for passing password to the library
  * Support for asking password safely from the user

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan 21 17:39:08 UTC 2015 - p.drouand@gmail.com

- Update to version 0.9
  * Updated README
  * man page generated and added to the package
  * Use additional SMACK xattrs for EVM signature generation
  * Signing functions moved to libimaevm for external use (RPM)
  * Fixed setting of correct hash header
- Add additional requirements; asciidoc, docbook-xsl-stylesheets,
  libattr-devel and libxslt-tools
- Remove COPYING from sources; upstream provides one now
- Remove automake.patch; "test" directory isn't provided by upstream
  anymore
- Remove ima-evm-utils-xattr.patch; libimaevm0 does link against
  libattr now
- Split package in three subpackage
  * libimaevm0: contains shared library
  * -devel: contains header and examples files
  * evmctl: the kernel signing tool
- Add ima-evm-utils-fix-docbook-xsl-directory.patch; fix path
  where Make is looking for docbook.xsl

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Oct 12 15:03:26 UTC 2014 - crrodriguez@opensuse.org

- ima-evm-utils-xattr.patch: libattr is never linked, things
 still work because glibc provides the same interface, switch
 the includes to the glibc headers and remove the build dependency.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug 13 08:52:35 UTC 2013 - meissner@suse.com

- Initial packaging of IMA EVM tool.
- automake.patch: fix for newer automake
- supply COPYING for LGPL-2.1+, as package only has an empty one.
