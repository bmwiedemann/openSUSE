Wed Jul 22 08:23:08 UTC 2020 - Petr Vorel <pvorel@suse.cz>

- Update to version 1.3
	version 1.3 new features:
	* NEW ima-evm-utils regression test infrastructure with two initial
	  tests:
	  - ima_hash.test: calculate/verify different crypto hash algorithms
	  - sign_verify.test: EVM and IMA sign/verify signature tests
	* TPM 2.0 support
	  - Calculate the new per TPM 2.0 bank template data digest
	  - Support original padding the SHA1 template data digest
	  - Compare ALL the re-calculated TPM 2.0 bank PCRs against the
	    TPM 2.0 bank PCR values
	  - Calculate the per TPM bank "boot_aggregate" values, including
	    PCRs 8 & 9 in calculation
	  - Support reading the per TPM 2.0 Bank PCRs using Intel's TSS
	  - boot_aggregate.test: compare the calculated "boot_aggregate"
	    values with the "boot_aggregate" value included in the IMA
	    measurement.
	* TPM 1.2 support
	  - Additionally support reading the TPM 1.2 PCRs from a supplied file
	    ("--pcrs" option)
	* Based on original IMA LTP and standalone version support
	  - Calculate the TPM 1.2 "boot_aggregate" based on the exported
	    TPM 1.2 BIOS event log.
	  - In addition to verifying the IMA measurement list against the
	    the TPM PCRs, verify the IMA template data digest against the
	    template data.  (Based on LTP "--verify" option.)
	  - Ignore file measurement violations while verifying the IMA
	    measurment list. (Based on LTP "--validate" option.)
	  - Verify the file data signature included in the measurement list
	    based on the file hash also included in the measurement list
	    (--verify-sig)
	  - Support original "ima" template (mixed templates not supported)
	* Support "sm3" crypto name

	Bug fixes and code cleanup:
	* Don't exit with -1 on failure, exit with 125
	* On signature verification failure, include pathname.
	* Provide minimal hash_info.h file in case one doesn't exist, needed
	  by the ima-evm-utils regression tests.
	* On systems with TPM 1.2, skip "boot_aggregate.test" using sample logs
	* Fix hash_algo type comparison mismatch
	* Simplify/clean up code
	* Address compiler complaints and failures
	* Fix memory allocations and leaks
	* Sanity check provided input files are regular files
	* Revert making "tsspcrread" a compile build time decision.
	* Limit additional messages based on log level (-v)

- Add patch 0001-pcr_tss-Fix-compilation-for-old-compilers.patch
- Upstream bumped soname to 2.0.0
- Add tpm2-0-tss-devel for Tumbleweed as build dependency, for the rest ibmtss
  as runtime dependency (needed for for reading PCR in ima_boot_aggregate cmd;
  better to use libtss2-esys and libtss2-rc than require tsspcrread binary in
  runtime, but tpm2-0-tss-devel is available only for Tumbleweed) + the same
  logic as runtime dependency for devel package
- Mark COPYING as %license

	* Fix xattr.h include file
	* On error when reading TPM PCRs, don't log gargabe
	* Properly return keyid string to calc_keyid_v1/v2 callers, caused by
	  limiting keyid output to verbose mode
	* Fix hash buffer overflow caused by EVM support for larger hashes,
	  defined MAX_DIGEST_SIZE and MAX_SIGNATURE_SIZE, and added "asserts".
	* Linked with libcrypto instead of OpenSSL
	* Updated Autotools, replacing INCLUDES with AM_CPPFLAGS
