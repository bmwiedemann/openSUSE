%description
Iperf is a tool for active measurements of the maximum achievable bandwidth
on IP networks. It supports tuning of various parameters related to timing,
protocols, and buffers. For each test it reports the bandwidth, loss, and
other parameters.

This version, sometimes referred to as iperf3, is a redesign of an original
version developed at NLANR/DAST. iperf3 is a new implementation from scratch,
with the goal of a smaller, simpler code base, and a library version of the
functionality that can be used in other programs. iperf3 also a number of
features found in other tools such as nuttcp and netperf, but were missing
from the original iperf. These include, for example, a zero-copy mode and
optional JSON output.

Note that iperf3 is NOT backwards compatible with the original iperf.

%description -n lib%{name}%{soname}
lib%{name} gives you access to all the functionality of the iperf3
network testing tool.
You can build it directly into your own program, instead of having
to run it as a shell command.
