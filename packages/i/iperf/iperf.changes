Mon Sep 14 10:48:05 UTC 2020 - Dirk Mueller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 3.9:
  * A --timestamps flag has been added, which prepends a timestamp to
    each output line.  An optional argument to this flag, which is a
    format specification to strftime(3), allows for custom timestamp
    formats (#909, #1028).
  * A --server-bitrate-limit flag has been added as a server-side
    command-line argument.  It allows a server to enforce a maximum
    throughput rate; client connections that specify a higher bitrate
    or exceed this bitrate during a test will be terminated.  The
    bitrate is expressed in bits per second, with an optional trailing
    slash and integer count that specifies an averaging interval over
    which to enforce the limit (#999).
  * A bug that caused increased CPU usage with the --bidir option has
    been fixed (#1011).
  * Fixed various minor memory leaks (#1023).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jul 11 09:45:53 UTC 2020 - Michal Svec <msvec@suse.com>

  (removed iperf-disable-profiling.patch)
  
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov 14 21:32:57 UTC 2019 - Michal Svec <msvec@suse.com>

- update to 3.7
  * Support for simultaneous bidirectional tests with the --bidir flag
  * Use POSIX standard clock_gettime(3) interface for timekeeping where
    available
  * Passwords for authentication can be provided via environment
    variable
  * Specifying --repeating-payload and --reverse now works
  * Failed authentication doesn't count for --one-off
  * Several memory leaks related to authenticated use were fixed
  * The delay for tearing down the control connection for the default
    timed tests has been increased, to more gracefully handle
    high-delay paths
  * Various improvements to the libiperf APIs
  * Fixed build behavior when OpenSSL is absent
  * Portability fixes
- spec file cleanup

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul  6 07:22:31 UTC 2018 - liedke@rz.uni-mannheim.de

- update to 3.6
  * A new --extra-data option can be used to fill in a user-defined
    string field that appears in JSON output.
  * A new --repeating-payload option makes iperf3 use a payload pattern
    similar to that used by iperf2, which could help in recreating
    results that might be affected by payload entropy (for example,
    compression).
  * -B now works properly with SCTP tests.
  * A compile fix for Solaris 10 was added.
  * Some minor bug fixes for JSON output.  In particular, warnings for
    debug and/or verbose modes with --json output and a fix for
    JSON output on CentOS 6

- update to version 3.1.1
  * Minor bugfixes

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov 30 21:11:15 UTC 2015 - p.drouand@gmail.com

- Update to version 3.1
  * SCTP support has been added (with the --sctp flag), on Linux,
    FreeBSD, and Solaris (issue #131).
  * Setting CPU affinity now works on FreeBSD.
  * Selection of TCP congestion now works on FreeBSD, and is now
    called --congestion (the old --linux-congestion option works
    but is now deprecated).
  * A new -I option for the server causes it to write a PID file,
    mostly useful for daemon mode (issue #120).
  * A --logfile argument can now force all output to go to a file,
    rather than to a file.  This is especially useful when running an
    iperf3 server in daemon mode (issue #119).
  * Various compatibility fixes for Android (issue #184, issue #185),
    iOS (issue #288), NetBSD (issue #248), Solaris (issue #175, issue
    #178, issue #180, issue #211), vxWorks (issue #268).
  * A --udp-counters-64bit flag has been added to support very
    long-running UDP tests, which could cause a counter to overflow
    (issue #191).
  * A --cport option to specify the client-side port has been added
    (issue #207, issue #209, issue #239).
  * Some calculation errors with the -O feature have been fixed (issue
    #236).
  * A potential crash in the iperf3 server has been fixed (issue #257,
    issue #258).
  * Many miscellaneous bug fixes.
  * Consumers of libiperf can now get the JSON output for a
    just-completed test (issue #147).
  * Detection of various optional features has been improved to check
    for the presence or absence of platform functionality, not the name
    of platforms.
  * Out-of-tree builds now work (issue #265).

Tue Mar 25 11:24:38 UTC 2014 - aj@ajaissle.de

- iperf project moved from SourceForge to Google Code and now to GitHub.
  License changed from NCSA to BDS-3-Clause

- Update to 3.0.2
This version, sometimes referred to as iperf3, is a redesign of an original
version developed at NLANR/DAST. iperf3 is a new implementation from scratch, 
with the goal of a smaller, simpler code base, and a library version of the 
functionality that can be used in other programs. iperf3 also a number of 
features found in other tools such as nuttcp and netperf, but were missing 
from the original iperf. These include, for example, a zero-copy mode and 
optional JSON output.

Note that iperf3 is NOT backwards compatible with the original iperf.

- Added iperf-3.0.2_strncat_bufferoverflow.patch:
  * Prevent buffer overflow in strncat

- Added iperf-3.0.2_disable-profiling.patch:
  * Disable profiling on x86 (option '-pg' is incompatible with invoked
    option '-fomit-frame-pointer')

- Changes in 3.0.2
  * iperf3 now builds on Linux systems that do not support
    TCP_CONGESTION.  Most notably this allows iperf3 to work on CentOS
    5.
  * An abort on MacOS 10.9 has been fixed (issue #135).
  * Added -I flag for the server to write a PID file, mostly useful for
    daemon mode (issue #120).
  * A bug that could break some TCP tests on FreeBSD has been fixed.
  * TCP snd_cwnd output is now printed by default on Linux (issue #99).
  * In JSON output, the --title string no longer has a colon and two
    spaces appended (issue #139).
  * A buffer for holding formatted numeric values is now
    properly-sized so that output is not truncated (issue #142).
  * Some memory leaks have been fixed.
  * A -d flag enables debugging output.
  * libtoolize is now invoked correctly from the bootstrap.sh script.
  * The test unit format can now be set from the API (issue #144).
  * libiperf is now built as both shared and static libraries.

- Changes in 3.0.1
  * Added the following new flags
     -D, --daemon	       run server as a daemon
     -L, --flowlabel           set IPv6 flow label (Linux only)
     -C, --linux-congestion    set congestion control algorithm (Linux only)
     -k, --blockcount #[KMG]   number of blocks (packets) to transmit
     	 	      	       (instead of -t or -n)
  * Bug fixes

- Changes in 3.0-RC5
  * Added the following new flags
     -F, --file name           xmit/recv the specified file
     -A, --affinity n/n,m      set CPU affinity (Linux only)
     -J, --json                output in JSON format
     -Z, --zerocopy            use a 'zero copy' method of sending data
     -O, --omit N              omit the first n seconds
     -T, --title str           prefix every output line with this string
  * more useful information in 'verbose' mode
  * Many bug fixes

- Changes in 3.0b4

  * Added support for IPv6 mode (-6)
  * Setting TCP window size (-w) is now supported
  * Updates to iperf_error
      * Added new errors
      * Should generate more relavent messages
  * Stream list now managed by queue.h macros
  * Test structures are now kept intact after a test is run (for API users)
  * Improved interval timer granularity
      * Support for decimal values
  * Many bug fixes

- Changes in 3.0b3
  * Better error handling
      * All errors now handled with iperf_error()
      * All functions that can return errors return NULL or -1 on error and set i_errno appropriately
  * Iperf API intruduced
      * Support for adding new protocols
      * Added support for callback functions
          * on_connect - executes after a connection is made to the server
          * on_new_stream - executes after a new stream is created
          * on_test_start - executes right before the test begins
          * on_test_finish - executes after the test is finished

      * Support for setting bandwidth (-b)
      * Parallel UDP stream support
      * Reverse mode UDP support
  * Support for setting TCP_NODELAY (-N), disabling Nagle's Algorithm

      * Note: This feature is still in development. It is still very buggy.

- Changes in 3.0b1
  * TCP control socket now manages messages between client and server
  * Dynamic server (gets test parameters from client)
      * Server can now set test options dynamically without having to restart.
          * Currently supported options: -l, -t, -n, -P, -R

  * Results exchange
      * Client can now see server results (and vice versa)
  * Reverse mode (-R)
      * Server sends, client receives
