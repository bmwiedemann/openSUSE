%description
An implementation of the TCG TPM 2.0 specification. It is based on
the TPM specification Parts 3 and 4 source code donated by Microsoft,
with additional files to complete the implementation.

This TPM emulator listens on TCP ports (default 2321 and 2322) and
saves state to the file "NVChip" in the current directory.

It is probably not of much use other than testing the IBM TSS
implementation because of this specific interface.
