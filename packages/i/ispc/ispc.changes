Note, we don't do any GPU builds yet, because
 - API is not stable
 - additional dependencies (that are not available, yet)

- Update to version v1.14.1:
  A minor ISPC update with a bug fix for AVX512 detection problem on macOS
  (for more details see issue #1854) and update of GPU version to use Level0 v1.0.
  CPU binaries are based on patched LLVM 10.0.1.

- Update to version v1.14.0:
  An ISPC release with several improvements for CPU and initial support of Intel
  graphics hardware architectures. The binaries in this release include CPU versions
  for Windows, Linux, and macOS, as previous releases, plus a GPU-enabled Linux binary,
  which supports both CPU and GPU. CPU binaries are based on patched LLVM 10.0.1.

  CPU changes include:
  + new avx2-i8x32, avx2-i16x16, avx512skx-i8x64, avx512skx-i16x32 targets.
    "generic" targets were removed.
  + several stability fixes, including bugs discovered during fuzzing ISPC by YARPGen.
  + integer division performance improvements.
  + support for __vectorcall calling convention on Windows x64 (enabled by
    '--vectorcall')
