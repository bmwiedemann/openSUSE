Changes for openSUSE / SLE:

* ignition-mount-initrd-fstab.service / ignition-suse-generator:
  By default Ignition will only mount partitions or subvolumes explicitly
  mentioned in the Ignition configuration. On SUSE, however, the system
  is split over several subvolumes, and most users won't want to define
  all the partitions again. A lot of core functionality however (e.g.
  configuring a SSH certificate for the root user or adding a configuration
  file) requires access to those subvolumes.
  For better usability in addition to Ignition's own mount / umount stage all
  files systems tagged for being mounted in the initrd ("x-initrd.mount mount
  flag) will automatically be mounted / umounted.
* ignition-setup-user-suse.sh / ignition-userconfig-timeout*.conf:
  The user configuration can be stored on a device with the label "ignition"
  (e.g. by attaching a USB flash drive with that name) instead of putting the
  file onto the root partition.
* 02_ignition_firstboot:
  This file has been part of upstream ignition-dracut, but has since then been
  moved to a static CoreOS specific configuration
  (https://github.com/coreos/coreos-assembler/pull/616); it is now used in a
  modified version adapted to SUSE's needs.
  This script will automatically set the kernel parameters to trigger an
  Ignition run if a flag file is set (e.g. on first boot). To trigger an
  Ignition run manually just create the file
  "/boot/writable/ignition.firstboot".
* 0003-Disable-resetting-UUID.patch / change-ignition-firstboot-path.conf:
  Remove / overwrite CoreOS specific script / path.
* prevent-boot-cycle.conf:
  If the "files" stage fails the system will be stuck in an infinite
  bootcyle (https://github.com/coreos/ignition-dracut/issues/115); this is
  a workaround to get the system into a defined state.
