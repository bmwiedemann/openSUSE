  <title>Window Manager with a Taskbar</title>
  <description>A window manager for the X Window System that can emulate the look of
Windows '95, OS/2 Warp 3, OS/2 Warp 4, and Motif and tries to take the
best features from those systems. IceWM features multiple workspaces,
opaque move and resize, a taskbar, a window list, mailbox status, and a
digital clock. It is fast and small.</description>
