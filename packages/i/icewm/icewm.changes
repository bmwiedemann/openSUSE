-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Oct 25 20:49:42 UTC 2015 - tchvatal@suse.com

- Deprecate the gnome subpackage as after investigation we figured
  we can simply use icewm-menu-fdo to generate the taskbar menu
  without any need for gnome2 ties.
- Drop binary icewm-set-gnomewm as the gnome2 is not supported anyway
  and thus gconf settings of its defaults are bit pointless

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Fri Oct 23 23:29:22 UTC 2015 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Drop gnome-desktop-devel BuildRequires: That symbol is provided
  by libgnome-desktop-3-devel now, and is not what configure needs,
  nor is looking for. The compat package libgnome-desktop-2-devel
  is the correct one for icewm-gnome, and is already present via
  pkgconfig(gnome-desktop-2.0) BuildRequires.
- Also drop libgnomeui-devel as pkgconfig(libgnomeui-2.0) takes
  care of that.
- Move pkgconfig(gdk-pixbuf-xlib-2.0) BuildRequires: to the with
  gnome section.

  also use systemd to call shutdown and reboot which should be bit more safe
  today:

Mon May  5 14:53:51 CEST 2003 - mfabian@suse.de

- remove "fontconfig fontconfig-devel" from neededforbuild and
  use x-devel-packages instead of xf86
- use "-*-" instead of "-xftdummy-" as the foundry for the
  default fonts when using Xft because the latest fontconfig
  now actually uses the foundry and inserting an dummy value
  doesn't work anymore.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr 25 22:38:59 CEST 2003 - lmfabian@suse.de

- update to 1.2.7
- add "fontconfig fontconfig-devel" to neededforbuild
- icewm-always-use-xft.patch: if we have Xft2, don't disable Xft
  when no RENDER is found.
- remove icewm-menu-translations.tar.bz2: the language specific
  "preferences" files did only set different fontsets, which is
  not necessary anymore when Xft2 is used with generic aliases
  like "sans" and "monospace" as the default settings. The same
  default font settings should work for all languages.
  The other files in icewm-menu-translations.tar.bz2 didn't
  contain any important language specific differences either.
- fix icewm-LANG.menu.patch: look for the most specific extensions
  first: e.g. first try "menu.ja_JP.UTF-8", then try "menu.ja_JP",
  finally try "menu.ja". The current patch did it in the opposite
  order, making it impossible to have different files for
  ja_JP.eucJP and ja_JP.UTF-8.
