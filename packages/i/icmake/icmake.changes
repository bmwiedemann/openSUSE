Mon Oct 20 13:29:02 UTC 2025 - Valentin Lefebvre <valentin.lefebvre@suse.com>

- Remove fixed patches
  [- gcc-13-fix.patch]
  [- reproducible.patch]
  [- prevent-double-slash.patch]
- Fix build of 13.00.01
  [+ fix-lib-path-for-builds-file.patch]
  [+ fix-spch-process.patch]
- Use service file to get tarball source.
- upgrade to 13.00.01
  * Manpages for Debian were updated.
- upgrade to 13.00.00
  * The man-pages were updated and contain specific details about the
    changes since version 12.03.00
  * Option --all was added to icm-spch.
  * Headers inspected by icmake --spch are not modified anymore.
  * The program 'noifndef.cc', available in the icmake's source distribution
    (sub-dir 'build2nd') can be used to remove '#ifnef SPCH_' sections from
    projects' .ih files.
  * 'icmake --source' compiles the icmake script to a temporary .bim file;
  * The support program 'icmun' was renamed to 'icm-un'.
  * The 'icmconf' script can use -o in its #define SPCH specification. All
    (space character delimited) words following -o are passed to 'icm-spch' as
    separate '-o word' options;
  * When developing C++ programs the environment variable ICMAKE_CXXFLAGS
    is no longer used. Instead the environment variable ICMAKE_CPPSTD is
    used. Use this latter environment variable to define one point of
    maintenance specifying the version of the bf(C++) standard used when
    compiling sources.
  * When using Debian (or a comparable distributions) the script 'rebuild' can
    be used to rebuild icmake's binaries after installing 'libbobcat-dev',
    resulting in a reduction of their sizes of about 40%.
  * The 'icmake' program itself was redesigned.
- upgrade to 12.03.00
  * #define IH is only required if #define SPCH or #define PRECOMP is
    specified in the icmconf file.
- upgrade to 12.02.01
  * /usr/share/icmake/icmconf defines IH, required by icmbuild
  * /etc/icmake/icmstart.rc specifies usage.cc and version.cc with Pb, so
    'icmstart -b ...' is recognized
- upgrade to 12.02.00
  * Added the /usr/bin/icmodmap program + man-page
  * Compilations use --std=c++26
- upgrade to 12.00.01
  * Icmake is now completely independent from bobcat.
- upgrade to 12.00.00
  * The icmake construction no longer depends on the availability of the
    (possibly bootstrapped) bobcat library. Bootstrapping is no longer
    required.
  * The /usr/libexec/icmake/icm-spch support program recognizes
  * When icmstart optionally installs a directory it also requests whether the
    directory name should be added to the CLASSES file
  * The icmake man-page received some cosmetic changes
- upgrade to 11.01.02
  * Repaired a failing comparison between signed/unsigned values only
    appearing in 32-bit architectures.
- upgrade to 11.01.01
  * Repaired an issue when converting to 11.00.00 with 'icmake -c ...'
  * For backward compatibility ICMAKE_CXXFLAGS is still recognized by
    icmbuild and support programs.
- upgrade to 11.01.00
  * The environment variable ICMAKE_CXXFLAGS was replaced by ICMAKE_CPPSTD
  * Earlier FTBFS problems in a clean chroot environment were caused by not
    having defined the ICMAKE_CXXFLAGS environment variable
  * Internal redesign: all filesystem functions used by at least two functions
    are now defined in support/tools
- upgrade to 11.00.00
  * New major version supports using Single Pre-Compiled Headers and
    multi-threaded compilation, significantly reducing the compilation time of
    the source files of projects compared to situations where these facilities
    are not used. The icmake and icmconf manuals were updated accordingly.
- upgrade to 10.06.01
  * icm_bootstrap was slightly modified: when the man-pages are available in
    the ./doc directory Yodl isn't called to create them. Pre-built man-pages
    are only used when constructing the icmake_*.orig.tar.gz tar file, to allow
    the debian package to be constructed w/o being dependent on Yodl, as that
    would introduce a circular dependency.
- upgrade to 10.06.00
  * Updated the QUICKINSTALL file and repaired bugs / improved the comment in
    icm_prepare, icm_bootstrap and icm_install scripts.
  * The CPPENVOPTS environment variable is no longer used. Instead use the
    ICMAKE_CXXFLAGS environment variable (cf. the icmconf(7) man-page).
  * The icm_prepare, icm_bootstrap, and icm_install scripts received a major
    upgrade
- upgrade to 10.05.01
  * Repaired typo in icmstript.yo
- upgrade to 10.05.00
  * When compiling C++ programs the icmconf file by default specifies the
    options
        -Werror -Wall -O2
    As before, additional options can be added to the CXXFLAGS specification
    in the icmconf file, but it's also possible to define additional options
    in the environment variable CPPENVOPTS (cf. the icmconf(7) man-page).
  * This is the last entry in gitlab's 'master' branch. This version and
    future versions will be committed to gitlab's 'main' branch.
- upgrade to 10.04.01
  * Processed Tony Mancill's merge request to fix Matthias Klose's debian bug
    report #1037691.
  * Updated the C++ standard version in ./c++std to --std=c++23.
- upgrade to 10.04.00
  * Replaced 'typedef' definitions by 'using' declarations
  * Input file lists are now sorted (following a gitlab merge request by
    Bernhard M. Wiedemann), resulting in icmake offering reproducible builds
    (cf https://reproducible-builds.org/).
- upgrade to 10.03.03
  * Updated the usr/share/icmake files: the parser/ and scanner/ files are
    now more in line with the current versions of bisonc++ and flexc++
- upgrade to 10.03.02
  * Added the 'bobcatbootstrap' script to perform an initial installation of
    icmake when the bobcat library isn't yet available. See the
    README.bobcatbootstrap file and/or the usage info at the top of the
    'bobcatbootstrap' script
  * The bootstrap/flags file now loads the standard specified in 'c++std'
- upgrade to 10.03.01
  * Ready for libbobcat6
  * Added 'c++std' defining the c++ standard to use for
    compilation. Compilation commands also use -Werror

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug 26 09:58:33 UTC 2022 - Valentin Lefebvre <valentin.lefebvre@suse.com>
- upgrade to 10.03.00
  * On little-engine architectures icmake 10.02.00 should not be used as it
    only writes the least significant bytes of multi-byte values to its .bim
    files. This error was repaired in version 10.03.00
- upgrade to 10.02.00  
  * Daniel Bungert noticed that icmake couldn't be used on big-endian
    architectures (like the s390x emulator). The bug was caused by icmake
    using little-endian number representations in its .bim files. Starting
    this version little-endian number representations are still used in the
    .bim files, but on big-endian acrchitectures numbers are converted to
    little-endian representations before writing them to the .bim files and
    converted to big-endian representations when reading numbers from .bim
    files.
  * A cosmetic flaw was fixed in the output of the icmake unassembler.
- upgrade to 10.01.00
  * Simplified -t argument handling in icmake
  * The icmake program (again) recognizes but ignores the -q option. Existing
    icmake scripts specifying -q should not be processed by icmake
    10.00.00. Icmake users are advised to remove -q options from their icmake
    scripts.
  * Calling icmake without action option results in an error.
- upgrade to 10.00.00
  * Icmake and its support programs now converted to C++
  * Added a new manpage: icmscript(7), describing the syntaxis, construction
    and predefined support functions and other characteristics of icmake
    scripts. 
  * Added new options --no-process (-N), --unassemble (-u), and --verbose (-V)
    to icmake, 
  * Icmake's option --summary) (-F) has been discontinued.
  * Added new options --no-version-check (-n) to icm-exec and icmun
  * Added new option -P (no pre-processing) to --compile and --force
  * The --source short option -i has been replaced by -s;
  * The predefined functions printf and fprintf also support the << insertion
    operator (comparable to C++'s std::ostream class).
  * Changed the organization of the class-dependencies matrices shown by
    'icmake -d' (icm_dep), simplifying visual inspection of circular
    class-dependencies 
  * Fixed a flaw in handling precompiled headers in the std. icmbuild script
    causing precompilation of modified headers at the second icmbuild run.
- new library file icmstart.bim comming from commit ecb0d3f1
 [10.03.00.tar.bz2]

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat May  8 14:03:59 UTC 2021 - Ferdinand Thiessen <rpm@fthiessen.de>

- Fixed SourceUrl

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan 17 13:51:37 UTC 2020 - Josef Möllers <josef.moellers@suse.com>

- Upgrade to 9.03.01
  * updated the usr/share/icmake/icmconf file
  * Removed an error (#-lines are comment) in the icmconf(7) man-page
  * Fixed icmbuild's install command wrt installing libraries
  * Using ctrl-C while executing icmstart no longer requires a terminal
    reset when using bash as command shell (in fact: icm-exec restores
    the initial terminal (stdin) configuration when terminated by ctrl-C).
  * The standard icmake skeleton files specify namespace Icmake instead of
    the previously used namespace Icmbuild.
  * The icmbuild strip command is discontinued: use -s instead
  * Stripping (-s) can only be specified when installing
  * icmbuild options -c can only be specified when building libraries or
    programs
  * Redesigned icm-comp's implementation
  * Changed icm-exec's int comparison function: returns 1 if equal, 0 if not
  * The file 'version.cc' wasn't correctly recognized in
    /usr/lib/icmake/icmbuild: fixed in this release.
  * Fixed unintended termination of /usr/lib/icmake/icmbuild caused by
    non-existing .gch files (when PRECOMP was specified; this happened
    when a directory only contained a header, but no sources).
  [9.03.01.tar.gz]

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb  7 15:32:28 UTC 2017 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Explicitly package %{_docdir}/%{name} to fix build with RPM 4.13.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb  2 13:09:42 UTC 2017 - josef.moellers@suse.com

- Upgrade to 9.02.02
  * Fixed an annoying typo in [/usr/lib/icmake/]icmbuild. 
- Upgrade to 9.02.01
  * Fixed a flaw in [/usr/lib/icmake/]icmbuild: when DEFCOM "library" was
    defined in icmconf, and precompiled headers were requested, then MAIN had
    to be defined as well. This is not required anymore.
- Upgrade to 9.02.00
  * icmbuild now is a small program, providing help or starting the icmbuild
    script in LIBDIR (cf. INSTALL)
  * Man-pages were updated
  * Cosmetic changes to icmake --help's output
  * The name of the optional configuration file YEAR was changed to YEARS
    (as it defines YEARS, not YEAR)
  * `icmconf' was added to /etc/icmake/icmstart.rc
  * As mentioned in icmake's man-page the program `icmun' is mainly used in 
    some specific situations. In icmake's daily practice it isn't
    used. Therefore it was moved from the standard binary programs directory
    to icmake's LIB directory (commonly /usr/lib/icmake).
  * The file /etc/icmake/icmake.rc was nowhere used and was removed.
- Upgrade to 9.01.00
  * Man-pages weren't properly updated at 9.00.00. This was fixed in this
    release. 
- Upgrade to 9.00.00
  * Added support program icm-dep computing dependencies for USE_ALL classes
    and precompiled headers, called from /usr/bin/icmbuild, or directly using
    icmake's option --icm-dep (-d)
  * Icmake supports several long options in addition to the standard short
    options. See icmake(1) for details.
  * Changed references to IS_* into O_* in icmake(1)'s man-page. The IS_
    entries were already unavailable, but the man-page still referred to
    them. Now fixed.
  * Contents of lines in CLASSES beyond the first word are no longer
    interpreted.
  * Added new option NO_PRECOMP_WARNING to icmconf
  * Option -b was removed from icmake.
  * The built-in function makelist(mask, [younger,older], referencefile) is now
    operational (was mentioned in icmake's man-page, but wasn't implemented
    before).
  * Repaired a bug in substr that could segfault.
  * Man-pages updated. Icmbuild(1) contains a description of the icm-dep
    program.
