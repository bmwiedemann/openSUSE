- upgrade to 10.03.00
  * On little-engine architectures icmake 10.02.00 should not be used as it
    only writes the least significant bytes of multi-byte values to its .bim
    files. This error was repaired in version 10.03.00
- upgrade to 10.02.00  
  * Daniel Bungert noticed that icmake couldn't be used on big-endian
    architectures (like the s390x emulator). The bug was caused by icmake
    using little-endian number representations in its .bim files. Starting
    this version little-endian number representations are still used in the
    .bim files, but on big-endian acrchitectures numbers are converted to
    little-endian representations before writing them to the .bim files and
    converted to big-endian representations when reading numbers from .bim
    files.
  * A cosmetic flaw was fixed in the output of the icmake unassembler.
- upgrade to 10.01.00
  * Simplified -t argument handling in icmake
  * The icmake program (again) recognizes but ignores the -q option. Existing
    icmake scripts specifying -q should not be processed by icmake
    10.00.00. Icmake users are advised to remove -q options from their icmake
    scripts.
  * Calling icmake without action option results in an error.
- upgrade to 10.00.00
  * Icmake and its support programs now converted to C++
  * Added a new manpage: icmscript(7), describing the syntaxis, construction
    and predefined support functions and other characteristics of icmake
    scripts. 
  * Added new options --no-process (-N), --unassemble (-u), and --verbose (-V)
    to icmake, 
  * Icmake's option --summary) (-F) has been discontinued.
  * Added new options --no-version-check (-n) to icm-exec and icmun
  * Added new option -P (no pre-processing) to --compile and --force
  * The --source short option -i has been replaced by -s;
  * The predefined functions printf and fprintf also support the << insertion
    operator (comparable to C++'s std::ostream class).
  * Changed the organization of the class-dependencies matrices shown by
    'icmake -d' (icm_dep), simplifying visual inspection of circular
    class-dependencies 
  * Fixed a flaw in handling precompiled headers in the std. icmbuild script
    causing precompilation of modified headers at the second icmbuild run.
- new library file icmstart.bim comming from commit ecb0d3f1
 [10.03.00.tar.bz2]

Sat May  8 14:03:59 UTC 2021 - Ferdinand Thiessen <rpm@fthiessen.de>

- Fixed SourceUrl

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan 17 13:51:37 UTC 2020 - Josef Möllers <josef.moellers@suse.com>

- Upgrade to 9.03.01
  * updated the usr/share/icmake/icmconf file
  * Removed an error (#-lines are comment) in the icmconf(7) man-page
  * Fixed icmbuild's install command wrt installing libraries
  * Using ctrl-C while executing icmstart no longer requires a terminal
    reset when using bash as command shell (in fact: icm-exec restores
    the initial terminal (stdin) configuration when terminated by ctrl-C).
  * The standard icmake skeleton files specify namespace Icmake instead of
    the previously used namespace Icmbuild.
  * The icmbuild strip command is discontinued: use -s instead
  * Stripping (-s) can only be specified when installing
  * icmbuild options -c can only be specified when building libraries or
    programs
  * Redesigned icm-comp's implementation
  * Changed icm-exec's int comparison function: returns 1 if equal, 0 if not
  * The file 'version.cc' wasn't correctly recognized in
    /usr/lib/icmake/icmbuild: fixed in this release.
  * Fixed unintended termination of /usr/lib/icmake/icmbuild caused by
    non-existing .gch files (when PRECOMP was specified; this happened
    when a directory only contained a header, but no sources).
  [9.03.01.tar.gz]

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb  7 15:32:28 UTC 2017 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Explicitly package %{_docdir}/%{name} to fix build with RPM 4.13.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb  2 13:09:42 UTC 2017 - josef.moellers@suse.com

- Upgrade to 9.02.02
  * Fixed an annoying typo in [/usr/lib/icmake/]icmbuild. 
- Upgrade to 9.02.01
  * Fixed a flaw in [/usr/lib/icmake/]icmbuild: when DEFCOM "library" was
    defined in icmconf, and precompiled headers were requested, then MAIN had
    to be defined as well. This is not required anymore.
- Upgrade to 9.02.00
  * icmbuild now is a small program, providing help or starting the icmbuild
    script in LIBDIR (cf. INSTALL)
  * Man-pages were updated
  * Cosmetic changes to icmake --help's output
  * The name of the optional configuration file YEAR was changed to YEARS
    (as it defines YEARS, not YEAR)
  * `icmconf' was added to /etc/icmake/icmstart.rc
  * As mentioned in icmake's man-page the program `icmun' is mainly used in 
    some specific situations. In icmake's daily practice it isn't
    used. Therefore it was moved from the standard binary programs directory
    to icmake's LIB directory (commonly /usr/lib/icmake).
  * The file /etc/icmake/icmake.rc was nowhere used and was removed.
- Upgrade to 9.01.00
  * Man-pages weren't properly updated at 9.00.00. This was fixed in this
    release. 
- Upgrade to 9.00.00
  * Added support program icm-dep computing dependencies for USE_ALL classes
    and precompiled headers, called from /usr/bin/icmbuild, or directly using
    icmake's option --icm-dep (-d)
  * Icmake supports several long options in addition to the standard short
    options. See icmake(1) for details.
  * Changed references to IS_* into O_* in icmake(1)'s man-page. The IS_
    entries were already unavailable, but the man-page still referred to
    them. Now fixed.
  * Contents of lines in CLASSES beyond the first word are no longer
    interpreted.
  * Added new option NO_PRECOMP_WARNING to icmconf
  * Option -b was removed from icmake.
  * The built-in function makelist(mask, [younger,older], referencefile) is now
    operational (was mentioned in icmake's man-page, but wasn't implemented
    before).
  * Repaired a bug in substr that could segfault.
  * Man-pages updated. Icmbuild(1) contains a description of the icm-dep
    program.
