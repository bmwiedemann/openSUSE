- Explicitly package %{_docdir}/%{name} to fix build with RPM 4.13.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- Upgrade to 9.02.02
  * Fixed an annoying typo in [/usr/lib/icmake/]icmbuild. 
- Upgrade to 9.02.01
  * Fixed a flaw in [/usr/lib/icmake/]icmbuild: when DEFCOM "library" was
    defined in icmconf, and precompiled headers were requested, then MAIN had
    to be defined as well. This is not required anymore.
- Upgrade to 9.02.00
  * icmbuild now is a small program, providing help or starting the icmbuild
    script in LIBDIR (cf. INSTALL)
  * Man-pages were updated
  * Cosmetic changes to icmake --help's output
  * The name of the optional configuration file YEAR was changed to YEARS
    (as it defines YEARS, not YEAR)
  * `icmconf' was added to /etc/icmake/icmstart.rc
  * As mentioned in icmake's man-page the program `icmun' is mainly used in 
    some specific situations. In icmake's daily practice it isn't
    used. Therefore it was moved from the standard binary programs directory
    to icmake's LIB directory (commonly /usr/lib/icmake).
  * The file /etc/icmake/icmake.rc was nowhere used and was removed.
- Upgrade to 9.01.00
  * Man-pages weren't properly updated at 9.00.00. This was fixed in this
    release. 
- Upgrade to 9.00.00
  * Added support program icm-dep computing dependencies for USE_ALL classes
    and precompiled headers, called from /usr/bin/icmbuild, or directly using
    icmake's option --icm-dep (-d)
  * Icmake supports several long options in addition to the standard short
    options. See icmake(1) for details.
  * Changed references to IS_* into O_* in icmake(1)'s man-page. The IS_
    entries were already unavailable, but the man-page still referred to
    them. Now fixed.
  * Contents of lines in CLASSES beyond the first word are no longer
    interpreted.
  * Added new option NO_PRECOMP_WARNING to icmconf
  * Option -b was removed from icmake.
  * The built-in function makelist(mask, [younger,older], referencefile) is now
    operational (was mentioned in icmake's man-page, but wasn't implemented
    before).
  * Repaired a bug in substr that could segfault.
  * Man-pages updated. Icmbuild(1) contains a description of the icm-dep
    program.
