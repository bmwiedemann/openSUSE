  <title>A Command Line Editor for ID3 V2 tags</title>
  <description>ID3 tags are found in MP3 files. They can store information about what
band recorded the song, the song name, and more.
ID3-V1 tags are seriously deficient as to the kind of and length of
information that they can store. This is a tool for editing ID3-V2 tags
in Linux.</description>
