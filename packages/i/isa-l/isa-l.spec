Optimized low-level functions targeting storage applications.

%package -n igzip
Summary:        gzip backed by the ISA-L deflate library
Group:	        Productivity/Archiving/Compression

%description -n igzip
igzip compresses and decompresses files similar to gzip using the
ISA-L deflate library.

Output .gz files are compatible with gzip and RFC 1952.

Summary:        Intel Intelligent Storage Acceleration Library
Group:          System/Libraries

%description -n libisal2
ISA-L is a collection of optimized low-level functions targeting
storage applications. ISA-L includes:

* Erasure codes: Block Reed-Solomon type erasure codes for any
  encode/decode matrix in GF(2^8).
* CRC Implementations of cyclic redundancy check. Six different
  polynomials supported: iscsi32, ieee32, t10dif, ecma64, iso64,
  jones64.
* RAID calculation and operation on XOR and P+Q parity found in
  common RAID implementations.
* Compression of deflate-compatible data compression.
* De-compression of inflate-compatible data compression.

This package contains the development headers for the library found
in libisal2.
