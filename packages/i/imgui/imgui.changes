- update to v1.89.2:
  * Tables, Nav, Scrolling: fixed scrolling functions and focus tracking
    with frozen rows and frozen columns. Windows now have a better
    understanding of outer/inner decoration sizes, which should later lead
    us toward more flexible uses of menu/status bars. (#5143, #3692)
  * Tables, Nav: frozen columns are not part of menu layer and can be
    crossed over. (#5143, #3692)
  * Tables, Columns: fixed cases where empty columns may lead to empty
    ImDrawCmd. (#4857, #5937)
  * Tables: fixed matching width of synchronized tables (multiple tables
    with same id) when only some instances have a vertical scrollbar and not
    all. (#5920)
  * Fixed cases where CTRL+Tab or Modal can occasionally lead to the
    creation of ImDrawCmd with zero triangles, which would makes the render
    loop of some backends assert (e.g. Metal with debugging, Allegro).
    (#4857, #5937)
  * Inputs, IO: reworked ImGuiMod_Shortcut to redirect to Ctrl/Super at
    runtime instead of compile-time, being consistent with our support for
    io.ConfigMacOSXBehaviors and making it easier for bindings generators to
    process that value. (#5923, #456)
  * Inputs, Scrolling: better selection of scrolling window when hovering
    nested windows and when backend/OS is emitting dual-axis wheeling inputs
    (typically touch pads on macOS). We now select a primary axis based on
    recent events, and select a target window based on it. We expect this
    behavior to be further improved/tweaked. (#3795, #4559) [@ocornut,
    @folays]
  * InputText: fixed cursor navigation when pressing Up Arrow on the last
    character of a multi-line buffer which doesn't end with a carriage
    return. (#6000)
  * Text: fixed layouting of wrapped-text block when the last source line is
    above the clipping region. Regression added in 1.89. (#5720, #5919)
  * Misc: added GetItemID() in public API. It is not often expected that you
    would use this, but it is useful for Shortcut() and upcoming owner-aware
    input functions which wants to be implemented with public API.
  * Fonts: imgui_freetype: fixed a packing issue which in some occurrences
    would prevent large amount of glyphs from being packed correctly.
    (#5788, #5829)
  * Fonts: added a void* UserData field in ImFontAtlas, as a convenience for
    use by applications using multiple font atlases.
  * Demo: simplified "Inputs" section, moved contents to Metrics->Inputs.
  * Debug Tools: Metrics: added "Inputs" section, moved from Demo for
    consistency.
  * Misc: fixed parameters to IMGUI_DEBUG_LOG() not being dead-stripped when
    building with IMGUI_DISABLE_DEBUG_TOOLS is used. (#5901) [@Teselka]
  * Misc: fixed compile-time detection of SSE features on MSVC 32-bits
    builds. (#5943) [@TheMostDiligent]
  * Examples: DirectX10, DirectX11: try WARP software driver if hardware
    driver is not available. (#5924, #5562)
  * Backends: GLFW: Fixed mods state on Linux when using Alt-GR text input
    (e.g. German keyboard layout), which could lead to broken text input.
    Revert a 2022/01/17 change were we resumed using mods provided by GLFW,
    turns out they are faulty in this specific situation. (#6034)
  * Backends: Allegro5: restoring using al_draw_indexed_prim() when Allegro
    version is >= 5.2.5. (#5937) [@Espyo]
  * Backends: Vulkan: Fixed sampler passed to ImGui_ImplVulkan_AddTexture()
    not being honored as we were using an immutable sampler. (#5502, #6001,
    #914) [@martin-ejdestig, @rytisss]

ship any actual functionality. ImGui suppose to be used as sources
