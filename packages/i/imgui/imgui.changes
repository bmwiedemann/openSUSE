- update to 1.91.0:
 Breaking Changes:
  * IO, IME: renamed platform IME hook and added explicit context for
    consistency and future-proofness.
      old: io.SetPlatformImeDataFn(ImGuiViewport* viewport, 
      ImGuiPlatformImeData* data);
      new: io.PlatformSetImeDataFn(ImGuiContext* ctx, ImGuiViewport*
      viewport, ImGuiPlatformImeData* data);
      It is expected that for a vast majority of users this is 
      automatically set by core library and/or platform backend so 
      it won't have any effect.
  * Obsoleted GetContentRegionMax(), GetWindowContentRegionMin() and
    GetWindowContentRegionMax(). (information thread: #7838)
    You should never need those functions! You can do everything in 
    less a confusing manner by only using GetCursorScreenPos() and
    GetContentRegionAvail(). Also always consider that if you are
    using GetWindowPos() and GetCursorPos() you may also be making
    things unnecessarily complicated.
    I repeat: You can do everything with GetCursorScreenPos()
    and GetContentRegionAvail()!
      GetWindowContentRegionMax().x - GetCursorPos().x --> 
      GetContentRegionAvail().x
      GetWindowContentRegionMax().x + GetWindowPos().x --> 
      GetCursorScreenPos().x + GetContentRegionAvail().x 
      // when called from left edge of window
      GetContentRegionMax() --> GetContentRegionAvail() + GetCursorScreenPos()
      - GetWindowPos() // right edge in local coordinates
      GetWindowContentRegionMax().x - GetWindowContentRegionMin().x -->
      GetContentRegionAvail() // when called from left edge of window
  * Item flag changes:
      Obsoleted PushButtonRepeat()/PopButtonRepeat() in favor of using
      new PushItemFlag()/PopItemFlag() with ImGuiItemFlags_ButtonRepeat.
      Kept inline redirecting functions (will obsolete).
      Obsoleted PushTabStop()/PopTabStop() in favor of using new 
      PushItemFlag()/PopItemFlag() with ImGuiItemFlags_NoTabStop.
      Kept inline redirecting functions (will obsolete).
      Renamed ImGuiSelectableFlags_DontClosePopups to 
      ImGuiSelectableFlags_NoAutoClosePopups for consistency. Kept inline
      redirecting functions (will obsolete). + Internals: 
      changed/inverted ImGuiItemFlags_SelectableDontClosePopup (default==false) to
      ImGuiItemFlags_AutoClosePopups (default==true), same logic, 
      only inverted behavior. (#1379, #1468, #2200, #4936, #5216, #7302, #7573)
  * Commented out obsolete ImGuiModFlags (renamed to ImGuiKeyChord in 1.89).
    (#4921, #456)
  * Commented out obsolete ImGuiModFlags_XXX values 
    (renamed to ImGuiMod_XXX in 1.89). (#4921, #456)
      ImGuiModFlags_Ctrl -> ImGuiMod_Ctrl, ImGuiModFlags_Shift -> 
      ImGuiMod_Shift etc.
  * Backends: GLFW+Emscripten: Renamed 
    ImGui_ImplGlfw_InstallEmscriptenCanvasResizeCallback()
    to ImGui_ImplGlfw_InstallEmscriptenCallbacks(), with an
    additional GLFWWindow* parameter. (#7647) [@ypujante]
  
 Other Changes
  * Added TextLink(), TextLinkOpenURL() hyperlink widgets. (#7660)
  * IO: added io.PlatformOpenInShellFn() handler to open a 
    link/folder/file in OS shell. (#7660)
    Added IMGUI_DISABLE_DEFAULT_SHELL_FUNCTIONS to disable
    default Windows/Linux/Mac implementation.
  * IO: added io.ConfigNavSwapGamepadButtons to swap Activate/Cancel
    (A<>B) buttons, to match the typical "Nintendo/Japanese consoles"
    button layout when using Gamepad navigation. (#787, #5723)
  * Added PushItemFlag()/PopItemFlags(), ImGuiItemFlags to modify shared
    item flags:
      Added ImGuiItemFlags_NoTabStop to disable tabbing through items.
      Added ImGuiItemFlags_NoNav to disable any navigation and focus
      of items. (#787)
      Added ImGuiItemFlags_NoNavDefaultFocus to disable item being 
      default focus. (#787)
      Added ImGuiItemFlags_ButtonRepeat to enable repeat on any 
      button-like behavior.
      Added ImGuiItemFlags_AutoClosePopups to disable menu 
      items/selection auto closing parent popups.
      Disabling this was previously possible for Selectable() via a direct
      flag but not for MenuItem(). (#1379, #1468, #2200, #4936, #5216, #7302, #7573)
      This was mostly all previously in imgui_internal.h.
  * Multi-Select: added multi-select API and demos. (#1861, #6518)
      This system implements standard multi-selection idioms (CTRL+mouse 
      click, CTRL+keyboard moves, SHIFT+mouse click, SHIFT+keyboard moves,
      etc.) with support for clipper (not submitting non-visible items), 
      box-selection with scrolling, and many other details.
      In the spirit of Dear ImGui design, your code owns both items and actual
      selection data. This is designed to allow all kinds of selection storage
      you may use in your application (e.g. set/map/hash, intrusive selection,
      interval trees, up to you).
      The supported widgets are Selectable(), Checkbox(). TreeNode() is also 
      technically supported but... using this correctly is more complicated.
      You need some sort of linear/random access to your tree, which is suited
      to advanced trees setups already implementing filters and clipper. 
      We will work toward simplifying our existing demo for trees.
      A helper ImGuiSelectionBasicStorage is provided to facilitate getting 
      started in a typical app (likely to suit a majority of users).
      Documentation:
        Wiki page https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/wiki/Multi-Select for 
        API overview.
        Demo code + headers are well commented.
      Added BeginMultiSelect(), EndMultiSelect(), SetNextItemSelectionUserData().
      Added IsItemToggledSelection() for use if you need latest selection
      update during current iteration.
      Added ImGuiMultiSelectIO and ImGuiSelectionRequest structures:
        BeginMultiSelect() and EndMultiSelect() return a ImGuiMultiSelectIO
        structure, which is mostly an array of ImGuiSelectionRequest actions
        (clear, select all, set range, etc.)
        Other fields are helpful when using a clipper, or wanting to handle
        deletion nicely.
      Added ImGuiSelectionBasicStorage helper to store and maintain a 
      selection (optional):
        This is similar to if you used e.g. a std::set to store a selection,
        with all the right glue to honor ImGuiMultiSelectIO requests. 
        Most applications can use that.
      Added ImGuiSelectionExternalStorage helper to maintain an externally
      stored selection (optional):
        Helpful to easily bind multi-selection to e.g. an array of checkboxes.
      Added ImGuiMultiSelectFlags options:
        ImGuiMultiSelectFlags_SingleSelect: Disable selecting more than one item.
        This is available to allow single-selection code to share same code/logic
        if desired. It essential...

Fri Jul 26 06:22:12 UTC 2024 - Frantisek Simorda <frantisek.simorda@suse.com>

- - Update to 1.90.9
    Removed old nested structure: renaming ImGuiStorage::ImGuiStoragePair type to ImGuiStoragePair (simpler for many languages). No significant nested type left.
    BeginChild: added ImGuiChildFlags_NavFlattened as a replacement for the window flag ImGuiWindowFlags_NavFlattened: the feature only ever made sense for BeginChild() calls anyhow. (#7687) 
        old: BeginChild("Name", size, 0, ImGuiWindowFlags_NavFlattened);
        new: BeginChild("Name", size, ImGuiChildFlags_NavFlattened, 0)
        Kept inline redirection flag (will obsolete).
    Style: renamed tab colors for clarity and consistency with other changes: (#261, #351)
        ImGuiCol_TabActive -> ImGuiCol_TabSelected
        ImGuiCol_TabUnfocused -> ImGuiCol_TabDimmed
        ImGuiCol_TabUnfocusedActive -> ImGuiCol_TabDimmedSelected
        Kept inline redirecting enums (will obsolete).
    IO: io.ClearInputKeys() (first exposed in 1.89.8) doesn't clear mouse data. Newly added io.ClearInputMouse() does. (#4921)
    Drag and Drop: renamed ImGuiDragDropFlags_SourceAutoExpirePayload to ImGuiDragDropFlags_PayloadAutoExpire. Kept inline redirecting enum (will obsolete). (#1725, #143)
    IO: do not disable io.ConfigWindowsResizeFromEdges (which allow resizing from borders and lower-left corner) when ImGuiBackendFlags_HasMouseCursors is not set by backend. The initial reasoning is that resizing from borders feels better when correct mouse cursor shape change as honored by backends. Keeping this enabling will hopefully increase pressure on third-party backends to set ImGuiBackendFlags_HasMouseCursors and honor changes of ImGui::GetMouseCursor() value. (#1495)
    IO: do not claim io.WantCaptureMouse=true on the mouse release frame of a button which was pressed over void/underlying app, which is consistent/needed to allow the mouse up event of a drag over void/underlying app to catch release. (#1392) 
    IO: Added io.ClearInputMouse() to clear mouse state. (#4921)
    Windows: BeginChild(): fixed a glitch when during a resize of a child window which is tightly close to the boundaries of its parent (e.g. with zero WindowPadding), the child position could have temporarily be moved around by erroneous padding application. (#7706)
    TabBar, Style: added ImGuiTabBarFlags_DrawSelectedOverline option to draw an horizontal line over selected tabs to increase visibility. This is used by docking. Added corresponding ImGuiCol_TabSelectedOverline and ImGuiCol_TabDimmedSelectedOverline colors.
    Tables: added TableGetHoveredColumn() to public API, as an alternative to testing for TableGetColumnFlags(column) & ImGuiTableColumnFlags_IsHovered on each column. (#3740)
    Disabled, Inputs: fixed using Shortcut() or SetNextItemShortcut() within a disabled block bypassing the disabled state. (#7726)
    Disabled: Reworked 1.90.8 behavior of Begin() not inheriting current BeginDisabled() state, to make it that only tooltip windows are temporarily clearing it. (#211, #7640)
    Drags: added ImGuiSliderFlags_WrapAround flag for DragInt(), DragFloat() etc. (#7749)
    Drag and Drop: BeginDragDropSource() with ImGuiDragDropFlags_SourceExtern sets active id so a multi-frame extern source doesn't interfere with hovered widgets. (#143)
    Drag and Drop: BeginDragDropSource() with ImGuiDragDropFlags_SourceExtern does not assume a mouse button being pressed. Facilitate implementing cross-context drag and drop. (#143)
    Drag and Drop: Added ImGuiDragDropFlags_PayloadNoCrossContext/ImGuiDragDropFlags_PayloadNoCrossProcess flags as metadata to specify that a payload may not be copied outside the context/process by some logic aiming to copy payloads around.
    Drag and Drop: Fixes an issue when elapsing payload would be based on last payload frame instead of last drag source frame, which makes a difference if not resubmitting payload every frame. (#143)
    Debug Tools: Metrics/Debugger: Browsing a Storage perform hover lookup on identifier.
    Viewports: Backported void* ImGuiViewport::PlatformHandle from docking branch for use by backends.
    imgui_freetype: Fixed divide by zero while handling FT_PIXEL_MODE_BGRA glyphs. (#7267, #3369)
    Backends: OpenGL2, OpenGL3: ImGui_ImplOpenGL3_NewFrame() recreates font texture if it has been destroyed by ImGui_ImplOpenGL3_DestroyFontsTexture(). (#7748) 
    Backends: SDL3: Update for API removal of keysym field in SDL_KeyboardEvent. (#7728)
    Backends: SDL3: Update for SDL_StartTextInput()/SDL_StopTextInput() API changes. (#7735)
    Backends: SDL3: Update for SDL_SetTextInputRect() API rename. (#7760, #7754) 
    Backends: SDLRenderer3: Update for SDL_RenderGeometryRaw() API changes. (SDL#9009).
    Backends: Vulkan: Remove Volk/ from volk.h #include directives. (#7722, #6582, #4854) 
    Examples: SDL3: Remove use of SDL_HINT_IME_NATIVE_UI since new SDL_HINT_IME_IMPLEMENTED_UI values has a more suitable default for our case case.
    Examples: GLFW+Vulkan, SDL+Vulkan: handle swap chain resize even without Vulkan returning VK_SUBOPTIMAL_KHR, which doesn't seem to happen on Wayland. (#7671) 

- Changes of 1.90.8
    Reordered various ImGuiInputTextFlags values. This should NOT be breaking unless you are using generated headers that have values not matching the main library.
    Removed ImGuiButtonFlags_MouseButtonDefault_ = ImGuiButtonFlags_MouseButtonLeft from imgui.h, was mostly unused and misleading.
    Inputs: Fixed IsMouseClicked(..., repeat=true); broken in 1.90.7 on 2024/05/22. (due to an internal api parameter swap, repeat wouldn't be honored and ownership would be accidentally checked even though this api is meant to not
    check ownership). (#7657) 
    Windows: fixed altering FramePadding mid-frame not correctly affecting logic responsible for honoring io.ConfigWindowsMoveFromTitleBarOnly. (#7576, #899)
    Scrollbar: made scrolling logic more standard: clicking above or below the grab scrolls by one page, holding mouse button repeats scrolling. (#7328, #150)
    Scrollbar: fixed miscalculation of vertical scrollbar visibility when required solely by the presence of an horizontal scrollbar. (#1574)
    InputScalar, InputInt, InputFloat: added ImGuiInputTextFlags_ParseEmptyRefVal to parse an empty field as zero-value. (#7305) 
    InputScalar, InputInt, InputFloat: added ImGuiInputTextFlags_DisplayEmptyRefVal to display a zero-value as empty. (#7305) 
    Popups: fixed an issue preventing to close a popup opened over a modal by clicking over void (it required clicking over the visible part of the modal). (#7654)
    Tables: fixed an issue where ideal size reported to parent container wouldn't correctly take account of inner scrollbar, affecting potential auto-resize of parent container. (#7651)
    Tables: fixed a bug where after disabling the ScrollY flag for a table, previous scrollbar width would be accounted for. (#5920)
    Combo: simplified Combo() API uses a list clipper (due to its api it wasn't previously trivial before we added clipper.IncludeItemByIndex() function).
    Disabled: nested tooltips or other non-child window within a BeginDisabled() block disable the disabled state. (#211, #7640)
    Misc: made ImGuiDir and ImGuiSortDirection stronger-typed enums.
    Backends: SDL3: Update for SDL_SYSTEM_CURSOR_xxx api renames. (#7653)
    RangeSelect/MultiSelect: Box-Select: when dragging from void, first hit item sets NavId so navigation can resume from that spot.
    RangeSelect/MultiSelect: (breaking) Added optional 'items_count' parameter to BeginMultiSelect(). Will enable extra features, and remove equivalent parameter from ImGuiSelectionBasicStorage::ApplyRequests().
    RangeSelect/MultiSelect: (breaking) renamed ImGuiMultiSelectFlags_BoxSelect -> ImGuiMultiSelectFlags_BoxSelect1d, ImGuiMultiSelectFlags_BoxSelect2d -> ImGuiMultiSelectFlags_BoxSelect.
    RangeSelect/MultiSelect: (breaking) ImGuiSelectionBasicStorage: renamed AdapterData to UserData.
    RangeSelect/MultiSelect: ImGuiSelectionBasicStorage: added GetStorageIdFromIndex() method indirection to be easier on the reader.
    RangeSelect/MultiSelect: ImGuiSelectionBasicStorage: fixed Swap() helper.
    RangeSelect/MultiSelect: added ImGuiSelectionExternalStorage helper. Simplify checkboxes/bool demo.
    RangeSelect/MultiSelect: Box-select: fixes for checkboxes support.
    RangeSelect/MultiSelect: mark parent child window as navigable into, with highlight visible when pressing Escape.


- Changes of 1.90.7
    Inputs: on macOS X, Cmd and Ctrl keys are now automatically swapped by io.AddKeyEvent(), as this naturally align with how macOS X uses those keys. (#2343, #4084, #5923, #456)
        Effectively it means that e.g. ImGuiMod_Ctrl | ImGuiKey_C is a valid idiomatic shortcut for both Windows and Mac style users.
        It shouldn't really affect your code unless you had explicit/custom shortcut swapping in place for macOS X apps in your input logic.
        Removed ImGuiMod_Shortcut which was previously dynamically remapping to Ctrl or Cmd/Super. It is now unnecessary to specific cross-platform idiomatic shortcuts. Kept symbols redirecting ImGuiMod_Shortcut to ImGuiMod_Ctrl (will obsolete).
    Commented out obsolete symbols renamed in 1.88 (May 2022):
        CaptureKeyboardFromApp() -> SetNextFrameWantCaptureKeyboard()
        CaptureMouseFromApp() -> SetNextFrameWantCaptureMouse()
    Backends: SDL_Renderer2/SDL_Renderer3: ImGui_ImplSDLRenderer2_RenderDrawData() and ImGui_ImplSDLRenderer3_RenderDrawData() now takes a SDL_Renderer* parameter. This was previously overlooked from the API but it will allow eventual support for multi-viewports.
    Extra Breaking changes IF AND ONLY IF you were using imgui_internal.h versions of Shortcut() or owner-aware versions of IsKeyPressed(), IsKeyChordPressed(), IsMouseClicked() prior to this version. (Open for details)
    Windows: BeginChild(): fixed visibility of fully clipped child windows and tables from Test Engine.
    Windows: BeginChild(): fixed auto-fit calculation when using either (not both) ResizeX/ResizeY and double-clicking on a border. Calculation incorrectly didn't always account for scrollbar as it assumed the other axis would also be auto-fit. (#1710)
    Inputs: added shortcut and routing system in public API. (#456, #2637)
        Most of the infrastructure have been in place for a few versions. Recent changes/fixes allowed to make it public.
        The general idea is that several callers may register interest in a shortcut, and only one owner gets it.
            in Parent: call Shortcut(Ctrl+S) // When Parent is focused, only Parent gets the shortcut.
            in Child1: call Shortcut(Ctrl+S) // When Child1 is focused, only Child1 gets the shortcut (Child1 overrides Parent shortcuts)
            in Child2: no call // When Child2 is focused, only Parent gets the shortcut.
        The whole system is order independent, so if Child1 makes its calls before Parent, results will be identical. This is an important property as it facilitate working with foreign code or larger codebase.
        Added Shortcut() function. e.g. Using ImGui::Shortcut(ImGuiMod_Ctrl | ImGuiKey_C) with default policy:
            checks that CTRL+C is pressed,
            and that current window is in focus stack,
            and that no other requests for CTRL+C have been made from higher priority locations (e.g. deeper in the window/item stack).
        Added SetNextItemShortcut() to set a shortcut to locally or remotely press or activate an item (depending on specified routing policy: using ImGuiInputFlags_RouteGlobal the item shortcut may be executed even if its window is not in focus stack). Items like buttons are not fully activated, in the sense that they get pressed but another active item, e.g. InputText() won't be deactivated.
        Added routing policies for Shortcut(), SetNextItemShortcut(): (#456, #2637)
            ImGuiInputFlags_RouteFocused: focus stack route (default)
            ImGuiInputFlags_RouteActive: only route to active item
            ImGuiInputFlags_RouteGlobal: route globally, unless a focus route claim shame shortcut.
            ImGuiInputFlags_RouteAlways: no routing submission, no routing check.
        Added other shortcut/routing options: (#456, #2637)
            ImGuiInputFlags_Repeat: for use by Shortcut() and by upcoming rework of various input functions (which are still internal for now).
            ImGuiInputFlags_Tooltip: for SetNextItemShortcut() to show a tooltip when hovering item.
            ImGuiInputFlags_RouteOverFocused: global route takes priority over focus route.
            ImGuiInputFlags_RouteOverActive: global route takes priority over active item.
            ImGuiInputFlags_RouteUnlessBgFocused: global route disabled if no imgui window focused.
            ImGuiInputFlags_RouteFromRootWindow: route evaluated from the point of view of root window rather than current window.
    Inputs: (OSX) Fixes variety of code which inconsistently required using Ctrl instead of Cmd.
        e.g. Drags/Sliders now use Cmd+Click to input a value. (#4084)
        Some shortcuts still uses Ctrl on Mac: e.g. Ctrl+Tab to switch windows. (#4828)
    Inputs: (OSX) Ctrl+Left Click alias as a Right click. (#2343) 
    Inputs: Fixed ImGui::GetKeyName(ImGuiKey_None) from returning "N/A" or "None" depending on value of IMGUI_DISABLE_OBSOLETE_KEYIO. It always returns "None".
    Nav: fixed holding Ctrl or gamepad L1 from not slowing down keyboard/gamepad tweak speed. Broken during a refactor refactor for 1.89. Holding Shift/R1 to speed up wasn't broken.
    Tables: fixed cell background of fully clipped row overlapping with header. (#7575, #7041) 
    Demo: Added "Inputs & Focus -> Shortcuts" section. (#456, #2637)
    Demo: Documents: Added shortcuts and renaming tabs/documents. (#7233)
    Examples: Win32+DX9,DX10,DX11,DX12: rework main loop to handle minimization and screen locking without burning resources by running unthrottled code. (#2496, #3907, #6308, #7615)
    Backends: all backends + demo now call IMGUI_CHECKVERSION() to verify ABI compatibility between caller code and compiled version of Dear ImGui. If you get an assert it most likely mean you have a build issue, read comments near the assert. (#7568)
    Backends: Win32: undo an assert introduced in 1.90.6 which didn't allow WndProc handler to be called before backend initialization. Because of how ::CreateWindow() calls in WndProc it is facilitating to not assert. (#6275) 
    Backends, Examples: SDL3: updates for latest SDL3 API changes. (#7580) 

- Changes of 1.90.6
    TreeNode: Fixed a layout inconsistency when using a empty/hidden label followed by a SameLine() call. (#7505, #282)
    With the fix, IF you were successfully using TreeNode("")+SameLine(); you will now have extra spacing between your TreeNode and the following item. You'll need to change the SameLine() call to SameLine(0,0) to remove this extraneous spacing. This seemed like the more sensible fix that's not making things less consistent. (Note: when using this idiom you are likely to also use ImGuiTreeNodeFlags_SpanAvailWidth).
    Windows: Changed default ClipRect to extend to windows' left and right borders, instead of adding arbitrary WindowPadding.x * 0.5f space on left and right. That ClipRect half-padding was arbitrary/confusing and inconsistent with Y axis. It also made it harder to draw items covering whole window without pushing an extended ClipRect. Some items near windows left and right edge that used to be clipped may be partly more visible. (#3312, #7540, #3756, #6170, #6365)
    Windows: Fixed subsequent Begin() append calls from setting last item information for title bar, making it impossible to use IsItemHovered() on a Begin()-to-append, and causing issue bypassing hover detection on collapsed windows. (#7506, #823)
    Fonts: Fixed font ascent and descent calculation when a font hits exact integer values. It is possible that some prior manual use of ImFontConfig::GlyphOffset may become duplicate with this fix. (#7399, #7404) 
    TreeNode: Added ImGuiTreeNodeFlags_SpanTextWidth to make hitbox and highlight only cover the label. (#6937) 
    Tables: Angled headers: fixed multi-line label display when angle is flipped. (#6917)
    Tables: Angled headers: added style.TableAngledHeadersTextAlign and corresponding ImGuiStyleVar_TableAngledHeadersTextAlign variable. Default to horizontal center. (#6917) 
    ProgressBar: Added support for indeterminate progress bar by passing an animated negative fraction, e.g. ProgressBar(-1.0f * GetTime()). (#5316, #5370, #1901)
    Text, DrawList: Improved handling of long single-line wrapped text. Faster and mitigate issues with reading vertex indexing limits with 16-bit indices. (#7496, #5720)
    Backends: OpenGL3: Detect ES3 contexts on desktop based on version string, to e.g. avoid calling glPolygonMode() on them. (#7447) 
    Backends: OpenGL3: Update loader for Linux to support EGL/GLVND. (#7562) 
    Backends: Vulkan: Added convenience support for Volk via IMGUI_IMPL_VULKAN_USE_VOLK define. (you could always use IMGUI_IMPL_VULKAN_NO_PROTOTYPES + ImGui_ImplVulkan_LoadFunctions() as well). (#6582, #4854) 
    Backends: SDL3: Fixed text inputs. Re-enable calling SDL_StartTextInput()/SDL_StopTextInput() as SDL3 no longer enables it by default. (#7452, #6306, #6071, #1953) 
    Examples: GLFW+Vulkan, SDL+Vulkan: Added optional support for Volk. (#6582, #4854)
    Examples: GLFW+WebGPU: Added support for WebGPU-native/Dawn (#7435, #7132) 
    Examples: GLFW+WebGPU: Renamed example_emscripten_wgpu/ to example_glfw_wgpu/. (#7435, #7132)

- Changes of 1.90.5
    More formally obsoleted GetKeyIndex() when IMGUI_DISABLE_OBSOLETE_FUNCTIONS is set.
    It has been unnecessary and a no-op since 1.87 (it returns the same value as passed when used with a 1.87+ backend using io.AddKeyEvent() function). (#4921)
    Reminder: IsKeyPressed(GetKeyIndex(ImGuiKey_XXX)) --> IsKeyPressed(ImGuiKey_XXX)
    ImDrawList: Merged the radius_x/radius_y parameters in AddEllipse(), AddEllipseFilled() and PathEllipticalArcTo() into a single ImVec2 parameter. Exceptionally, because those functions were added recently in 1.90, we are not adding inline redirection functions. The transition is easy and should affect few users. (#2743, #7417) 
    Windows: Scrollbar visibility decision uses current size when both size and contents size are submitted by API. (#7252)
    Windows: Double-click to collapse may be disabled via key-ownership mechanism. (#7369)
    Windows: BeginChild(): Extend outer resize borders to the edges when there are no corner grips. Essentially affects resizable child windows. (#7440, #1710) 
    Windows: BeginChild(): Resizing logic for child windows evaluates whether per-axis clamping should be applied based on parent scrollbars, not child scrollbars. (#7440, #1710)  Adjust those resizing limits to match window padding rather than inner clipping rectangle.
    Tables: Fixed auto-width columns when using synced-instances of same table, width of one instance would bleed into next one instead of sharing their widths. (#7218)
    Tables: Angled headers: fixed border hit box extending beyond when used within non-scrollable tables. (#7416) 
    Tables: Angled headers: fixed borders not moving back up after TableAngleHeadersRow() stops being called. (#7416) 
    Tables: Angled headers: rounding header size to nearest integers, fixes some issues when using clipper.
    Menus, Popups: Fixed an issue where sibling menu popups re-opening in successive frames would erroneously close the window. While it is technically a popup issue it would generally manifest when fast moving the mouse bottom to top in a sub-menu. (#7325, #7287, #7063)
    ProgressBar: Fixed passing fraction==NaN from leading to a crash. (#7451)
    ListBox: Fixed text-baseline offset when using SameLine()+Text() after a labeled ListBox().
    Drags, Sliders, Inputs: Fixed io.PlatformLocaleDecimalPoint decimal point localization feature not working regression from 1.90.1. (#7389, #6719, #2278) 
    Style: Added ImGuiStyleVar_TabBorderSize, ImGuiStyleVar_TableAngledHeadersAngle for consistency. (#7411) 
    DrawList: Added AddConcavePolyFilled(), PathFillConcave() concave filling. (#760)  Note that only simple polygons (no self-intersections, no holes) are supported.
    DrawList: Allow AddText() to accept null ranges. (#3615, 7391)
    Docs: added more wiki links to headers of imgui.h/imgui.cpp to facilitate discovery
    of interesting resources, because github doesn't allow Wiki to be crawled by search engines.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Mar 24 19:04:39 UTC 2024 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.90.4:
  * Nav: Fixed SetKeyboardFocusHere() or programmatic tabbing API
    from not working on windows with the
    ImGuiWindowFlags_NoNavInputs flag
    (regression in 1.90.2, which among other things broke
     imgui_memory_editor).
  * Menus, Popups: Fixed an issue where hovering a parent-menu
    upward would erroneously close the window.
  * Popups: Fixed resizable popup minimum size being too small.
    Standardized minimum size logic. (#7329).
  * Modals: Temporary changes of ImGuiCol_ModalWindowDimBg are
    properly handled by BeginPopupModal(). (#7340)
  * Tables: Angled headers: fixed support for multi-line labels.
  * Tables: Angled headers: various fixes to accurately handle
    CellPadding changes. (#6917)
  * Tables: Angled headers: properly registers horizontal
    component of angled headers for auto-resizing of columns. (#6917)
  * Tables: Angled headers: fixed TableAngledHeadersRow()
    incorrect background fill drawn too low, particularly visible
    with tables that have no scrolling. (#6917)
  * ProgressBar: Fixed a minor tesselation issue when rendering
    rounded progress bars, where in some situations the rounded
    section wouldn't follow regular tesselation rules.
  * Debug Tools: Item Picker: Promoted
    ImGui::DebugStartItemPicker() to public API. (#2673)
  * Debug Tools: Item Picker: Menu entry visible in Demo->Tools
    but greyed out unless io.ConfigDebugIsDebuggerPresent is set.
  * Misc: Added optional alpha multiplier parameter to
    GetColorU32(ImU32) variant.
  * Demo: Custom Rendering: better demonstrate PathArcTo(),
    PathBezierQuadraticCurveTo(), PathBezierCubicCurveTo(),
    PathStroke(), PathFillConvex() functions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb 19 18:51:18 UTC 2024 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.90.3:
  * Breaking changes:
    - Backends: SDL2: Removed obsolete
      ImGui_ImplSDL2_NewFrame(SDL_Window*) signature which was
      obsoleted in 1.84. Calling ImGui_ImplSDL2_NewFrame() without
      parameter is fine.
    - Backends: Vulkan: Moved RenderPass parameter from
      ImGui_ImplVulkan_Init() function to
      ImGui_ImplVulkan_InitInfo structure. Not required when using
      dynamic rendering (gh#ocornut/imgui#7308).
    - Backends: Vulkan: Using dynamic rendering now require
      filling the PipelineRenderingCreateInfo structure in
      ImGui_ImplVulkan_InitInfo, allowing to configure
      color/depth/stencil formats. Removed ColorAttachmentFormat
      field previously provided for dynamic rendering.
      (gh#ocornut/imgui#7166, gh#ocornut/imgui#6855,
      gh#ocornut/imgui#5446, gh#ocornut/imgui#5037).
  * Menus, Popups: Fixed menus and popups with ChildWindow flag
    erroneously not displaying a scrollbar when contents is over
    parent viewport size (gh#ocornut/imgui#7287,
    gh#ocornut/imgui#7063).
  * Backends
    - SDL2, SDL3: Handle gamepad disconnection + fixed increasing
      gamepad reference counter continuously.
    - Added support for multiple simultaneous gamepads. Added
      ImGui_ImplSDL2_SetGamepadMode() function to select whether
      to automatically pick first available gamepad, all gamepads,
      or specific gamepads (gh#ocornut/imgui#3884,
      gh#ocornut/imgui#6559, gh#ocornut/imgui#6890,
      gh#ocornut/imgui#7180).
    - SDL3: Fixed gamepad handling (gh#ocornut/imgui#7180).
    - SDLRenderer3: query newly added SDL_RenderViewportSet() to
      not restore a wrong viewport if none was initially set.
    - DirectX9: Using RGBA format when allowed by the driver to
      avoid CPU side conversion (gh#ocornut/imgui#6575).
  * Internals: Fixed ImFileOpen not working before context is
    created, preventing creation of a font atlas before main
    context creation (gh#ocornut/imgui#7314,
    gh#ocornut/imgui#7315).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb 14 09:06:50 UTC 2024 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.90.2:
  * Better input routing features for docked/multi-viewport based
    applications.
  * ImGuiIO::ImeWindowHandle obsoleted in 1.87 in favor of writing
    to void* ImGuiViewport::PlatformHandleRaw.
  * Backends: WebGPU: ImGui_ImplWGPU_Init() now takes a
    ImGui_ImplWGPU_InitInfo structure instead of variety of
    parameters, allowing for easier further changes
    (gh#ocornut/imgui#7240).
  * Navigation:
    - keyboard/gamepad activation mark widgets as held to give
      better visual feedback.
    - tweak to logic marking navigated item as hovered when using
      keyboard, allowing the hover highlight to stay even while
      another item is activated.
    - Fixed SetKeyboardFocusHere() not working when current nav
      focus is in different scope, regression from 1.90.1 related
      to code scoping Tab presses to local scope.
      (gh#ocornut/imgui#7226).
    - Fixed pressing Escape while in a child window with
      ImGuiWindowFlags_NavFlattened flag (gh#ocornut/imgui#7237).
    - Improve handling of Alt key to toggle menu so that key
      ownership may be claimed on individual left/right alt key
      without interfering with the other.
    - Menus: Fixed click on a BeginMenu() followed by right-arrow
      from making the child menu reopen and flicker (using
      ImGuiPopupFlags_NoReopen).
    - ImGuiWindowFlags_NoNavInputs is tested during scoring so
      NavFlattened windows can use it.
  * Popups:
    - OpenPopup(): added ImGuiPopupFlags_NoReopen flag to
      specifically not close and reopen a popup when it is already
      open (gh#ocornut/imgui#1497, gh#ocornut/imgui#1533).
    - Slight change to popup closing logic (e.g. after focusing
      another window) which skipped over popups that are also
      child windows.
  * Combo: Fixed not reusing windows optimally when used inside a
    popup stack.
  * Debug Tools:
    - Metrics: Fixed debug break in SetShortcutRouting() not
      handling ImGuiMod_Shortcut redirect.
    - Metrics: Improved Monitors and Viewports minimap display.
      Highlight on hover.
    - Debug Log: Added "Input Routing" logging.
    - Added "nop" to IM_DEBUG_BREAK macro on GCC to work around
      GDB bug (gh#ocornut/imgui#7266).
  * Backends:
    - Vulkan: Fixed vkAcquireNextImageKHR() validation errors in
      VulkanSDK 1.3.275 by allocating one extra semaphore than
      in-flight frames (gh#ocornut/imgui#7236).
    - Vulkan: Fixed vkMapMemory() calls unnecessarily using full
      buffer size (gh#ocornut/imgui#3957).
    - Vulkan: Fixed handling of
      ImGui_ImplVulkan_InitInfo::MinAllocationSize field.
      (gh#ocornut/imgui#7189, gh#ocornut/imgui#4238).
    - WebGPU: Added
      ImGui_ImplWGPU_InitInfo::PipelineMultisampleState.
      (gh#ocornut/imgui#7240).
    - WebGPU: Filling all WGPUDepthStencilState fields explicitly
      as a recent Dawn update stopped setting default values.
      (gh#ocornut/imgui#7232).
    - WebGPU: Fixed pipeline layout leak (gh#ocornut/imgui#7245).
    - OpenGL3: Backup and restore GL_PIXEL_UNPACK_BUFFER.
      (gh#ocornut/imgui#7253).
  * Internals:
    - Many improvements related to yet unpublicized shortcut
      routing and input ownership systems.
    - InputText: Added internal helpers to force reload of
      user-buffer when active (gh#ocornut/imgui#2890).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 22 10:20:29 UTC 2024 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.90.1:
  * imgui_freetype: commented out ImGuiFreeType::BuildFontAtlas()
    obsoleted in 1.81.
    Prefer using #define IMGUI_ENABLE_FREETYPE or see commented
    code for manual calls.
  * Removed CalcListClipping() marked obsolete in 1.86. (#3841)
    Prefer using ImGuiListClipper which can return non-contiguous
    ranges.
  * Internals, Columns: commented out legacy ImGuiColumnsFlags_XXX
    symbols redirecting to ImGuiOldColumnsFlags_XXX
  * Commented out obsolete ImGuiKey_KeyPadEnter redirection to
    ImGuiKey_KeypadEnter. (#2625, #7143)
  * Navigation (Keyboard/gamepad):
    - Nav, IO: SetNextFrameWantCaptureKeyboard(false) calls are
      not overridden back to true when navigation is enabled.
      SetNextFrameWantCaptureKeyboard() is always higher priority.
    - Nav: Activation can also be performed with Keypad Enter.
  * Drag and Drop:
    - Fixed drop target highlight on items temporarily pushing a
      widened clip rect (namely Selectables and Treenodes using
      SpanAllColumn flag) so the highlight properly covers
      all columns. (#7049, #4281, #3272)
  * InputText:
    - InputTextMultiline: Fixed Tab character input not repeating
    - InputTextMultiline: Tabbing through a multi-line text editor
      which allows Tab character inputs (using the
      ImGuiInputTextFlags_AllowTabInput flag) doesn't
      automatically activate it, in order to allow passing
      through multiple widgets easily.
  * Drags, Sliders, Inputs:
    + DragScalarN, SliderScalarN, InputScalarN: Fixed incorrect
      pushes into ItemWidth stack when number of components is 1.
    + Drags, Sliders, Inputs: removed all attempts to filter
      non-numerical characters during text editing. Invalid
      inputs not applied to value, visibly reverted after
      validation.
    + Drags, Sliders, Inputs: removal of filter means that "nan"
      and "inf" values may be input. (#7096)
    + DragScalarN, SliderScalarN, InputScalarN,
      PushMultiItemsWidths: improve multi-components width
      computation to better distribute the error.
  * Menus:
    + Tweaked hover slack logic, adding an extra timeout to avoid
      situations where a slow vertical movements toward another
      parent BeginMenu() can keep the wrong child menu open.
  * Color Editors:
    + ColorEdit: Layout tweaks for very small sizes. (#7120, #7121)
    + ColorPicker: Fixed saturation/value cursor radius not
      scaling properly.
  * Debug Tools:
    - Added io.ConfigDebugIsDebuggerPresent option. When enabled,
      this adds buttons in various locations of Metrics/Debugger
      to manually request a debugger break:
    - Metrics: Reorganize Tools menu.
    - Added DebugFlashStyleColor() to identify a style color.
  * Settings: Fixed an issue marking settings as dirty when merely
    clicking on a border or resize grip without moving it.
  * Misc: Added IMGUI_USER_H_FILENAME to change the path included
    when using IMGUI_INCLUDE_IMGUI_USER_H. (#7039) [@bryceberger]
  * Misc: Rework debug display of texture id in Metrics window to
    avoid compile-error when ImTextureID is defined to be larger
    than 64-bits. (#7090)
  * Misc: Added extra courtesy ==/!= operators when
    IMGUI_DEFINE_MATH_OPERATORS is defined.
  * Misc: Fixed text functions fast-path for handling "%s" and
    "%.*s" to handle null pointers gracefully, like most printf
    implementations. (#7016, #3466, #6846
  * Misc: Renamed some defines in imstb_textedit.h to avoid
    conflicts when using unity/jumbo builds on a codebase where
    another copy of the library is used.
  * Misc: During shutdown, check that io.BackendPlatformUserData
    and io.BackendRendererUserData are NULL in order to catch
    cases where backend was not shut down. (#7175)
  * Misc: Reworked Issue Template to a shinier and better form.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Nov 25 20:24:55 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.90:
  * BeginChild(): Upgraded 'bool border = false' parameter to
    'ImGuiChildFlags flags = 0'.
  * Added ImGuiChildFlags_Border value. As with our prior
    "bool-to-flags" API updates, the ImGuiChildFlags_Border
    value is guaranteed to be == true forever to ensure a
    smoother transition, meaning all existing calls will still
    work.
  * BeginChildFrame()/EndChildFrame(): removed functions in
    favor of using BeginChild() with the ImGuiChildFlags_FrameStyle
    flag.
  * IO: Removed io.MetricsActiveAllocations introduced in
    1.63, was displayed in Metrics and unlikely to
    be accessed by end-user. Value still visible in the UI and
    easily to recompute from a delta.
  * Commented out runtime support for hardcoded ~0 or
    0x01..0x0F rounding flags values for
    AddRect()/AddRectFilled()/PathRect()/AddImageRounded().

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun 27 14:57:13 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.89.6:
  * Decorated log and release notes:
    https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/releases/tag/v1.89.6
  * Breaking changes:
  * Clipper: Commented out obsolete redirection constructor which
    was marked obsolete in 1.79:
    'ImGuiListClipper(int items_count, float items_height)'
    --> Use 'ImGuiListClipper() + clipper.Begin()'.
  * Backends: SDL_Renderer: Renamed
    'imgui_impl_sdlrenderer.h/cpp' to
    'imgui_impl_sdlrenderer2.h/cpp',
    in order to accomodate for upcoming SDL3 and change in its
    SDL_Renderer API.
  * Backends: GLUT: Removed call to ImGui::NewFrame() from
    ImGui_ImplGLUT_NewFrame().
    It needs to be called from the main app loop, like with
    every other backends.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May 29 01:41:01 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.89.5:
  * InputText: Reworked prev/next-word behavior to more closely
    match Visual Studio text editor. Include '.' as a delimiter
    and alter varying subtle behavior with how
    blanks and separators are treated when skipping words.
  * InputText: Fixed a tricky edge case, ensuring value is always
    written back on the frame where IsItemDeactivated() returns
    true, in order to allow usage without user retaining
    underlying data. While we don't really want to
    encourage user not retaining underlying data, in the absence
    of a "late commit" behavior/flag we understand it may
    be desirable to take advantage of this trick.
  * Drag, Sliders: Fixed parsing of text input when '+' or '#'
    format flags are used in the format string.
  * Nav: Made Ctrl+Tab/Ctrl+Shift+Tab windowing register
    ownership to held modifier so it doesn't interfere with other
    code when remapping those actions.
  * Nav: Made PageUp/PageDown/Home/End navigation also scroll
    parent windows when necessary to make the target location
    fully visible (same as e.g. arrow keys).
  * ColorEdit: Fixed shading of S/V triangle in Hue Wheel mode.
  * TabBar: Tab-bars with ImGuiTabBarFlags_FittingPolicyScroll
    can be scrolled with horizontal mouse-wheel (or Shift + WheelY).
  * Rendering: Using adaptive tessellation for RadioButton,
    ColorEdit preview circles, Windows Close and Collapse Buttons.
  * ButtonBehavior: Fixed an edge case where changing widget
    type/behavior while active and using same id could lead to
    an assert.
  * Misc: Fixed ImVec2 operator[] violating aliasing rules
    causing issue with Intel C++ compiler. (#6272) [@BayesBug]
  * IO: Input queue trickling adjustment for touch screens.
  * Fixed tapping on BeginTabItem() on a touch-screen.
  * Fixed tapping on CollapsingHeader() with a close button
    on a touch-screen.
  * Fixed tapping on TreeNode() using
    ImGuiTreeNodeFlags_AllowItemOverlap on a touch-screen.
  * Fixed tapping on Selectable() using
    ImGuiSelectableFlags_AllowItemOverlap on a touch-screen.
  * Fixed tapping on TableHeader() on a touch-screen.
  * IO: Added io.AddMouseSourceEvent() and ImGuiMouseSource enum.
  * IO: Fixed support for calling io.AddXXXX functions from
    inactive context (wrongly advertised as supported in 1.89.4).
  * Backends: OpenGL3: Fixed GL loader crash when GL_VERSION
    returns NULL.
  * Backends: OpenGL3: Properly restoring "no shader program
    bound" if it was the case prior to running the rendering
    function.
  * Backends: Win32: Added support for io.AddMouseSourceEvent()
    to discriminate Mouse/TouchScreen/Pen.
  * Backends: SDL2/SDL3: Added support for
    io.AddMouseSourceEvent() to discriminate Mouse/TouchScreen.
  * This is relying on SDL passing SDL_TOUCH_MOUSEID in the
    event's 'which' field.
  * Backends: SDL2/SDL3: Avoid calling
    SDL_StartTextInput()/SDL_StopTextInput() as they actually
    block text input input and don't only pertain to IME.
  * Backends: GLFW: Added support on Win32 only for
    io.AddMouseSourceEvent() to discriminate Mouse/TouchScreen/Pen.
  * Backends: GLFW: Fixed key modifiers handling on secondary
    viewports.
  * Backends: Android: Added support for io.AddMouseSourceEvent()
    to discriminate Mouse/TouchScreen/Pen.
  * Backends: OSX: Added support for io.AddMouseSourceEvent() to
    discriminate Mouse/Pen.
  * Backends: WebGPU: Align buffers. Use WGSL shaders instead of
    SPIR-V. Add gamma uniform.
  * Backends: WebGPU: Reorganized to store data in
    io.BackendRendererUserData like other backends.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 13 19:42:09 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.89.4:
  * Nav: Tab key goes through every items (when keyboard navigation
    is active).
  * Nav: Enter key works to activate most items (when keyboard
    navigation is active).
  * Added return value to BeginTooltip().
  * Examples: Activated keyboard and gamepad navigation by default
    in all examples.
  * Various other fixes related to: Nav, Tables, Drag and Drop,
    InputText.
  * Various improvements to Win32, SDL2, SDL3, GLFW backends.
  * Added a Debug Tools to facilitate testing user-code testing
    Begin/BeginChild return value.
  * All changes see https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/releases/tag/v1.89.4

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 13 19:41:03 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.89.3:
  * Backends+Examples: SDL2: renamed all unnumbered references to
    "sdl" to "sdl2".
  * This is in prevision for the future release of SDL3 and its
    associated backend.
  * All changes see https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/releases/tag/v1.89.3

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan  6 08:51:21 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to v1.89.2:
  * Tables, Nav, Scrolling: fixed scrolling functions and focus tracking
    with frozen rows and frozen columns. Windows now have a better
    understanding of outer/inner decoration sizes, which should later lead
    us toward more flexible uses of menu/status bars. (#5143, #3692)
  * Tables, Nav: frozen columns are not part of menu layer and can be
    crossed over. (#5143, #3692)
  * Tables, Columns: fixed cases where empty columns may lead to empty
    ImDrawCmd. (#4857, #5937)
  * Tables: fixed matching width of synchronized tables (multiple tables
    with same id) when only some instances have a vertical scrollbar and not
    all. (#5920)
  * Fixed cases where CTRL+Tab or Modal can occasionally lead to the
    creation of ImDrawCmd with zero triangles, which would makes the render
    loop of some backends assert (e.g. Metal with debugging, Allegro).
    (#4857, #5937)
  * Inputs, IO: reworked ImGuiMod_Shortcut to redirect to Ctrl/Super at
    runtime instead of compile-time, being consistent with our support for
    io.ConfigMacOSXBehaviors and making it easier for bindings generators to
    process that value. (#5923, #456)
  * Inputs, Scrolling: better selection of scrolling window when hovering
    nested windows and when backend/OS is emitting dual-axis wheeling inputs
    (typically touch pads on macOS). We now select a primary axis based on
    recent events, and select a target window based on it. We expect this
    behavior to be further improved/tweaked. (#3795, #4559) [@ocornut,
    @folays]
  * InputText: fixed cursor navigation when pressing Up Arrow on the last
    character of a multi-line buffer which doesn't end with a carriage
    return. (#6000)
  * Text: fixed layouting of wrapped-text block when the last source line is
    above the clipping region. Regression added in 1.89. (#5720, #5919)
  * Misc: added GetItemID() in public API. It is not often expected that you
    would use this, but it is useful for Shortcut() and upcoming owner-aware
    input functions which wants to be implemented with public API.
  * Fonts: imgui_freetype: fixed a packing issue which in some occurrences
    would prevent large amount of glyphs from being packed correctly.
    (#5788, #5829)
  * Fonts: added a void* UserData field in ImFontAtlas, as a convenience for
    use by applications using multiple font atlases.
  * Demo: simplified "Inputs" section, moved contents to Metrics->Inputs.
  * Debug Tools: Metrics: added "Inputs" section, moved from Demo for
    consistency.
  * Misc: fixed parameters to IMGUI_DEBUG_LOG() not being dead-stripped when
    building with IMGUI_DISABLE_DEBUG_TOOLS is used. (#5901) [@Teselka]
  * Misc: fixed compile-time detection of SSE features on MSVC 32-bits
    builds. (#5943) [@TheMostDiligent]
  * Examples: DirectX10, DirectX11: try WARP software driver if hardware
    driver is not available. (#5924, #5562)
  * Backends: GLFW: Fixed mods state on Linux when using Alt-GR text input
    (e.g. German keyboard layout), which could lead to broken text input.
    Revert a 2022/01/17 change were we resumed using mods provided by GLFW,
    turns out they are faulty in this specific situation. (#6034)
  * Backends: Allegro5: restoring using al_draw_indexed_prim() when Allegro
    version is >= 5.2.5. (#5937) [@Espyo]
  * Backends: Vulkan: Fixed sampler passed to ImGui_ImplVulkan_AddTexture()
    not being honored as we were using an immutable sampler. (#5502, #6001,
    #914) [@martin-ejdestig, @rytisss]
