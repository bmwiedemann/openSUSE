- update to 1.89.5:
  * InputText: Reworked prev/next-word behavior to more closely
    match Visual Studio text editor. Include '.' as a delimiter
    and alter varying subtle behavior with how
    blanks and separators are treated when skipping words.
  * InputText: Fixed a tricky edge case, ensuring value is always
    written back on the frame where IsItemDeactivated() returns
    true, in order to allow usage without user retaining
    underlying data. While we don't really want to
    encourage user not retaining underlying data, in the absence
    of a "late commit" behavior/flag we understand it may
    be desirable to take advantage of this trick.
  * Drag, Sliders: Fixed parsing of text input when '+' or '#'
    format flags are used in the format string.
  * Nav: Made Ctrl+Tab/Ctrl+Shift+Tab windowing register
    ownership to held modifier so it doesn't interfere with other
    code when remapping those actions.
  * Nav: Made PageUp/PageDown/Home/End navigation also scroll
    parent windows when necessary to make the target location
    fully visible (same as e.g. arrow keys).
  * ColorEdit: Fixed shading of S/V triangle in Hue Wheel mode.
  * TabBar: Tab-bars with ImGuiTabBarFlags_FittingPolicyScroll
    can be scrolled with horizontal mouse-wheel (or Shift + WheelY).
  * Rendering: Using adaptive tessellation for RadioButton,
    ColorEdit preview circles, Windows Close and Collapse Buttons.
  * ButtonBehavior: Fixed an edge case where changing widget
    type/behavior while active and using same id could lead to
    an assert.
  * Misc: Fixed ImVec2 operator[] violating aliasing rules
    causing issue with Intel C++ compiler. (#6272) [@BayesBug]
  * IO: Input queue trickling adjustment for touch screens.
  * Fixed tapping on BeginTabItem() on a touch-screen.
  * Fixed tapping on CollapsingHeader() with a close button
    on a touch-screen.
  * Fixed tapping on TreeNode() using
    ImGuiTreeNodeFlags_AllowItemOverlap on a touch-screen.
  * Fixed tapping on Selectable() using
    ImGuiSelectableFlags_AllowItemOverlap on a touch-screen.
  * Fixed tapping on TableHeader() on a touch-screen.
  * IO: Added io.AddMouseSourceEvent() and ImGuiMouseSource enum.
  * IO: Fixed support for calling io.AddXXXX functions from
    inactive context (wrongly advertised as supported in 1.89.4).
  * Backends: OpenGL3: Fixed GL loader crash when GL_VERSION
    returns NULL.
  * Backends: OpenGL3: Properly restoring "no shader program
    bound" if it was the case prior to running the rendering
    function.
  * Backends: Win32: Added support for io.AddMouseSourceEvent()
    to discriminate Mouse/TouchScreen/Pen.
  * Backends: SDL2/SDL3: Added support for
    io.AddMouseSourceEvent() to discriminate Mouse/TouchScreen.
  * This is relying on SDL passing SDL_TOUCH_MOUSEID in the
    event's 'which' field.
  * Backends: SDL2/SDL3: Avoid calling
    SDL_StartTextInput()/SDL_StopTextInput() as they actually
    block text input input and don't only pertain to IME.
  * Backends: GLFW: Added support on Win32 only for
    io.AddMouseSourceEvent() to discriminate Mouse/TouchScreen/Pen.
  * Backends: GLFW: Fixed key modifiers handling on secondary
    viewports.
  * Backends: Android: Added support for io.AddMouseSourceEvent()
    to discriminate Mouse/TouchScreen/Pen.
  * Backends: OSX: Added support for io.AddMouseSourceEvent() to
    discriminate Mouse/Pen.
  * Backends: WebGPU: Align buffers. Use WGSL shaders instead of
    SPIR-V. Add gamma uniform.
  * Backends: WebGPU: Reorganized to store data in
    io.BackendRendererUserData like other backends.

- update to 1.89.4:
  * Nav: Tab key goes through every items (when keyboard navigation
    is active).
  * Nav: Enter key works to activate most items (when keyboard
    navigation is active).
  * Added return value to BeginTooltip().
  * Examples: Activated keyboard and gamepad navigation by default
    in all examples.
  * Various other fixes related to: Nav, Tables, Drag and Drop,
    InputText.
  * Various improvements to Win32, SDL2, SDL3, GLFW backends.
  * Added a Debug Tools to facilitate testing user-code testing
    Begin/BeginChild return value.
  * All changes see https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/releases/tag/v1.89.4

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 13 19:41:03 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.89.3:
  * Backends+Examples: SDL2: renamed all unnumbered references to
    "sdl" to "sdl2".
  * This is in prevision for the future release of SDL3 and its
    associated backend.
  * All changes see https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/releases/tag/v1.89.3

Fri Jan  6 08:51:21 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to v1.89.2:
  * Tables, Nav, Scrolling: fixed scrolling functions and focus tracking
    with frozen rows and frozen columns. Windows now have a better
    understanding of outer/inner decoration sizes, which should later lead
    us toward more flexible uses of menu/status bars. (#5143, #3692)
  * Tables, Nav: frozen columns are not part of menu layer and can be
    crossed over. (#5143, #3692)
  * Tables, Columns: fixed cases where empty columns may lead to empty
    ImDrawCmd. (#4857, #5937)
  * Tables: fixed matching width of synchronized tables (multiple tables
    with same id) when only some instances have a vertical scrollbar and not
    all. (#5920)
  * Fixed cases where CTRL+Tab or Modal can occasionally lead to the
    creation of ImDrawCmd with zero triangles, which would makes the render
    loop of some backends assert (e.g. Metal with debugging, Allegro).
    (#4857, #5937)
  * Inputs, IO: reworked ImGuiMod_Shortcut to redirect to Ctrl/Super at
    runtime instead of compile-time, being consistent with our support for
    io.ConfigMacOSXBehaviors and making it easier for bindings generators to
    process that value. (#5923, #456)
  * Inputs, Scrolling: better selection of scrolling window when hovering
    nested windows and when backend/OS is emitting dual-axis wheeling inputs
    (typically touch pads on macOS). We now select a primary axis based on
    recent events, and select a target window based on it. We expect this
    behavior to be further improved/tweaked. (#3795, #4559) [@ocornut,
    @folays]
  * InputText: fixed cursor navigation when pressing Up Arrow on the last
    character of a multi-line buffer which doesn't end with a carriage
    return. (#6000)
  * Text: fixed layouting of wrapped-text block when the last source line is
    above the clipping region. Regression added in 1.89. (#5720, #5919)
  * Misc: added GetItemID() in public API. It is not often expected that you
    would use this, but it is useful for Shortcut() and upcoming owner-aware
    input functions which wants to be implemented with public API.
  * Fonts: imgui_freetype: fixed a packing issue which in some occurrences
    would prevent large amount of glyphs from being packed correctly.
    (#5788, #5829)
  * Fonts: added a void* UserData field in ImFontAtlas, as a convenience for
    use by applications using multiple font atlases.
  * Demo: simplified "Inputs" section, moved contents to Metrics->Inputs.
  * Debug Tools: Metrics: added "Inputs" section, moved from Demo for
    consistency.
  * Misc: fixed parameters to IMGUI_DEBUG_LOG() not being dead-stripped when
    building with IMGUI_DISABLE_DEBUG_TOOLS is used. (#5901) [@Teselka]
  * Misc: fixed compile-time detection of SSE features on MSVC 32-bits
    builds. (#5943) [@TheMostDiligent]
  * Examples: DirectX10, DirectX11: try WARP software driver if hardware
    driver is not available. (#5924, #5562)
  * Backends: GLFW: Fixed mods state on Linux when using Alt-GR text input
    (e.g. German keyboard layout), which could lead to broken text input.
    Revert a 2022/01/17 change were we resumed using mods provided by GLFW,
    turns out they are faulty in this specific situation. (#6034)
  * Backends: Allegro5: restoring using al_draw_indexed_prim() when Allegro
    version is >= 5.2.5. (#5937) [@Espyo]
  * Backends: Vulkan: Fixed sampler passed to ImGui_ImplVulkan_AddTexture()
    not being honored as we were using an immutable sampler. (#5502, #6001,
    #914) [@martin-ejdestig, @rytisss]
