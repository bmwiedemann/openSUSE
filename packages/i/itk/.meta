  <title>Object Oriented Extension for Tcl</title>
  <description>Incr Tcl adds object-oriented programming facilities to Tcl.  It was
NOT designed as another whiz-bang, object-oriented programming
language. It is patterned somewhat after C++.  It was designed to
support more structured programming in Tcl.  Scripts that grow beyond a
few thousand lines become extremely difficult to maintain. [incr Tcl]
attacks this problem in the same way that any object- oriented
programming language would, by providing mechanisms for data
encapsulation behind well-defined interfaces.</description>
