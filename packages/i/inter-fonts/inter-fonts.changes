- Update to 4.0:
  * This is a grand new release, with over two years of work behind
    it. A lot has changed since version 3.x. Thousands of glyphs
    have been redesigned. Here are some highlights, compared to the
    previous version:
    = Six additional "Display" designs, assigned to an opsz
      variable-font axis, exposed as a second family "Inter
      Display" as static fonts.
    = Several new OpenType features
    = Humanist-style italics
    = Many technical changes (UPM changed to 2048, refined metrics,
      many improved features, etc)
- Create the inter-variable-fonts subpackage
- Remove the _service file
