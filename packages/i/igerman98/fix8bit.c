/*
 * This is a stupid little program that can be used to convert 8-bit
 * characters to and from backslashed escape sequences.  It is usually
 * more efficient to do this to affix files than to uuencode them for
 * transport.  Ispell will read affix files in either format, so it is
 * merely personal preference as to which form to use.
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 *	fix8bit {-7 | -8} < infile > outfile
 *
 * One of -7 and -8 must be specified.  If -7 is given, any character
 * sequence that is not standard printable ASCII will be converted
 * into a backslashed octal sequence.  If -8 is given, any backslashed
 * octal or hex sequence will be converted into the equivalent 8-bit
 * character.
 *
 * This program is not very smart.  In particular, it makes no attempt
 * to understand comments, quoted strings, or similar constructs in
 * which you might not want conversion to take place.  I suggest that
 * you "diff" the input against the output, and if you don't like the
 * result, correct it by hand.
