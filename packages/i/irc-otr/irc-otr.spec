%description
This package provides modules which implement Off-The-Record (OTR) Messaging
protocol for a number of popular IRC clients.

OTR allows you to have private conversations over IM by providing:

 - Encryption
   - No one else can read your instant messages.
 - Authentication
   - You are assured the correspondent is who you think it is.
 - Deniability
   - The messages you send do _not_ have digital signatures that are
     checkable by a third party.  Anyone can forge messages after a
     conversation to make them look like they came from you.  However,
     _during_ a conversation, your correspondent is assured the messages
     he sees are authentic and unmodified.
 - Perfect forward secrecy
   - If you lose control of your private keys, no previous conversation
     is compromised.

%description -n	irssi-otr
This plugin adds Off-the-Record messaging support for the irssi IRC client.
Although primarily designed for use with the bitlbee IRC2IM gateway, it
works within any query window, provided that the conversation partner's IRC
client supports OTR.

OTR allows you to have private conversations over IM by providing:

 - Encryption
   - No one else can read your instant messages.
 - Authentication
   - You are assured the correspondent is who you think it is.
 - Deniability
   - The messages you send do _not_ have digital signatures that are
     checkable by a third party.  Anyone can forge messages after a
     conversation to make them look like they came from you.  However,
     _during_ a conversation, your correspondent is assured the messages
     he sees are authentic and unmodified.
 - Perfect forward secrecy
   - If you lose control of your private keys, no previous conversation
     is compromised.
