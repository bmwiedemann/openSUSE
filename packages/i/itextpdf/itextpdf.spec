%description
iText is a library that allows you to generate PDF files on the fly.
The iText classes are very useful for people who need to generate
read-only, platform independent documents containing text, lists,
tables and images. The library is especially useful in combination with
Java(TM) technology-based Servlets: The look and feel of HTML is
browser dependent; with iText and PDF you can control exactly how your
servlet's output will look.
