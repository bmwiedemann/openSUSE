  <title>IccXML library</title>
  <description>IccLibXML library acts as an extension of SampleICC's IccProfLib.
This extension provides Inherited classes for the classes in IccProfLib
that provide additional I/O routines to read and write the classes as
XML files.  As such, it provides the means of converting ICC profiles
into and out of an XML format (hereafter referred to as icc.XML).
Documentation for the schema for the icc.XML in the library can be
found as part the ICCXML project distribution.   IccLibXML also uses
libxml2 for the purposes of parsing XML files.</description>
