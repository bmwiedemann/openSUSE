- Update ibus-skk.spec to get rid of update-desktop-files:
  * It often duplicates upstream translation effort, wasting a human
    work, both community translators and contracted ones.
  * Most of these translations are ~20 years old, and they were never
    reviewed, so it is possible that they are worse than the upstream
    ones. In the last 20 years it did not provide any way to upstream
    the changes and translations. The upstream translations got another
    20 years of development. Also Desktop Categories specification was
    updated, and the upstream specification now covers all aspects of
    former X-SuSE-* Categories extensions.
  * As a result, the SUSE desktop menu experience differs from other
    vendors. Applications have a different name, different translations,
    different placement in the structured menu etc.
  * Upstream translations have a wider impact.
  * Package maintainers have only a limited control over the contents
    visible to users. It is imported during the runtime, and the visible
    contents could be different from the contents in the package.
  * update-desktop-files is a complicated tool. It attempts to fix
    deprecated and obsolete stuff in the desktop files without even
    informing the developer that something was wrong and something was
    modified.
  * It uses a very complicated toolchain that requires access to SUSE
    intranet and access to OpenQA VPN. The complete toolchain setup was
    never published, so it has even problems with Open Source ideas.
  * It mixes SUSE-unique translations with translations that just
    duplicate the upstream translation effort. As a result it significantly
    increases number of strings to translate and decreases the quality of
    the translation.
