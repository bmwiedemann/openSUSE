- Update to v0.8.0
  * Extended compatibility with Quake 2021 re-release:
    - Steam API support (when using an auto-detected Steam installation):
      achievements, time tracking, rich presence, screenshots
    - support for remastered models (using code from QSS, by @Shpoike)
  * Added -prefremaster/-remaster and -preforiginal/-original command-line
    arguments (thanks to @KurtLoeffler)
  * Improved controller support:
    - gyro aim (thanks to @sndein), flick stick, rumble
    - new Gamepad Options menu
    - new dedicated tab in Controls menu
  * Demo playback controls
  * Extended console capabilities:
    - select and copy text to clipboard
    - clickable links to show saved screenshots/demos/savefiles/config files
      in Explorer
    - TAB completion hints
  * Extended memory allocator to support huge maps such as Immortal Lock
    without needing -heapsize on the command line
  * CPU and GPU performance improvements
  * Autosave enhancements:
    - improved heuristics (e.g. for Copper's func_void)
    - less intrusive notifications
    - ability to resume autosave when selecting a map in the Levels menu
  * Redesigned Options menu: live previews, more options exposed
  * Added QuakeWorld HUD layout (thanks to @bangstk)
  * Added speed indicator (thanks to @andrey-budko)
  * Music is now continued when reloading a map
  * From QS: enabled support for tracker music
  * Mapping enhancements:
    - added basic map checks when started from a level editing tool
      (TrenchBroom/JACK/ne_q1spCompilingGui/q1compile); can disabled by passing
       -nomapchecks, or enabled manually by setting map_checks cvar to 1 before
       loading a map
    - ‚ùó Note: gl_zfix and advanced transparency options are disabled when map
      checks are active in order to avoid compatibility issues with QS.
    - added r_showfields cvar to display field values for the entity under the crosshair
    - extended r_showbboxes functionality to highlight entities linking to/linked
      from the entity under the crosshair and display entity numbers and classnames
    - added support for entity numbers in addition to classnames for r_showbboxes_filter,
      e.g. r_showbboxes_filter #42 (thanks to @andrey-budko)
    - added skywind_lookdir [period] [intensity] command to simplify skywind setup
    - changed viewpos output to show player position, camera position, and corresponding sun mangle
    - changed setpos command to accept viewpos command output directly (no need to strip parentheses)
  * ... and more !
