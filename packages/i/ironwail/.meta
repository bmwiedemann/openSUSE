  <description>A fork of the popular GLQuake descendant QuakeSpasm with a focus on high performance instead of maximum compatibility, with a few extra features sprinkled on top.

Quake game files (id1 directory containing pak files) must be found for ironquake to start:

- automatically found if the Quake Steam remaster is installed
- id1 directory can be copied into ~/.ironwail
- start ironwail with option -basedir &lt;install_dir&gt;, where &lt;install_dir&gt; is the directory containing the id1 folder
