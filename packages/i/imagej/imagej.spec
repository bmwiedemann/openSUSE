%description
ImageJ is a multithreaded image processing program inspired by NIH
Image for the Macintosh, running either as an applet or as a
standalone program.

It can read many image formats including TIFF, GIF, JPEG, BMP, DICOM,
FITS and "raw", and display, edit, anazlye, process and print
8/16/32-bit images. It supports "stacks", a series of images that
share a single window. It can calculate area and pixel value
statistics of user-defined selections, measure distances and angles,
create density histograms and line profile plots, supports standard
image processing functions such as contrast manipulation, sharpening,
smoothing, edge detection and median filtering. It does geometric
transformations such as scaling, rotation and flips. Zoom in/out up
to 32:1/1:32. Spatial calibration is available to provide real-world
dimensional measurements in units such as millimeters. Density or
gray scale calibration is also available.

ImageJ can be extended via Java plugins, and has a built-in editor and
compiler.
