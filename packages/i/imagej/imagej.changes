    inside a selection.

    Edit>Selection>Properties dialog.

    and the "Overlay only" checkbox is only shown in the Translate 
    dialog when there is an overlay.

    images, empties the ROI Manager, clears the Results table and
    enables the "Black background" option.
  * The Reslice command is faster on Windows when re-slicing from 
    "Left" or "Right" and it uses an ordinary progress bar when

    File>Import>Image Sequence dialog.

    picker tool popup menu.

    Math.toDegrees(radians) functions.
  * Added the ResultsTable.addRow() method. For an example, run 
    Help>Examples>JavaScript>Sine/Cosine Table.

    method to sometimes not work as expected.

    format.

    in HIstogram windows to sometimes not be displayed correctly.

    shortcut on Windows, when used on a stack, to not display the 
    "Proces Stack?" dialog.
  * Fixed a 1.53e regression that caused the imageCaculator() macro
    function do somethimes not work as expected.

    to output incorrect Results tables.

    command in the text editor to fail.
  * Fixed a 1.53c regression in the AVI Reader that caused it to 
    throw a null pointer exception.

  * Added the Image>Stacks>Statistics command.
  * Thanks to Michael Schmid, the built in brush, pencil and overlay brush tools draw using the background color when alt key is down, are constrained to draw horizontally when shift is down, are resized when shift&control are down (shift&cmd on Macs), and "pick up" the foreground color when control is down (cmd on Macs).
  * Added a "16 bit range" choice to the Edit>Options>Appearance dialog box. This is the same as the "Unsigned 16 bit range" choice in the Brightness/Contast Adjuster's "Set" dialog.

  1.47a 17 July 2012
  * Thanks to Thomas Boudier, added five new 3D filters (Median, Mean, Minimum, Maximum and Variance) to the Process>Filters submenu.

    Image>Overlay>Overlay Options and ROI ManagerProperties dialogs 
    to have selections drawn using a width of one pixel 
    regardless of the image magnification.
  * Fixed a bug that could cause selections being moved to not be 
    displayed correctly when the "Use ROI names as labels" option in 
    the ROI Manager was enabled.
  * Fixed a bug that caused Analyze>Plot Profile to fail with line 
    selections with widths less than 1.0.

    all channels instead of only the current channel.
  * Tiago Ferreira fixed a bug that caused stacks binned with 
    Image>Stacks>Tools>GroupedZProjector to loose spatial calibration.
  * Thanks to Burri Olivier, fixed a bug that caused incorrect auto stack 
    thresholds when "Limit to threshold was enabled in Analyze>Set Measurements.
