- Add n_libva-2.0-ABI-header-fix.patch: Load libva-x11.so.2 for
  libva-2.0 ABI version. This is a reworked patch from an upstream
  merge request. Patch in it's current form is not upstreamable,
  but works for us since we only have libva-2.0 to care about.
  See https://github.com/01org/intel-hybrid-driver/pull/26 for more
  context.
