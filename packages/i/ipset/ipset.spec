%description
IP sets are a framework inside the Linux kernel, which can be
administered by the ipset utility. Depending on the type, currently
an IP set may store IP addresses, (TCP/UDP) port numbers or IP
addresses with MAC addresses in a way, which ensures lightning speed
when matching an entry against a set.

ipset can:
* store multiple IP addresses or port numbers and match against the
  collection by iptables in one swoop;
* dynamically update iptables rules against IP addresses or ports
  without performance penalty;
* express complex IP address and ports based rulesets with one single
  iptables rule and benefit from the speed of IP sets
