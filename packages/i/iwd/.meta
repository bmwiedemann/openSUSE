  <title>Wireless daemon for Linux</title>
  <description>The iNet Wireless Daemon (iwd) project aims to provide a comprehensive wireless connectivity solution for Linux based devices.
The core goal of the project is to optimise resource utilisation: storage, runtime memory and link-time costs.

This is accomplished by not depending on any external libraries and utilising features provided by the Linux Kernel to the maximum extent possible.</description>
