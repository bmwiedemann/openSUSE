  Breaking changes (PLEASE READ!)
  You can no longer specify a different ORDER BY clause in a subquery than the one in the top 
  level query. This functionality never worked properly, but was not explicitly forbidden.
  As part of the ongoing development of the tsi1 index, the implementation of a Bloom Filter, 
  used to efficiently determine if series are not present in the index, was altered in #8857. 
  While this significantly increases the performance of the index and reduces its memory 
  consumption, the existing tsi1 indexes created while running previous versions of the database 
  are not compatible with 1.4.0.
  Users with databases using the tsi1 index must go through the following process to upgrade to 
  1.4.0:
  1 Stop influxd.
  2 Remove all index directories on databases using the tsi1 index. 
    With default configuration these can be found in 
    /var/lib/influxdb/data/DB_NAME/RP_NAME/SHARD_ID/index or
    ~/.influxdb/data/DB_NAME/RP_NAME/SHARD_ID/index.
    It's worth noting at this point how many different shard_ids you visit.
  3 Run the influx_inspect inmem2tsi tool using the shard's data and WAL
    directories for -datadir and -waldir, respectively. Given the example
    in step (2) that would be influx_inspect inmem2tsi -datadir
    /var/lib/influxdb/data/DB_NAME/RP_NAME/SHARD_ID
    -waldir /path/to/influxdb/wal/DB_NAME/RP_NAME/SHARD_ID.
  4 Repeat step (3) for each shard that needs to be converted.
    Start influxd.
  Users with existing tsi1 shards, who attempt to start version 1.4.0 without following the 
  above steps, will find the shards refuse to open, and will most likely see the following 
  error message:
     incompatible tsi1 index MANIFEST
     Configuration Changes
  [collectd] Section
  parse-multivalue-plugin was added with a default of split. When set to split, multivalue 
  plugin data (e.g. df free:5000,used:1000) will be split into separate measurements (e.g., 
  (df_free, value=5000) (df_used, value=1000)). When set to join, multivalue plugin will be 
  stored as a single multi-value measurement (e.g., (df, free=5000,used=1000)).
  * Fix panic: runtime error: slice bounds out of range

    is from an OSS or Enterprise service.

    be handled by the collectd service.
