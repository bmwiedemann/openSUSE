%description
i3status is a program for generating a status bar for i3bar, dzen2,
xmobar or similar programs. It issues a small number of system
calls, as one generally wants to update such status lines every
second so that the bar is updated even under load. It saves a bit of
energy by being more efficient than shell commands.
