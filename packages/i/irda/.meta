  <title>Necessary Tools for Using the Infrared Port</title>
  <description>This package contains all necessary scripts and programs for setting up
and using the infrared port for printing or communicating. The start
and stop scripts are prepared to access the UART emulation ('SIR' mode)
with 115 kbit/s data transfer rate. This is supported by most laptops
with an infrared interface.

After starting the infrared protocol manager 'irmanger' with the
command 'rcirda start', you can send data to your printer using the
device file /dev/irlpt0. If you like to talk to other computers with
infrared interface or to a mobile phone, you can use the serial
emulation provided by the device file /dev/ircomm0.

Take a look at the README file located in
/usr/share/doc/packages/irda/README and the IRDA HOWTO in
/usr/share/doc/howto/en/IR-HOWTO.gz. If the infrared port on your
laptop is located on an IO or IRQ address other than IO address 0x2f8
(/dev/ttyS1) or interrupt 3, you should use YaST to change the
variables IRDA_PORT and IRDA_IRQ in the configuration file
/etc/rc.config.</description>
