  <title>Daemon Activating Network Interfaces on Cable Plug</title>
  <description>ifplugd is a lightweight Linux daemon that configures the network
automatically when a cable is plugged in and unconfigures it when the
cable is pulled. It is primarily intended for use with laptops. It
relies on the distribution's native network configuration subsystem, so
is not very intrusive.</description>
