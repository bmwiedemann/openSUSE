    <comment>- update to 2.6.3
  You can find issues related to this release on our Roadmap.
  * PHP 7.3
    - Now supported. tada
  * LDAP - Community contributions, that's the spirit
    With the help of our users we've finally fixed the issue that 
    defining multiple hostnames and enabling STARTTLS has never 
    properly worked. Also, they've identified that defining 
    multiple hostnames caused a customized port not being utilized 
    and fixed it themselves.
    There has also a rare case been fixed that caused no group 
    members being found in case object classes had a different
    casing than what we expected. (Good news for all the 
    non-OpenLdap and non-MSActiveDirectory users)
    - LDAP connection fails with multiple servers using STARTTLS 
      #3639
    - LDAPS authentication ignores custom port setting #3713
    - LDAP group members not found #3650
  * We take care about your data even better now
    With this are newlines and HTML entities (such as &amp;nbsp;) in 
    plugin output and custom variables meant.
    Sorry if I've teased some data security folks now. innocent
    - Newlines in plugin output disappear #3662
    - Windows path separators are converted to newlines in custom 
      variables #3636
    - HTML entities in plugin output are not resolved if no other 
      HTML is there #3707
  * You've wondered how you got into a famous blue police box?
    Don't worry, not only you and the european union are sometimes
    unsure what's the correct time.
    - Set client timezone on DB connection #3525
    - Ensure a valid default timezone is set in any case #3747
    - Fix that the event detail view is not showing times in 
      correct timezone #3660
  * UI - The portal to your monitoring environment, improved
    The collapsible sidebar introduced with v2.5 has been plagued 
    by some issues since then. They're now fixed. Also, the UI 
    should now flicker less and properly preserve the scroll 
    position when interacting with action links. (This also allows
    the business process module to behave more stable when using 
    drag and drop in large configurations.)
    - Collapsible Sidebar Issues #3187
    - Fix title when closing right column #3654
    - Preserve scroll position upon form submits #3661
  * Corrected things we've broke recently
    That's due to preemptive changes to protect you from bad 
    individuals. Unfortunately this meant that some unforeseen
    side-effects appeared after the release of v2.6.2. 
    These are now fixed.
    - Multiline values in ini files broken #3705
    - PHP ini parser doesn't strip trailing whitespace #3733
    - Escaped characters in INI values are not unescaped #3648
    - Though, if you've faced issue #3705 you still need to take 
      manual action (if not already done) as the provided fix does 
      only prevent further occurrences of the resulting error. The
      required changes involve the transformation of all real 
      newlines in Icinga Web 2's INI files to literal \n or \r\n
      sequences. (Files likely having such are the roles.ini and 
      announcements.ini)
