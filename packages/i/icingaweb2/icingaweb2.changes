Sat Aug 22 15:00:54 UTC 2020 - ecsos <ecsos@opensuse.org>

- Update to 2.8.2
  
  Notice: This is a security release. 
          It is recommended to immediately upgrade to this release.

  You can find all issues related to this release on the respective 
  milestone.

  * Path Traversal Vulnerability
    The vulnerability in question allows an attacker to access 
    arbitrary files which are readable by the process running 
    Icinga Web 2. Technical details can be found at the 
    corresponding CVE-2020-24368 and in the issue below.

    - Possible path traversal when serving static image files #4226

  * Broken Negated Filters with PostgreSQL
    We've also included a small non-security related fix. Searching
    for e.g. servicegroup!=support leads to an error instead of the
    desired result when using a PostgreSQL database.

    - Single negated membership filter fails with PostgreSQL #4196

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun 29 12:39:00 UTC 2020 - ecsos <ecsos@opensuse.org>

- Update to 2.8.1
  * Case Sensitivity Problems
    A fix in v2.8.0 led to users being not able to login if they
    got their username's case wrong. A hostgroup name's case has
    also been incorrectly taken into account despite using a CI 
    labelled column in the servicegrid and other lists.
    - Login usernames now case sensitive in 2.8 #4184
    - Case insensitive hostgroup filter in service grid not working
      #4178
  * Issues With Numbers
    An attempt to avoid misrepresenting environments in the 
    tactical overview had an opposite effect by showing negative
    numbers. Filtering for timestamps in the event history also 
    showed no results because our filters couldn't cope with plain
    numbers anymore.
    - Tactical overview showing "-1 pending" hosts #4174
    - Timestamp filters not working correctly in history views
      #4182

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun  8 13:22:08 UTC 2020 - ecsos <ecsos@opensuse.org>

- Update to 2.8.0
  * Icinga DB
    It's happening. Yes. Our latest achievement is now available
    for those who are willing to participate in this enormous
    endeavour. Icinga Web 2 is also a crucial part of it and 
    accompanies the first release of Icinga DB. If you like to 
    participate, don't forget to update Icinga Web 2 as well.
  * Support for PHP 7.4 and MySQL 8
    We also made sure that you won't be disappointed by Icinga Web 2
    if you're running PHP 7.4 or trying to access a MySQL database
    with version 8+. These should pose no issues anymore now. But
    if you still somehow managed to get issues please let us now 
    and we'll fix it asap.
    - Exceptions with MySQL 8 #3740
    - Support for PHP 7.4 #4009
  * Find What You Search For
    It's been previously not possible to properly filter for range
    values. This was especially true for custom variables where, 
    if you searched for e.g. _host_interfaces>=20, you wouldn't 
    find the correct results. If you often copy some values in our 
    search fields you may also been a victim of extraneous spaces
    which are now automatically trimmed.
    - Filter: more/less than doesn't seem to working #3974
    - Search object followed by a space finds no results #4002
  * Don't Leave Your Little Sheep Unattended
    It's time again to further restrict your users. It's now 
    possible to completely block any access to contacts and 
    contactgroups for specific roles. These won't ever see again
    who's notified and who's not. Also, if you are using single
    accounts for a group of people you can now disable password
    changes for those.
    - Prohibit access to contacts and contactgroups #3973
    - Allow to forbid password changes on specific user accounts #3286
  * In and Out, Access Control Done Right
    While we have no burgers but cookies you are nevertheless
    welcome to visit Icinga Web 2. And now you can also successfully
    leave while being externally authenticated and unsuccessfully
    enter while being unable to not add extraneous spaces to your
    username.
    - External logout not working from the navigation dashboard #3995
    - Username with extraneous spaces are not invalid #4030

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May 22 16:58:45 UTC 2020 - Lars Vogdt <lars@linux-schulserver.de>

- update to 2.8.0~rc1
  * fixed exceptions with MySQL 8 #3740

Fri Oct 18 09:02:43 UTC 2019 - ecsos@opensuse.org

- Update to 2.7.3
  This is a hotfix release and fixes the following issue:
  - Servicegroups for roles with filtered objects not available #3983

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct 16 08:22:14 UTC 2019 - ecsos@opensuse.org

- Update to 2.7.2
  You can find all issues related to this release on our Roadmap.
  * Less Smoky Database Servers
    The release of v2.7.1 introduced a change which revealed an 
    inefficient part of our database queries. We made some general 
    optimizations on our queries and changed the way we utilize 
    them in some views. The result are faster response times by 
    less work for the database server.
    - Consuming more CPU resources since upgraded to 2.7.1 #3928
  * Anarchism Infested Dashboards
    Recent history already showed signs of anarchism. (Pun intended) 
    A similar mindset now infested default dashboards which appeared
    in a different way than before v2.7.0. We taught their dashlets
    a lesson and order has been reestablished as previously.
    - Recently Recovered Services in dashboard Current Incidents
      seems out of order #3931
  * Solitary Downtimes
    We improved the host and service distinction with v2.7.0. The 
    downtimes list however got confused by this and didn't knew 
    anymore how to combine multiple downtimes. If you now instruct
    the list to select multiple downtimes this works again as we 
    removed the confusing parts.
    - Selection of multiple downtimes fails #3920

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Aug 24 16:21:55 UTC 2019 - ecsos@opensuse.org

- Update to 2.7.1
  You can find all issues related to this release on our Roadmap.
  * Sneaky Solution for Sneaky Links
    Usually we try to include only bugs in minor-releases. Sorry, 
    bug-fixes, of course. But thanks to @winem_ we have also a 
    little enhancement this time: Links in comments, notes, etc. 
    are now highlighted as such.
    - Highlight links in the notes of an object #3888
  * Nobody's Perfect, Not Even Developers
    We knew it. We saw it coming. And forgot about it. Some views, 
    especially histories, showed an anarchic behavior since v2.7.0.
    The change responsible for this has been undone and history's 
    order is reestablished now.
    - Default sort rules no longer work in 2.7.0 #3891
  * Restrictions Gone Wild Cagey
    A fix unfortunately caused restrictions using wildcards to show
    no results anymore. This is now solved and such restrictions 
    are as permissive as ever.
    - Wildcard filters in chains broken #3886

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul 30 22:31:29 UTC 2019 - ecsos@opensuse.org

- Update to 2.7.0
  You can find issues related to this release on our Roadmap.
  * Icinga's Amazingness Spreads Further
    All the Japanese and Ukrainian monitoring enthusiasts can now 
    appreciate our web-frontend in their native tongue. Being so 
    late to the party is also of their advantage, though. Because 
    they can adjust their dashboard without worrying it gets broke 
    with the next update. (All other admins with non-english users,
    please have a look at our upgrading documentation)
    - Add Japanese language support #3776
    - Add Ukrainian language support #3828
    - Don't translate pane and dashlet names in configs #3837
  * Modules - Bonus Functionality Unleashed
    With this release module developers got additional ways to 
    customize Icinga Web 2. Whether you ever wanted to hook into 
    a configuration form's handling, to perform your very own Ajax
    requests or enhance our multi-select views with fancy graphs. 
    All is possible now.
    - Allow to hook into a configuration form's handling #3862
    - Allow to fully customize click and submit handling #3794
    - Integrate DetailviewExtension into multi-select views #3304
  * UI - Your Daily Routine and Incident Management, Enhanced
    Users with color deficiencies now have a built-in theme to ease
    navigating within Icinga Web 2. Also, our forms got a long 
    overdue re-design and now look less boring. Though, the best of
    all features is that clicking while holding the Ctrl-key now 
    actually opens a new browser tab! Lost comments? No more. 
    Defining an expiry date again? No more!
    - Add colorblind theme #3743
    - Improve the look of forms #3416
    - Make ctrl-click open new tab #3723
  * Stay Focused - More Room for More Important Stuff
    Some of you know that some checks tend to produce walls of text
    or measure (too) many interfaces. Now, plugin output and 
    performance data will collapse if they exceed a certain height.
    If necessary they can of course be expanded and keep that way 
    across browser restarts. The same is also true for the sidebar.
    (Though, this one stays collapsed)
    - Persistent Collapsible Containers #3638
    - Collapsible plugin output #3870
    - Collapsed sidebar should stay collapsed #3682
  * Markdown - Tables, Lists and Emphasized Text The Easy Way
    Since we now have the possibility to collapse large content 
    dynamically, we allow you to add entire wiki pages to hosts and
    services. Though, if you prefer to use a real wiki to maintain 
    those (what we'd strongly suggest) it's now easier than ever 
    before to link to it. Copy url, paste url, submit comment,Done.
    - Make notes, comments and announcements markdown aware #3814
    - Transform any URL in a Comment to a clickable Link #3441
    - Support relative links in plugin output #2916
  * Things You Have Missed Previously
    The tactical overview, our fancy pie charts, is now the very 
    first result when you search something in the sidebar. 
    If you'll see two entirely green circles there, relax. 
    Also overdue or unreachable checks are now appropriately marked
    in list views and the service grid now allows you to switch 
    between everything or problems only.
    - Add tactical overview to global search #3845
    - Servicegrid: Add toggle to show problems only #3871
    - Make overdue/unreachable checks better visible #3860
  * Authorization - Knowing and Controlling What's Going On
    Roles can now be even more tailored to users since the 
    introduction of a new placeholder. This placeholder allows to
    use a user's name in restrictions. 
    Things like _service_responsible_person=$user:local_name$ are 
    now possible. The audit log now receives failed login-attempts,
    that's been made possible since hooks can now run for anonymous
    users.
    - Allow roles to filter for the currently logged in user #3493
    - Add possibility to disable permission checks for hooks #3849
    - Send failed login-attempts to the audit log #3856
  See also the audit module which got an update and is required for
  #3856 to work.

Thu Apr 25 10:37:29 UTC 2019 - Martin Liška <mliska@suse.cz>

- update to 2.6.3
  You can find issues related to this release on our Roadmap.
  * PHP 7.3
    - Now supported. tada
  * LDAP - Community contributions, that's the spirit
    With the help of our users we've finally fixed the issue that 
    defining multiple hostnames and enabling STARTTLS has never 
    properly worked. Also, they've identified that defining 
    multiple hostnames caused a customized port not being utilized 
    and fixed it themselves.
    There has also a rare case been fixed that caused no group 
    members being found in case object classes had a different
    casing than what we expected. (Good news for all the 
    non-OpenLdap and non-MSActiveDirectory users)
    - LDAP connection fails with multiple servers using STARTTLS 
      #3639
    - LDAPS authentication ignores custom port setting #3713
    - LDAP group members not found #3650
  * We take care about your data even better now
    With this are newlines and HTML entities (such as &nbsp;) in 
    plugin output and custom variables meant.
    Sorry if I've teased some data security folks now. innocent
    - Newlines in plugin output disappear #3662
    - Windows path separators are converted to newlines in custom 
      variables #3636
    - HTML entities in plugin output are not resolved if no other 
      HTML is there #3707
  * You've wondered how you got into a famous blue police box?
    Don't worry, not only you and the european union are sometimes
    unsure what's the correct time.
    - Set client timezone on DB connection #3525
    - Ensure a valid default timezone is set in any case #3747
    - Fix that the event detail view is not showing times in 
      correct timezone #3660
  * UI - The portal to your monitoring environment, improved
    The collapsible sidebar introduced with v2.5 has been plagued 
    by some issues since then. They're now fixed. Also, the UI 
    should now flicker less and properly preserve the scroll 
    position when interacting with action links. (This also allows
    the business process module to behave more stable when using 
    drag and drop in large configurations.)
    - Collapsible Sidebar Issues #3187
    - Fix title when closing right column #3654
    - Preserve scroll position upon form submits #3661
  * Corrected things we've broke recently
    That's due to preemptive changes to protect you from bad 
    individuals. Unfortunately this meant that some unforeseen
    side-effects appeared after the release of v2.6.2. 
    These are now fixed.
    - Multiline values in ini files broken #3705
    - PHP ini parser doesn't strip trailing whitespace #3733
    - Escaped characters in INI values are not unescaped #3648
    - Though, if you've faced issue #3705 you still need to take 
      manual action (if not already done) as the provided fix does 
      only prevent further occurrences of the resulting error. The
      required changes involve the transformation of all real 
      newlines in Icinga Web 2's INI files to literal \n or \r\n
      sequences. (Files likely having such are the roles.ini and 
      announcements.ini)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
