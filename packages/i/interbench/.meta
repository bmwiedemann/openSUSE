  <description>This benchmark application is designed to benchmark interactivity in Linux. See
the included file readme.interactivity for a brief definition. 

It is designed to measure the effect of changes in Linux kernel design or system
configuration changes such as cpu, I/O scheduler and filesystem changes and
options. With careful benchmarking, different hardware can be compared.</description>
