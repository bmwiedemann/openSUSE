%description
Initviocons can be used on the iSeries platform to recognize terminal
features of a telnet client that is connected to the virtual console
(similar to a serial console). It probes the terminal via escape
sequences to find out the screen size and a suitable TERM type. It also
does special initialization if possible (for example, carriage return
suppression for Windows telnet clients). On the iSeries platform, it
additionally checks for the presence of more than one terminal
connected on the same line. See /etc/profile for a usage example.
