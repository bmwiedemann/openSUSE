-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov 22 13:36:58 UTC 2024 - Aleksa Sarai <asarai@suse.com>

- Remove the incus.sysctl drop-in file. This setting file overlaps with lxd's
  sysctl settings, and setting these sysctls on boot even if you aren't running
  containers is suboptimal.

  We could come up with a complicated scheme for loading the rules once Incus
  starts, as suggested in bsc#1233410, but ultimately these settings are only
  really useful for production servers with >100 containers, at which point
  admins are expected to tune their servers anyway.

  So we can just remove it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov 22 13:31:58 UTC 2024 - Aleksa Sarai <asarai@suse.com>

Fri Nov 21 15:24:17 UTC 2024 - Charles Miller <charlesmillerspam@gmail.com>

  blobs. There is an upstream bug here, so we will need to fix this again later
  once <https://github.com/lxc/incus/pull/1406> is merged.

- Move some binaries to sbin to match upstream packaging recommendations.
- Update VM-related dependencies to make VMs work properly.

Wed Oct 23 10:11:25 UTC 2024 - Aleksa Sarai <asarai@suse.com>

- Fix %_libexecdir usage for Leap 15.x (Leap 15.x still uses /usr/lib, so we
  need to replace the usage of /usr/libexec in our scripts with a token that we
  can replace during build).

Mon Oct 21 05:02:17 UTC 2024 - Aleksa Sarai <asarai@suse.com>

- Rework packaging to match recommended packaging from doc/packaging.md and
  <https://github.com/zabbly/incus/tree/stable/systemd>.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct 18 11:33:24 UTC 2024 - Aleksa Sarai <asarai@suse.com>

- Package Incus 6.6, based on the LXD 5.21 package. The primary differences are
  that we no longer need to do ELF patching to work around having a custom
  sqlite fork (instead we can use libcowsql, which is packaged for openSUSE
  already).
