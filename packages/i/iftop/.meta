  <title>Real-Time Interface Bandwidth Usage</title>
  <description>iftop does for network usage what top(1) does for CPU usage. It listens
to network traffic on a named interface and displays a table of current
bandwidth usage by pairs of hosts. It is handy for explaining why the
network links slow.</description>
