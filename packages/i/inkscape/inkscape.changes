    use a keyboard shortcut or going through the menus
  * It is now possible to copy, cut and paste parts of paths with

  * Preferences options are now easier to find by using the new

    least one desktop file.
  + %icon_theme_cache_post/postun because the package ships themed
    icons.
- Pass %{?no_lang_C} to %find_lang so that english documentation
  can be packaged with the program, and not in the lang subpackage.
