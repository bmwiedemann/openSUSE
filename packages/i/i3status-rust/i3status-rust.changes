- Update to 0.20.0
  * These have been moved out into files instead of being hardcoded in the Rust source. The following folders are checked in this order: first $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/i3status-rust/<icons|themes>, next $HOME/.local/share/i3status-rust/<icons|themes>, finally /usr/share/i3status-rust/<icons|themes>. If installing manually via cargo, you will need to copy the files to an appropriate location (an install.sh script is provided which does this). If installing via the AUR on Arch Linux, the package will install the files to /usr/share/i3status-rust/<icons|themes> for you, so you do not need to do anything (this should also be true for other distros assuming the package maintainer has packaged i3status-rust correctly).
  * Per block theme overrides have been renamed from color_overrides to theme_overrides (this was previously undocumented but has since been mentioned in themes.md)
  * Formatting for all blocks using format strings has been overhauled to allow users to customise how numbers and strings are displayed, which was not possible previously. Due to this some blocks may now display slightly differently to previous versions and have been documented below. Refer to the formatting documentation to get more information on the new formatting options.
  * CPU Utilization block: Due to an overhaul of our internal code, the per_core option has been removed. The same configuration can be achieved using the new {utilization<n>} format keys.
  * Battery and Disk Space blocks: The {bar} format key has been removed in favor of the new bar formatter. For example, to make the Battery block display the current percentage as a 6 character bar with 100% as the max value, set the format string as so: format = "{percentage:6#100}.
  * Disk Space block: The {unit} format key has been removed since the unit of {free} and similar format keys don't rely on unit configuration option anymore.
  * Maildir block: this is now optional and must be enabled at compile time (#1103 by @MaxVerevkin)
  * Memory block: all old format keys have been removed, refer to the table below for more details.
  * Net block: use_bits, speed_min_unit, speed_digits and max_ssid_width configuration options have been removed and require manual intervention to fix your config. speed_min_unit is replaced by the min prefix formatter. max_ssid_width is replaced by the max width formatter.
  * Net block: partially moved from calling external commands to using the netlink interface, which may not work on BSD systems (#1142 by @MaxVerevkin)
  * Networkmanager block: max_ssid_width config option has been removed, but the bevaviour can be restored using the max width formatter. For example, max_ssid_width = 10 is now achieved with ap_format = "{ssid^10}".
  * Sound block: max_width config option has been removed, but the bevaviour can be restored using the max width formatter.
  * Speedtest block: bytes, speed_min_unit and speed_digits configuration options have been removed in favour of the new format string formatter. For example, to replicate bytes=true; speed_min_unit="M", speed_digits=4 use format = "{speed_down:4*B;M}{speed_up:4*B;M}"
  * Disk Space block: the alias has been deprecated in favour of using format and may be removed in a future release.
  * Backlight block: new invert_icons config option for people using coloured icons (#1098 by @MaxVerevkin)
  * Net block: new format_alt option to set an alternative format string to switch between when the block is clicked (#1063 by @MaxVerevkin)
