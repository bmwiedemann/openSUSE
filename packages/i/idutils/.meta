  <title>Language-Independent Identifier Database Tool</title>
  <description>Mkid is a simple, fast, high-capacity, and language-independent
identifier database tool.  Actually, the term identifier is too
limiting--mkid stores tokens, be they program identifiers of any form,
literal numbers, or ordinary words.  Database queries can be issued
from the command line or from within Emacs, serving as an augmented
tags facility.</description>
