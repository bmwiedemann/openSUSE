Mon Jul 27 07:02:17 UTC 2015 - sleep_walker@opensuse.org

- bump to 1.2.0
  Changes:
   The 'isync' compatibility wrapper is now deprecated.

   An IMAP Path/NAMESPACE rooted in INBOX won't be handled specially
   any more. This means that some Patterns may need adjustment.

   The default output is a lot less verbose now.

   The meanings of the -V and -D options changed significantly.

   The SSL/TLS configuration has been re-designed. SSL is now
   explicitly enabled or disabled - "use SSL if available" is gone.
   Notice: Tunnels are assumed to be secure and thus default to no SSL.

   Support for SASL (flexible authentication) has been added.

   Support for Windows file systems has been added.

   Support for compressed data transfer has been added.

   Folder deletions can be propagated now.
