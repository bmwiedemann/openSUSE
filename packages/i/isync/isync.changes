    Delete/--delete/-d to Gone/--gone/-g

    and v1.1 by default
  * Renamed SSLType option to TLSType
  * Placeholders will be now created for messages exceeding MaxSize even if they
    are flagged on the source side
  * Placeholder upgrades no longer pull flag updates along unless also requested
  * New messages which we are about to expunge from the source side are not
    propaged any more even if the target side would keep them
  * Tunnel is now consistently assumed to be secure, so some warnings are gone
  * Worked around "unexpected EOF" error messages at end of TLS connections;
    affects f.ex. GMail

  * Fixed expunges not being propagated at all if the first run after they
    occurred did not include --delete
  * Fixed MaxMessages being exceeded when only --new was used
  * Fixed messages being instantly expired despite being important when only
    --new was used
  * Trash-ing failures now prevent expunging and cause a non-zero exit code
  * Fixed placeholders being needlessly trashed
  * Fixed TrashNewOnly and TrashRemoteNew omitting messages for which only
    a placeholder was synced
  * Fixed TrashRemoteNew omitting messages which exceed MaxSize
  * Fixed TrashRemoteNew not using race-free expunge

    no placeholders are present
  * Fixed crash when Patterns yields nothing when built with new compilers
  * Fixed crash when all flag propagations to a mailbox failed
  * Fixed handling of errors during opening mailboxes
  * Removed useless "lost track of ... messages" warnings when resuming after
    an interruption
  * Fixed many minor bugs in corner cases, mostly when resuming after
    interruptions
- remove patch work-around-unexpected-EOF-error-messages-at-end-of-SSL-connections.patch
  as upstream integrated the patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb 27 01:47:06 UTC 2023 - Yifan Jiang <yfjiang@suse.com>

- Add patch work-around-unexpected-EOF-error-messages-at-end-of-SSL-connections.patch
  * Some mail servers do not send a close notification
    (SSL_shutdown()) before closing the TCP socket. This workaround
    makes isync handles the situation more gracefully (boo#1208166).

Mon Jul 27 07:02:17 UTC 2015 - sleep_walker@opensuse.org

- bump to 1.2.0
  Changes:
   The 'isync' compatibility wrapper is now deprecated.

   An IMAP Path/NAMESPACE rooted in INBOX won't be handled specially
   any more. This means that some Patterns may need adjustment.

   The default output is a lot less verbose now.

   The meanings of the -V and -D options changed significantly.

   The SSL/TLS configuration has been re-designed. SSL is now
   explicitly enabled or disabled - "use SSL if available" is gone.
   Notice: Tunnels are assumed to be secure and thus default to no SSL.

   Support for SASL (flexible authentication) has been added.

   Support for Windows file systems has been added.

   Support for compressed data transfer has been added.

   Folder deletions can be propagated now.
