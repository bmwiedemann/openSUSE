  <title>IPsec Utilities</title>
  <description>This is the IPsec-Tools package.  This package is needed to really make
use of the IPsec functionality in the version 2.5 and 2.6 Linux
kernels.  This package builds:

- libipsec, a PFKeyV2 library

- setkey, a program to directly manipulate policies and SAs

- racoon, an IKEv1 keying daemon

These sources can be found at the IPsec-Tools home page at:
