Changes for openSUSE / SLE:

* ignition-mount-initrd-fstab.service:
  Upstream Ignition will only mount partitions or subvolumes explicitly
  mentioned in the Ignition configuration. A default SUSE system, however,
  is split over several subvolumes, and most users won't want to define
  all the partitions again. On the other hand a lot of core functionality (e.g.
  configuring a SSH certificate for the root user or adding a configuration
  file) requires access to those subvolumes.
  For better usability in addition to Ignition's own mount / umount stage all
  files systems tagged for being mounted in the initrd ("x-initrd.mount" mount
  flag) will automatically be mounted / umounted.
* ignition-setup-user-suse.sh / ignition-userconfig-timeout*.conf:
  The user configuration can be stored on a device with the label "ignition"
  (e.g. by attaching a USB flash drive with that name) instead of putting the
  file onto the root partition.
* ignition-suse-generator:
  Supplements the upstream generator by adding dependencies to
  ignition-setup-user-suse.sh and ignition-mount-initrd-fstab.service.
  Additionally it will try to autodect the platform if it is not set on the
  kernel command line.
* 02_ignition_firstboot:
  This file has been part of upstream ignition-dracut, but has since then been
  moved to a static CoreOS specific configuration
  (https://github.com/coreos/coreos-assembler/pull/616); it is now used in a
  modified version adapted to SUSE's needs.
  This script will automatically set the kernel parameters to trigger an
  Ignition run if a flag file does not exist (e.g. on first boot). To trigger
  an Ignition run manually just delete the file
  "/boot/writable/firstboot_happened".
* change-ignition-firstboot-path.conf:
  Overwrite CoreOS specific path.
* ignition-enable-network.service / ignition-enable-network.sh:
  Ignition supports detection whether the configuration requires networking
  to avoid having to boot with networking enabled even when it isn't
  necessary; the actual implementation to start the network is left to the
  distribution.
