Subject: [PATCH] Order ignition-disks.service before systemd-fsck-root.service

firstboot-detect.service needs initrd-root-device.target but has to be before
any ignition units, so ignition units can't use
Before=initrd-root-device.target. Use systemd-fsck-root.service instead, which
fits the comment above more anyway.
