  <title>A package that provides easy-to-use IPMI server management utilities</title>
  <description>The ipmiutil package provides easy-to-use utilities to view the SEL, 
perform an IPMI chassis reset, set up the IPMI LAN and Platform Event Filter 
entries to allow SNMP alerts, and other IPMI tasks.  
These can be invoked with the metacommand ipmiutil, or via subcommand 
shortcuts as well.  Man pages are provided.
An IPMI driver can be provided by either the OpenIPMI driver (/dev/ipmi0)
or the Intel IPMI driver (/dev/imb), etc.  If used locally and no driver is
detected, ipmiutil will use user-space direct I/Os instead.</description>
