  <title>Python module for converting images to PDF via direct JPEG inclusion</title>
  <description>This module losslessly converts raster images to PDF. The file size
will not unnecessarily increase. It can, for example, be used to
create a PDF document from a number of scans that are only available
in JPEG format. Existing solutions would either re-encode the input
JPEG files (leading to quality loss) or store them in the Deflate
format which results in the PDF becoming unnecessarily large in terms
of file size.
