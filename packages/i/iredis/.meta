  <title>Terminal client for Redis with auto-completion and syntax highlighting</title>
  <description>A terminal client for redis with auto-completion and syntax
highlighting. IRedis lets you type Redis commands smoothly, and displays results
in a user-friendly format.

IRedis is an alternative for redis-cli. In most cases, IRedis behaves exactly
the same as redis-cli. Besides, it is safer to use IRedis on production servers
than redis-cli: IRedis will prevent accidentally running dangerous commands
