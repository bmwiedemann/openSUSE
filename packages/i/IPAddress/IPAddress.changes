- Upgrade to version 5.5.1
  * Fixes of 5.3.4:
    + a fix to avoid ClassCastException when converting IPv4-mapped
      address to java.net.Inet6Address (#73)
    + fixed the creation of HostName from an unresolved
      compressed-IPv6 socket address (#74)
    + added IPAddressString.isIPv4Mapped for issue #75
    + fixed a class-loading issue with string parsing (#79)
    + removed AddressDivision.getDivisionValueCount() and
      AddressDivision.getDivisionPrefixCount(int) because of
      potential overflow with divisions 63 or 64 bits long. If you
      have a segment, use getValueCount(), or with IPAddressSegment
      use getPrefixValueCount(int), which both return int.
      Otherwise, use getPrefixCount(int) or getCount() which return
      BigInteger
    + fixed issues with comparing non-standard division groupings
      with address comparators
    + added verification when host-masking multiple-valued segments
    + added verification when splitting IPv6AddressSegment
    + fixed check when reversing per-byte multiple-valued division
    + fixed trie-printing method option withNonAddedKeys
    + fixed an issue with serialization of parsed hosts with
      qualifiers
    + added control over parsing empty zones (a zone specifier
      followed by no zone)
    + added a small fix to host name parsing some unusual host names
    + a fix to IPv4AddressSection.toMaxHost
    + fixed a rare synchronization issue when generating division
      strings in AddressDivisionBase
  * Fixes of 5.4.0:
    + added PrefixBlockAllocator for automatic CIDR prefix block
      allocation
    + added AddedTree and AssociativeAddedTree classes for expanded
      constructAddedNodesTree methods
    + added getBlockSize and getBitsForCount in AddressItem
    + added matchUnordered and matchOrdered in Address
    + eliminated invalid AddressValueException when joining a range
      with the IPv4 max value to an IPv6 range (#86)
    + fix to generation of strings from parsed address data (#87)
    + fix to IPv4 address primitive int upper value generation (#96)
  * Fix of 5.4.1:
    + fix to invalid radix argument infinite loop
      (#118, CVE-2023-50570)
  * Fixes of 5.4.2:
    + removed unnecessary SDK dependency incompatible with Java 8
      that was introduced with version 5.4.1 (#121)
  * Fixes of 5.5.0:
    + added collection types for dual IPv4/v6 tries and for dual
      IPv4/v6 associative tries, issue #103
    + trie performance improvements for all trie operations
    + added shortestPrefixMatch trie methods
    + added enumerate methods, the inverse of the increment methods,
      to find the position of an address in a subnet, or to find
      the distance between two addresses
    + added an increment method accepting a BigInteger argument to
      IPv6Address and IPv6AddressSection
    + added the ability to construct an IPv6Address from two longs
    + added replace methods with address section parameter to
      address classes
    + added overlaps methods to check for overlapping subnets, and
      for checking sequential range overlap with a subnet
    + added floor/lower/ceiling/higher methods to the address trie
      types, these methods previously accessible only from trie sets
    + added the extraneous digits IPv4 parsing option
      allow_inet_aton_extraneous_digits (#105)
  * Fixes of 5.5.1:
    + added new merge functions mergeToDualPrefixBlocks and
      mergeToDualSequentialBlocks for combined IPv4/IPv6 merging
    + added public constructors accepting message strings to
      AddressValueException and IncompatibleAddressException (#127)
    + removed caching functionality from containingFirstIterator,
      use all-node containingFirstAllNodeIterator instead
