- Update to version 3.3:
  * Fix a bug left-over in one of the 3.2 bug fixes where some
    accelerometers would fail to initialise.
- Changes from version 3.2:
  * Fix problems parsing numbers with decimal separator.

Wed Jun 16 12:27:02 UTC 2021 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Update to version 3.1:
  * Port to meson as a build system and add a test-suite.
  * Fix long-standing problem with property changes being sent as
    a broadcast.
  * Fix sensor support for accelerometers with different scales on
    different axes.
  * Add sensor support for RGBC light sensors.
  * Support reading proximity threshold from sysfs for DeviceTree
    devices.

  URL (not requiring commit id).
- Switch to meson based building.
- New BuildRequires: meson (for building), gtk-doc (to generate
  docs); update required version of gudev to 234 in keeping with
  minimum required version upstream.

Tue Jul 14 17:38:12 UTC 2020 - Bj√∏rn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 3.0:
  + This release adds support for a number of sensors that didn't
    work before, usually due to being combined with other sensors
    of the same or different types (eg. dual-accelerometers,
    light/proximity combined sensors, etc.), and adds support for
    kernel-exported mount-matrix properties on Device Tree
    hardware.
  + Update URL and Source to new home on gitlab.freedesktop.org.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 11 08:10:23 UTC 2019 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

    (also drop BuildRequires on autotools and a run of autoreconf
    in the build stage that this patch necessitated).
  + iio-sensor-proxy-revert-cast-align-warnings-arm-fix.patch.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Oct 28 16:26:56 UTC 2017 - badshah400@gmail.com

  values; patch taken from upstream (boo#1061190,
  gh#hadess/iio-sensor-proxy#191).
- Add relevant package Group for both iio-sensor-proxy
  (System/Monitor) and iio-sensor-proxy-doc (Documentation/HTML).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb  2 15:47:58 UTC 2017 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 2.1:

    other than iio-sensor-proxy, that have a system D-Bus
    interface.
  + Make D-Bus policy rules only affect SensorProxy itself.
  + Lockdown service through systemd.
  + Fix startup problem on machines with a Compass device.

  + This release adds build fixes, fixes the detection of a number
    of devices that should be supported, stops trying to use

    accelerometers on devices where the default does not work.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan 20 14:38:05 UTC 2016 - badshah400@gmail.com
