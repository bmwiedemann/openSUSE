    <comment>- Update to version 0.0.0+git20230610.0e73809:
  * A function is not deferred until after it and its args have been evaluated.
  * Update issue templates
  * Check length of builder.defers as maybePanic may be called outside of a function scope.
  * Do not mark named function results as used if an operation might panic but will not be recovered (i.e., when there is no defer statement).
  * Don't type-check the code being analyzed.
  * Missed a spot.
  * Don't treat nil initialization as assignment.
  * doc:  clarify meaning of ineffectual assignment
- Use _service mode manual as better alias name than disabled (forwarded request 1103638 from jfkw)</comment>
