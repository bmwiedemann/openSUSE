- Update to version 0.0.0+git20180909.1003c8b:
  * Don't treat initialization to zero like `x := int64(0)` as assignment.
  * Guard against invalid code (break/continue outside of loop).
  * Definitely don't panic in maybePanic.
  * Mark named function results as used in operations that may panic.
  * Don't treat explicit initialization to zero as assignment; it is often used as shorthand for a bare declaration.
  * Support multiple path arguments on the command line.
  * Add a note to the README about limitations.
  * Slicing an array or taking the address of an array element causes the array to escape.
  * Use control flow analysis to find more useless assignments.
  * ignore vendor directories
