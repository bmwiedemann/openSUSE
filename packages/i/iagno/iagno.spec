%description
Iagno is the two player strategy game of Othello, which is also known
as Reversi and is similar to Go. The pieces are tiles that are black
on one side and white on the other and the objective is for the player
to flip his/her opponent's tiles to his/her color, while keeping the
opponent from doing the same. Once the board is filled with tiles, the
winner is the player with the most of his/her color tiles on the
board.
