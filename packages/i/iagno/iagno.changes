Wed Sep  4 14:55:04 CEST 2019 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 3.33.92:
  + Updated translations.
- Changes from version 3.33.91:
  + Some more AI things: had to adjust a bit their level, as they
    were too hard (!). Other than that, one small bug fixed.
- Changes from version 3.33.90:
  + The UI has changed a bit. The scorer is not displayed anymore,
    as it was suggesting the good strategy would be to turn as many
    pieces of the opponent as possible during a game (hint: it is
    not); it has been replaced by a simple indication of the
    current player, visible in the headerbar.
  + The New Game button was moved also, allowing to draw the board
    centered.
  + All this permits to make the game able to run on small screens,
    and it probably makes the window layout a bit cleaner.
  + For a similar reason, the themes dialog has gone and is now
    replaced by a submenu of the hamburger menu.
- Changes from version 3.33.5:
  + Just trying to fix build on some platforms.
- Changes from version 3.33.4:
  + Many changes; please, have fun testing.
  + First of all, there is a new AI (for Medium and Hard); it is
    only a depth 3 (for Hard) instead of a depth 6, and so there
    should never be a lag again; and it is a bit harder I think –at
    least, it defeats usually the old AI– while using mostly the
    same tricks, as its strategy feels a bit more obscure.
  + Secondly, if you play with a mouse, the currently targetted
    tile is highlighted, if it is playable; that feels not too much
    disturbing, but may be a bit reassuring sometimes.
  + Thirdly, an option has been added to highlight the opponent
    tiles that might be turned by a ply; that should be helpful for
    casual players and newbies. And, trying to play (using mouse
    or keyboard) on an occupied tile (briefly) highlights the
    playable tiles (this might evolve in the future).
- Changes from version 3.33.2:
  + The AI is now five times faster, for similar results.
- Replace pkgconfig(libcanberra) and pkgconfig(libcanberra-gtk3) by
  pkgconfig(gsound): follow upstreams port to GSound.

Thu Feb 21 16:46:21 UTC 2019 - bjorn.lie@gmail.com

- Update to version 3.31.91:
  + The user can now display the final state of the game, by
    undoing after (or during) the final animation; and this
    animation is also more reliable (it was randomly failing).
    Also, the Adwaita (blue) theme that is used as default already
    if the user changes GNOME settings to always use dark theme is
    now also default when the Gtk theme is Adwaita-dark. Other than
    that, many code cleanings and various small fixes (highlight,
    focus).
  + Updated translations.
