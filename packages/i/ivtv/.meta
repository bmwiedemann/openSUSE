  <title>Driver Implementation for iCompression or Conexant Video Capture Cards</title>
  <description>The primary goal of the IVTV project is to provide a &quot;clean room&quot; Linux
open source driver implementation for video capture cards based on the
iCompression iTVC15 or Conexant CX23415/CX23416 MPEG Codec. Examples of
such cards are the Hauppauge PVR 250/350 series of MPEG video capture
cards, the Hauppauge &quot;freestyle&quot;, and the AVerMedia M179 AVerTV. The
freestyle has not been tested, but it should work or at least be easy
to get working.</description>
