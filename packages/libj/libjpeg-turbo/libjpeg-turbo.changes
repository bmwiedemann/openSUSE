-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 15 18:07:30 UTC 2022 - Tom Mbrt <tom.mbrt@googlemail.com>

- update to 2.1.4:
  * Fixed a regression introduced in 2.1.3 that caused build failures with
    Visual Studio 2010.

  * The tjDecompressHeader3() function in the TurboJPEG C API and the
    TJDecompressor.setSourceImage() method in the TurboJPEG Java API now
    accept "abbreviated table specification" (AKA "tables-only") datastreams,
    which can be used to prime the decompressor with quantization and Huffman
    tables that can be used when decompressing subsequent "abbreviated image"
    datastreams.

  * libjpeg-turbo now performs run-time detection of AltiVec instructions on
    OS X/PowerPC systems if AltiVec instructions are not enabled at compile
    time. This allows both AltiVec-equipped (PowerPC G4 and G5) and
    non-AltiVec-equipped (PowerPC G3) CPUs to be supported using the same
    build of libjpeg-turbo.

  * Fixed an error ("Bogus virtual array access") that occurred when
    attempting to decompress a progressive JPEG image with a height less than
    or equal to one iMCU (8 * the vertical sampling factor) using
    buffered-image mode with interblock smoothing enabled. This was a
    regression introduced by 2.1 beta1[6(b)].

  * Fixed two issues that prevented partial image decompression from working
    properly with buffered-image mode:
      * Attempting to call jpeg_crop_scanline() after jpeg_start_decompress()
        but before jpeg_start_output() resulted in an error ("Improper call to
        JPEG library in state 207".)
      * Attempting to use jpeg_skip_scanlines() resulted in an error ("Bogus
        virtual array access") under certain circumstances.

Sun Mar 20 19:33:28 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 2.1.3:
  * Fixed a regression introduced by 2.0 beta1[7] whereby cjpeg compressed PGM
    input files into full-color JPEG images unless the `-grayscale` option was
    used.
  
  * cjpeg now automatically compresses GIF and 8-bit BMP input files into
    grayscale JPEG images if the input files contain only shades of gray.
  
  * The build system now enables the intrinsics implementation of the AArch64
    (Arm 64-bit) Neon SIMD extensions by default when using GCC 12 or later.
  
  * Fixed a segfault that occurred while decompressing a 4:2:0 JPEG image using
    the merged (non-fancy) upsampling algorithms (that is, with
    `cinfo.do_fancy_upsampling` set to `FALSE`) along with `jpeg_crop_scanline()`.
    Specifically, the segfault occurred if the number of bytes remaining in the
    output buffer was less than the number of bytes required to represent one
    uncropped scanline of the output image.  For that reason, the issue could only
    be reproduced using the libjpeg API, not using djpeg.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov 24 21:39:14 UTC 2021 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 2.1.2:
  * Fixed a regression introduced by 2.1 beta1[13] that caused the remaining
    GAS implementations of AArch64 (Arm 64-bit) Neon SIMD functions (which are used
    by default with GCC for performance reasons) to be placed in the `.rodata`
    section rather than in the `.text` section.  This caused the GNU linker to
    automatically place the `.rodata` section in an executable segment, which
    prevented libjpeg-turbo from working properly with other linkers and also
    represented a potential security risk.
  * Fixed an issue whereby the `tjTransform()` function incorrectly computed the
    MCU block size for 4:4:4 JPEG images with non-unary sampling factors and thus
    unduly rejected some cropping regions, even though those regions aligned with
    8x8 MCU block boundaries.
  * Fixed a regression introduced by 2.1 beta1[13] that caused the build system
    to enable the Arm Neon SIMD extensions when targetting Armv6 and other legacy
    architectures that do not support Neon instructions.
  * libjpeg-turbo now performs run-time detection of AltiVec instructions on
    FreeBSD/PowerPC systems if AltiVec instructions are not enabled at compile
    time.  This allows both AltiVec-equipped and non-AltiVec-equipped CPUs to be
    supported using the same build of libjpeg-turbo.
  * cjpeg now accepts a `-strict` argument similar to that of djpeg and
    jpegtran, which causes the compressor to abort if an LZW-compressed GIF input
    image contains incomplete or corrupt image data.

Fri Aug 20 11:43:06 UTC 2021 - pgajdos@suse.com

- version update to 2.1.1
  1. Fixed a regression introduced in 2.1.0 that caused build failures
     with non-GCC-compatible compilers for Un*x/Arm platforms.
  2. Fixed a regression introduced by 2.1 beta1[13] that prevented the
     Arm 32-bit (AArch32) Neon SIMD extensions from building unless
     the C compiler flags included -mfloat-abi=softfp or -mfloat-abi=hard.
  3. Fixed an issue in the AArch32 Neon SIMD Huffman encoder whereby
     reliance on undefined C compiler behavior led to crashes
     ("SIGBUS: illegal alignment") on Android systems when running
     AArch32/Thumb builds of libjpeg-turbo built with recent versions
     of Clang.
  4. Added a command-line argument (-copy icc) to jpegtran that causes
     it to copy only the ICC profile markers from the source file and
     discard any other metadata.
  5. libjpeg-turbo should now build and run on CHERI-enabled
     architectures, which use capability pointers that are larger than
     the size of size_t.
  6. Fixed a regression introduced by 2.1 beta1[5] that caused a segfault
     in the 64-bit SSE2 Huffman encoder when attempting to losslessly
     transform a specially-crafted malformed JPEG image.

Mon Dec 28 15:39:18 UTC 2020 - pgajdos@suse.com

- version update to 2.0.6
  1. Fixed "using JNI after critical get" errors that occurred on Android
  platforms when using any of the YUV encoding/compression/decompression/decoding
  methods in the TurboJPEG Java API.
  2. Fixed or worked around multiple issues with `jpeg_skip_scanlines()`:
       - Fixed segfaults or "Corrupt JPEG data: premature end of data segment"
  errors in `jpeg_skip_scanlines()` that occurred when decompressing 4:2:2 or
  4:2:0 JPEG images using merged (non-fancy) upsampling/color conversion (that
  is, when setting `cinfo.do_fancy_upsampling` to `FALSE`.)  2.0.0[6] was a
  similar fix, but it did not cover all cases.
       - `jpeg_skip_scanlines()` now throws an error if two-pass color
  quantization is enabled.  Two-pass color quantization never worked properly
  with `jpeg_skip_scanlines()`, and the issues could not readily be fixed.
       - Fixed an issue whereby `jpeg_skip_scanlines()` always returned 0 when
  skipping past the end of an image.
  3. The Arm 64-bit (Armv8) Neon SIMD extensions can now be built using MinGW
  toolchains targetting Arm64 (AArch64) Windows binaries.
  4. Fixed unexpected visual artifacts that occurred when using
  `jpeg_crop_scanline()` and interblock smoothing while decompressing only the DC
  scan of a progressive JPEG image.
  5. Fixed an issue whereby libjpeg-turbo would not build if 12-bit-per-component
  JPEG support (`WITH_12BIT`) was enabled along with libjpeg v7 or libjpeg v8
  API/ABI emulation (`WITH_JPEG7` or `WITH_JPEG8`.)

Wed Aug 12 21:24:44 UTC 2020 - Matthias Eliasson <elimat@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 2.0.5
  * Worked around issues in the MIPS DSPr2 SIMD extensions that caused failures
    in the libjpeg-turbo regression tests. Specifically, the 
	jsimd_h2v1_downsample_dspr2() and jsimd_h2v2_downsample_dspr2() functions
	in the MIPS DSPr2 SIMD extensions are now disabled until/unless they can be
    fixed, and other functions that are incompatible with big endian MIPS CPUs
	are disabled when building libjpeg-turbo for such CPUs.
  * Fixed an oversight in the TJCompressor.compress(int) method in the
    TurboJPEG Java API that caused an error ("java.lang.IllegalStateException:
	No source image is associated with this instance") when attempting to use
	that method to compress a YUV image.
  * Fixed an issue (CVE-2020-13790) in the PPM reader that caused a buffer
    overrun in cjpeg, TJBench, or the tjLoadImage() function if one of the
	values in a binary PPM/PGM input file exceeded the maximum value defined in
	the file's header and that maximum value was less than 255. libjpeg-turbo
	1.5.0 already included a similar fix for binary PPM/PGM files with maximum
	values greater than 255.
  * The TurboJPEG API library's global error handler, which is used in
    functions such as tjBufSize() and tjLoadImage() that do not require a
	TurboJPEG instance handle, is now thread-safe on platforms that support
	thread-local storage.

Sun Mar 29 10:02:02 UTC 2020 - Aaron Stern <ukbeast89@protonmail.com>

- Upate to version 2.0.4:
- bug 388 was fixed upstream
  https://github.com/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/issues/388
- removed patches, as it is included in this release.
  * Fixed a regression in the Windows packaging system 
   (introduced by 2.0 beta1[2]) whereby, if both the 64-bit libjpeg-turbo 
   SDK for GCC and the 64-bit libjpeg-turbo SDK for Visual C++ were installed 
   on the same system, only one of them could be uninstalled.
  * Fixed a signed integer overflow and subsequent segfault that occurred when 
    attempting to decompress images with more than 715827882 pixels using the 64-bit C version of TJBench.
  * Fixed out-of-bounds write in tjDecompressToYUV2() and tjDecompressToYUVPlanes() 
    (sometimes manifesting as a double free) that occurred when attempting to decompress 
    grayscale JPEG images that were compressed with a sampling factor other than 1 
    (for instance, with cjpeg -grayscale -sample 2x2).
  * Fixed a regression introduced by 2.0.2[5] that caused the TurboJPEG API to incorrectly 
    identify some JPEG images with unusual sampling factors as 4:4:4 JPEG images. 
    This was known to cause a buffer overflow when attempting to decompress some such images using 
    tjDecompressToYUV2() or tjDecompressToYUVPlanes().
  * Fixed an issue, detected by ASan, whereby attempting to losslessly transform a specially-crafted 
    malformed JPEG image containing an extremely-high-frequency coefficient block 
    (junk image data that could never be generated by a legitimate JPEG compressor) could cause the 
    Huffman encoder's local buffer to be overrun. (Refer to 1.4.0[9] and 1.4beta1[15].) 
    Given that the buffer overrun was fully contained within the stack and did not cause a segfault 
    or other user-visible errant behavior, and given that the lossless transformer (unlike the decompressor) 
    is not generally exposed to arbitrary data exploits, this issue did not likely pose a security risk.
    The ARM 64-bit (ARMv8) NEON SIMD assembly code now stores constants in a separate read-only data 
    section rather than in the text section, to support execute-only memory layouts.

Sat Oct  5 09:08:03 UTC 2019 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 2.0.3:
  * Fixed "using JNI after critical get" errors that occurred on
    Android platforms when passing invalid arguments to certain
    methods in the TurboJPEG Java API.
  * Fixed a regression in the SIMD feature detection code,
    introduced by the AVX2 SIMD extensions (2.0 beta1), that was
    known to cause an illegal instruction exception, in rare cases,
    on CPUs that lack support for CPUID leaf (or on which the
    maximum CPUID leaf has been limited by way of a BIOS setting.)
  * The 4:4:0 (h1v2) fancy (smooth) chroma upsampling algorithm in
    the decompressor now uses a similar bias pattern to that of the
    4:2:2 (h2v1) fancy chroma upsampling algorithm, rounding up or
    down the upsampled result for alternate pixels rather than
    always rounding down. This ensures that, regardless of whether
    a 4:2:2 JPEG image is rotated or transposed prior to
    decompression (in the frequency domain) or after decompression
   (in the spatial domain), the final image will be similar.
  * Fixed an integer overflow and subsequent segfault that occurred
    when attempting to compress or decompress images with more than
    1 billion pixels using the TurboJPEG API.
  * Fixed a regression introduced by 2.0 beta1[15] whereby
    attempting to generate a progressive JPEG image on an
    SSE2-capable CPU using a scan script containing one or more
    scans with lengths divisible by 16 would result in an error
    ("Missing Huffman code table entry") and an invalid JPEG image.
  * Fixed an issue whereby `tjDecodeYUV()` and
    `tjDecodeYUVPlanes()` would throw an error ("Invalid
    progressive parameters") or a warning ("Inconsistent
    progression sequence") if passed a TurboJPEG instance that was
    previously used to decompress a progressive JPEG image.

- updated to version 2.0.2:
  1. Fixed a regression introduced by 2.0.1[5] that prevented a runtime search
  path (rpath) from being embedded in the libjpeg-turbo shared libraries and
  executables for macOS and iOS.  This caused a fatal error of the form
  "dyld: Library not loaded" when attempting to use one of the executables,
  unless `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` was explicitly set to the location of the
  libjpeg-turbo shared libraries.
  2. Fixed an integer overflow and subsequent segfault (CVE-2018-20330) that
  occurred when attempting to load a BMP file with more than 1 billion pixels
  using the `tjLoadImage()` function.
  3. Fixed a buffer overrun (CVE-2018-19664) that occurred when attempting to
  decompress a specially-crafted malformed JPEG image to a 256-color BMP using
  djpeg.
  4. Fixed a floating point exception that occurred when attempting to
  decompress a specially-crafted malformed JPEG image with a specified image
  width or height of 0 using the C version of TJBench.
  5. The TurboJPEG API will now decompress 4:4:4 JPEG images with 2x1, 1x2, 3x1,
  or 1x3 luminance and chrominance sampling factors.  This is a non-standard way
  of specifying 1x subsampling (normally 4:4:4 JPEGs have 1x1 luminance and
  chrominance sampling factors), but the JPEG format and the libjpeg API both
  allow it.
  6. Fixed a regression introduced by 2.0 beta1[7] that caused djpeg to generate
  incorrect PPM images when used with the `-colors` option.
  7. Fixed an issue whereby a static build of libjpeg-turbo (a build in which
  `ENABLE_SHARED` is `0`) could not be installed using the Visual Studio IDE.
  8. Fixed a severe performance issue in the Loongson MMI SIMD extensions that
  occurred when compressing RGB images whose image rows were not 64-bit-aligned.

Mon Dec 18 13:29:30 UTC 2017 - pgajdos@suse.com

- - update to version 1.5.3
  1. Fixed a NullPointerException in the TurboJPEG Java wrapper that occurred
  when using the YUVImage constructor that creates an instance backed by separate
  image planes and allocates memory for the image planes.
  2. Fixed an issue whereby the Java version of TJUnitTest would fail when
  testing BufferedImage encoding/decoding on big endian systems.
  3. Fixed a segfault in djpeg that would occur if an output format other than
  PPM/PGM was selected along with the `-crop` option.  The `-crop` option now
  works with the GIF and Targa formats as well (unfortunately, it cannot be made
  to work with the BMP and RLE formats due to the fact that those output engines
  write scanlines in bottom-up order.)  djpeg will now exit gracefully if an
  output format other than PPM/PGM, GIF, or Targa is selected along with the
  `-crop` option.
  4. Fixed an issue whereby `jpeg_skip_scanlines()` would segfault if color
  quantization was enabled.
  5. TJBench (both C and Java versions) will now display usage information if any
  command-line argument is unrecognized.  This prevents the program from silently
  ignoring typos.
  6. Fixed an access violation in tjbench.exe (Windows) that occurred when the
  program was used to decompress an existing JPEG image.
  7. Fixed an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in the TJExample Java program that
  occurred when attempting to decompress a JPEG image that had been compressed
  with 4:1:1 chrominance subsampling.
  8. Fixed an issue whereby, when using `jpeg_skip_scanlines()` to skip to the
  end of a single-scan (non-progressive) image, subsequent calls to
  `jpeg_consume_input()` would return `JPEG_SUSPENDED` rather than
  `JPEG_REACHED_EOI`.
  9. `jpeg_crop_scanlines()` now works correctly when decompressing grayscale
  JPEG images that were compressed with a sampling factor other than 1 (for
  instance, with `cjpeg -grayscale -sample 2x2`).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct 12 10:22:05 UTC 2017 - pgajdos@suse.com

- Update to version 1.5.2
  + Fixed several memory leaks in the TurboJPEG API library that
    could occur if the library was built with certain compilers
    and optimization levels.
  + The libjpeg-turbo memory manager will now honor the
    max_memory_to_use structure member in jpeg_memory_mgr, 
    which can be set to the maximum amount of memory (in bytes)
    that libjpeg-turbo should use during decompression or 
    multi-pass (including progressive) compression. This limit 
    can also be set using the JPEGMEM environment variable or 
    using the -maxmemory switch in cjpeg/djpeg/jpegtran.
  + TJBench will now run each benchmark for 1 second prior to 
    starting the timer, in order to improve the consistency of
    the results. Furthermore, the -warmup option is now used to
    specify the amount of warmup time rather than the number of
    warmup iterations.
  + Fixed an error (short jump is out of range) that occurred 
    when assembling the 32-bit x86 SIMD extensions with NASM
    versions prior to 2.04.
  + Fixed a regression introduced by 1.5 beta1[11] that prevented
    the Java version of TJBench from outputting any reference images
    (the -nowrite switch was accidentally enabled by default.)
    libjpeg-turbo should now build and run with full AltiVec SIMD
    acceleration on PowerPC-based AmigaOS 4 and OpenBSD systems.

- Update to version 1.5.1 fate#324061
  + Fix for PowerPC platforms lacking AltiVec instructions
  + Fix ABI problem with clang/llvm on aarch64.
  + Fancy upsampling is now supported when decompressing JPEG
    images that use 4:4:0 (h1v2) chroma subsampling.
  + If merged upsampling isn't SIMD-accelerated but YCbCr-to-RGB
    conversion is, then libjpeg-turbo will now disable merged
    upsampling when decompressing YCbCr JPEG images into RGB
    or extended RGB output images. This significantly speeds up
    the decompression of 4:2:0 and 4:2:2 JPEGs on ARM platforms
    if fancy upsampling is not used 
    (for example, if the -nosmooth option to djpeg is specified.)
  + The TurboJPEG API will now decompress 4:2:2 and 4:4:0 JPEG
    images with 2x2 luminance sampling factors and 2x1 or 1x2
    chrominance sampling factors.
  + Fixed an unsigned integer overflow in the libjpeg memory manager.
  + Fixed additional negative left shifts and other issues reported
    by the GCC and Clang undefined behavior sanitizers when
    attempting to decompress specially-crafted malformed JPEG
    images. None of these issues posed a security threat, but
    removing the warnings makes it easier to detect actual
    security issues, should they arise in the future.
  + Fixed an out-of-bounds array reference, introduced by
    1.4.902 and detected by the Clang undefined behavior sanitizer,
    that could be triggered by a specially-crafted malformed
    JPEG image with more than four components. Because the
    out-of-bounds reference was still within the same structure,
    it was not known to pose a security threat, but removing
    the warning makes it easier to detect actual security issues,
    should they arise in the future.

Wed Jun  8 07:53:26 UTC 2016 - idonmez@suse.com

- Update to version 1.5.0
  + Fixed an issue whereby a malformed motion-JPEG frame could
    cause the "fast path" of libjpeg-turbo's Huffman decoder to
    read from uninitialized memory.
  + Added libjpeg-turbo version and build information to the global
    string table of the libjpeg and TurboJPEG API libraries.
  + Fixed a couple of issues in the PPM reader that would cause
    buffer overruns in cjpeg if one of the values in a binary
    PPM/PGM input file exceeded the maximum value defined in the
    file's header. libjpeg-turbo 1.4.2 already included a similar
    fix for ASCII PPM/PGM files. Note that these issues were not
    security bugs, since they were confined to the cjpeg program
    and did not affect any of the libjpeg-turbo libraries.
  + Fixed an issue whereby attempting to decompress a JPEG file with
    a corrupt header using the tjDecompressToYUV2() function would
    cause the function to abort without returning an error and,
    under certain circumstances, corrupt the stack. This only
    occurred if tjDecompressToYUV2() was called prior to calling
    tjDecompressHeader3(), or if the return value from
    tjDecompressHeader3() was ignored (both cases represent
    incorrect usage of the TurboJPEG API.)
  + The jpeg_stdio_src(), jpeg_mem_src(), jpeg_stdio_dest(),
    and jpeg_mem_dest() functions in the libjpeg API will now
    throw an error if a source/destination manager has already
    been assigned to the compress or decompress object by a
    different function or by the calling program.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jan 10 00:39:57 UTC 2015 - p.drouand@gmail.com

- Update to version 1.4.0
  + Fixed a build issue on OS X PowerPC platforms (md5cmp failed to build
    because OS X does not provide the le32toh() and htole32() functions.)
  + The non-SIMD RGB565 color conversion code did not work correctly on big
    endian machines.  This has been fixed.
  + Fixed an issue in tjPlaneSizeYUV() whereby it would erroneously return 1
    instead of -1 if componentID was > 0 and subsamp was TJSAMP_GRAY.
  + Fixed an issue in tjBufSizeYUV2() wherby it would erroneously return 0
    instead of -1 if width was < 1.
  + The Huffman encoder now uses clz and bsr instructions for bit counting on
    ARM64 platforms (see 1.4 beta1 [5].)
  + The close() method in the TJCompressor and TJDecompressor Java classes is
    now idempotent.  Previously, that method would call the native tjDestroy()
    function even if the TurboJPEG instance had already been destroyed.  This
    caused an exception to be thrown during finalization, if the close() method had
    already been called.  The exception was caught, but it was still an expensive
    operation.
  + The TurboJPEG API previously generated an error ("Could not determine
    subsampling type for JPEG image") when attempting to decompress grayscale JPEG
    images that were compressed with a sampling factor other than 1 (for instance,
    with 'cjpeg -grayscale -sample 2x2').  Subsampling technically has no meaning
    with grayscale JPEGs, and thus the horizontal and vertical sampling factors
    for such images are ignored by the decompressor.  However, the TurboJPEG API
    was being too rigid and was expecting the sampling factors to be equal to 1
    before it treated the image as a grayscale JPEG.
  + cjpeg, djpeg, and jpegtran now accept an argument of -version, which will
    print the library version and exit.
  + Referring to 1.4 beta1 [15], another extremely rare circumstance was
    discovered under which the Huffman encoder's local buffer can be overrun
    when a buffered destination manager is being used and an
    extremely-high-frequency block (basically junk image data) is being encoded.
    Even though the Huffman local buffer was increased from 128 bytes to 136 bytes
    to address the previous issue, the new issue caused even the larger buffer to
    be overrun.  Further analysis reveals that, in the absolute worst case (such as
    setting alternating AC coefficients to 32767 and -32768 in the JPEG scanning
    order), the Huffman encoder can produce encoded blocks that approach double the
    size of the unencoded blocks.  Thus, the Huffman local buffer was increased to
    256 bytes, which should prevent any such issue from re-occurring in the future.
  + The new tjPlaneSizeYUV(), tjPlaneWidth(), and tjPlaneHeight() functions
    were not actually usable on any platform except OS X and Windows, because
    those functions were not included in the libturbojpeg mapfile.  This has been
    fixed.
  + Restored the JPP(), JMETHOD(), and FAR macros in the libjpeg-turbo header
    files.  The JPP() and JMETHOD() macros were originally implemented in libjpeg
    as a way of supporting non-ANSI compilers that lacked support for prototype
    parameters.  libjpeg-turbo has never supported such compilers, but some
    software packages still use the macros to define their own prototypes.
    Similarly, libjpeg-turbo has never supported MS-DOS and other platforms that
    have far symbols, but some software packages still use the FAR macro.  A pretty
    good argument can be made that this is a bad practice on the part of the
    software in question, but since this affects more than one package, it's just
    easier to fix it here.
  + Fixed issues that were preventing the ARM 64-bit SIMD code from compiling
    for iOS, and included an ARMv8 architecture in all of the binaries installed by
    the "official" libjpeg-turbo SDK for OS X.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 31 09:29:11 UTC 2014 - pgajdos@suse.com

- update to 1.3.1:
  *  Fixed a bug whereby attempting to encode a progressive JPEG 
     with arithmetic entropy coding (by passing arguments of 
     -progressive -arithmetic to cjpeg or jpegtran, for instance) 
     would result in an error, "Requested feature was omitted at 
     compile time".
  * Fixed a couple of issues whereby malformed JPEG images would 
    cause libjpeg-turbo to use uninitialized memory during 
    decompression.
  *  Fixed an error ("Buffer passed to JPEG library is too small")
     that occurred when calling the TurboJPEG YUV encoding function 
     with a very small (< 5x5) source image, and added a unit test 
     to check for this error.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 19 14:44:56 CEST 2011 - pgajdos@suse.cz

- updated to 1.1.1:
  * Fixed a 1-pixel error in row 0, column 21 of the luminance 
    plane generated by tjEncodeYUV().
  * libjpeg-turbo's accelerated Huffman decoder previously 
    ignored unexpected markers found in the middle of the 
    JPEG data stream during decompression. It will now 
    hand off decoding of a particular block to the unaccelerated 
    Huffman decoder if an unexpected marker is found, so that 
    the unaccelerated Huffman decoder can generate an appropriate 
    warning.
  * Fixed a bug in jpeg_read_coefficients() whereby it would 
    not initialize cinfo->image_width and cinfo->image_height 
    if libjpeg v7 or v8 emulation was enabled. This specifically 
    caused the jpegoptim program to fail if it was linked against 
    a version of libjpeg-turbo that was built with libjpeg v7 or 
    v8 emulation.
  * Eliminated excessive I/O overhead that occurred when reading 
    BMP files in cjpeg.
  * 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar  3 13:53:18 CET 2011 - pgajdos@suse.cz

  * Added further protections against invalid Huffman codes.
  * Added an extended version of tjDecompressHeader().
  * Added arithmetic encoding and decoding support.
  * TurboJPEG/OSS can now compress from/decompress to 
    grayscale bitmaps.
  * Added emulation of the libjpeg v7 and v8 APIs and ABIs.
  * Added two new TurboJPEG API functions, tjEncodeYUV() and
    tjDecompressToYUV().
  * The TurboJPEG dynamic library now uses versioned symbols.
  * Fixed visual artifacts in grayscale JPEG compression 
    caused by a typo in the RGB-to-chrominance lookup tables.
