# 389 Directory Server container image

## Description

[389 Directory Server](https://www.port389.org/) is a highly usable, fully
featured, reliable and secure LDAP server implementation.

## Usage

By default, the image launches 389 Directory Server with the same
configuration that comes with the SUSE Linux Enterprise Server. However there
is also included a pre-configured Name Service Switch (NSS) configuration
file (`/etc/nsswitch.conf`).

```ShellSession
$ podman run -it --rm -p 3389:3389 -p 3636:3636 registry.opensuse.org/opensuse/389-ds:%%389ds_version%%
```

## Volumes

The database is stored in the volume mounted as directory `/data`. A new
empty database is created during container startup, unless an existing
database is already present in `/data`.

To mount a host directory as a volume for your database, run the following
command:

```ShellSession
$ podman run -it --rm -v /my/own/datadir:/data:Z -p 3389:3389 -p 3636:3636 registry.opensuse.org/opensuse/389-ds:%%389ds_version%%
```

## Certificates

By default, the container uses a self-signed CA certificate and a server
certificate signed by that CA.

Place a custom TLS certificate in PEM format in `/data/tls/server.crt` and
the key in and `/data/tls/server.key`. Place the CA certificates (each as a
separate file) to `/data/tls/ca/`, for example, `/data/tls/ca/ca1.crt` and
`/data/tls/ca/ca2.crt`.

## Environment variables

### DS_ERRORLOG_LEVEL

Use this optional environment variable to set the log level for
`ns-slapd` (default is `266354688`).

### DS_DM_PASSWORD

Use this optional environment variable to set the `cn=Directory Manager`
password (a default password is generated randomly). The default randomly
generated password can be viewed in the setup log.

### DS_MEMORY_PERCENTAGE

Use this optional environment variable to set the LDBM autotune
percentage (`nsslapd-cache-autosize`) (default is unset).

### DS_REINDEX

Use this optional environment variable to run a database re-index task. Set
the value to `1` to enable the task (default is disabled).

### DS_SUFFIX_NAME

Use this optional environment variable to set the default database
suffix name for `basedn` (default one is derived from the hostname).

### DS_STARTUP_TIMEOUT

Use this optional environment variable to change the time to wait for the
instance to start (default is `60` seconds).

### DS_STOP_TIMEOUT

Use this optional environment variable to change the time to wait for the
instance to stop (default is `60` seconds).

## Health, liveness, and readiness

The container image includes one explicit health check. This check will
verify if the service is misconfigured, `ns-slapd` is running, and if the
LDAPI is functional.
