  <title>Interface to System Statistics</title>
  <description>The libstatgrab library provides an easy-to-use interface for accessing system
statistics and information.
Available statistics include CPU, Load, Memory, Swap, Disk I/O, and Network
I/O. It was developed to work on Linux, FreeBSD, and Solaris.

The package also includes two tools: saidar provides a curses-based interface
for viewing live system statistics, and statgrab is a sysctl-like interface to
the statistics.</description>
