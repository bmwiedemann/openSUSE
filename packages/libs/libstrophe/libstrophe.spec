%description
Strophe is a collection of libraries for speaking the XMPP protocol.

While most XMPP libraries and implementations are focused on chat-based applications,
Strophe takes a grander view.

It has been used to implement real-time games, notification systems, search engines,
as well as traditional instant messaging.

The implementations are production ready, well documented,
easy to use, and easy to extend.
