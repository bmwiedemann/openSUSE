  <title>Secure Replacements for Problematic C Functions</title>
  <description>The &quot;Secure Programming Library&quot; provides several functions that should
serve as a replacement for problematic C functions from glibc. Besides
the replacement functions, there are some helper functions, such as
safe_reopen() or sigprotection(), that can be used for developing
exposed applications.</description>
