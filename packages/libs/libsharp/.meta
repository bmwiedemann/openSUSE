  <title>Library for fast spherical harmonic transforms</title>
  <description>libsharp is a code library for spherical harmonic transforms (SHTs) with
features including MPI support for distributed memory systems and SHTs of
fields with arbitrary spin, supporting new developments in CPU instruction sets
like the Advanced Vector Extensions (AVX) or fused multiply-accumulate (FMA)
instructions.
