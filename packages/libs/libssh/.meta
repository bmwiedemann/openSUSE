  <title>SSH library</title>
  <description>The ssh library was designed to be used by programmers needing a
working SSH implementation by the mean of a library. The complete
control of the client is made by the programmer. With libssh, you can
remotely execute programs, transfer files, use a secure and transparent
tunnel for your remote programs. With its Secure FTP implementation,
you can play with remote files easily, without third-party programs
others than libcrypto (from openssl).

This package provides libssh from http://www.libssh.org that should not
be confused with libssh2 available from http://www.libssh2.org (libssh2
