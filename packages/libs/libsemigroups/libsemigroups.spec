%description -n %lname
A C++14 library containing implementations of several algorithms for
computing finite and finitely presented semigroups, namely:

  * the Froidure-Pin algorithm for computing finite semigroups
  * the Todd-Coxeter algorithm for finitely presented semigroups and monoids;
  * the Knuth-Bendix algorithm for finitely presented semigroups and monoids;
  * the Schreier-Sims algorithm for permutation groups.
