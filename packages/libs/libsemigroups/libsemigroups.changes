- Update to release 2.3.2
  * Fix inaccurate exception information for ``replace_subword``
  * string-view: fix bug in append method This bug sometimes
    caused the ``normal_form`` member function of the
    ``Kambites`` class template to return incorrect results, or
    sometimes to cause a crash.

    Sims1::find_if could crash.

    Tsalakou for finding normal forms in small overlap monoids in
    the class `Kambites`.
  * A performance improvement in the implementation of Konieczny
    algorithm, for determining the structure of a finite
    semigroup or monoid.
  * An implementation of the linear time algorithm by Radoszewski
    and Rytter for checking equality of words in free bands in
    the function.

    been improved, some deprecated functionality was remove, and
    other minor improvements, and simplifications were made.
