- Update to release 3.0.0
  * Reporting during a computation has been improved
  * Class interfaces were reduced in size, with member functions
    only calling other public member functions being moved into a
    helper namespace.
  * Most classes now use iterators exclusively in their interfaces.
  * The class ``ActionDigraph`` has been renamed ``WordGraph`` for
    consistency with the mathematical literature.
  * Some functionality that used to be in ``ActionDigraph`` has
    been move into the classes ``Gabow`` and ``Paths``.
  * The class ``Dot`` facilitates the creation and rendering of
    graph descriptions in the DOT language of the Graphviz graph
    drawing software.
  * Conversion from one libsemigroups type to another is now
    exclusively via the function template to.
  * Many constructors for classes where it is expected that many
    instances will be created (such as Transf, for example) do not
    perform any checks on their arguments. Alternative versions of
    these constructors, that do perform checks, are available using
    the ``make`` function.
  * Range objects are used fairly extensively throughout the
    library.
  * libsemigroups has been updated to use C++17 (from C++14).
