libsrtp is Cisco's implementation of the Secure Real-time Transport
Protocol (SRTP), the Universal Security Transform (UST), and a
supporting cryptographic kernel.

SRTP is a security profile for RTP that adds confidentiality, message
authentication, and replay protection to that protocol. It is
specified in RFC 3711. More information about the SRTP protocol
itself can be found on the Secure RTP page.
