%description -n %{name}%{sover}
libsoc is a C library to interface with common peripherals found in System
on Chips (SoC) through generic Linux Kernel interfaces.

It targets reliability rather than speed. No guarantees are made
on its determinism and it should not be used in time critical routines.
