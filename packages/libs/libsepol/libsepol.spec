%description
libsepol provides an API for the manipulation of SELinux binary
policies. It is used by checkpolicy (the policy compiler) and similar
tools, as well as by programs like load_policy that need to perform
specific transformations on binary policies such as customizing
policy boolean settings.

Type Enforcement, Role-based Access Control and Multi-Level
Security.)
