    <comment>- Update to 0.4.1:
  * The point multiplication algorithm used for ECDH operations
    (module ecdh) was replaced with a slightly faster one.
  * Optional handwritten x86_64 assembly for field operations was
    removed because modern C compilers are able to output more efficient
    assembly. This change results in a significant speedup of some
    library functions when handwritten x86_64 assembly is enabled
    (--with-asm=x86_64 in GNU Autotools, -DSECP256K1_ASM=x86_64 in CMake),
    which is the default on x86_64. Benchmarks with GCC 10.5.0 show a
    10% speedup for secp256k1_ecdsa_verify and secp256k1_schnorrsig_verify.</comment>

    <comment>- Update to 0.5.0:
  Added:
  * New function secp256k1_ec_pubkey_sort that sorts public keys
    using lexicographic (of compressed serialization) order.
  Changed:
  * The implementation of the point multiplication algorithm used
    for signing and public key generation was changed, resulting
    in improved performance for those operations. The related
    configure option --ecmult-gen-precision was replaced with
    --ecmult-gen-kb (ECMULT_GEN_KB for CMake).
    This changes the supported precomputed table sizes for these
    operations. The new supported sizes are 2 KiB, 22 KiB, or 86
    KiB (while the old supported sizes were 32 KiB, 64 KiB, or 512 KiB).
  ABI Compatibility:
  * The ABI is backward compatible with versions 0.4.x and 0.3.x.</comment>
