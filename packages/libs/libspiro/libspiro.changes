- update to 20240903:
  * Downgraded ./configure AC_PREREQ(2.70) to 2.69 to allow
    libspiro to be built for ELN distros.
- update to 20240902:
  * Removed bug introduced during 20221101 which caused libspiro
    to exit early without results. This was seen in Fontforge as
    straight lines (closes issue (see bug).
  * Updated configure.ac to also display $libdir since 64bit
    needs to run './configure --prefix=/usr --libdir=/usr/lib64'
    for distro installs (32bit ./configure --prefix=/usr' is
    enough).

- update to 20221101:
  * Bugfix - removed forgotten if-then code used with scaling tests.
    Majority of users won't notice a difference since most FontForge
    fonts are created in the +x,+y quadrant. Users that might see a
    change/difference are users drawing only in the -x, -y quadrant.
  * Enhanced libspiro to allow closed-loop spiros starting with '['
    or 'a' by seeking the first available 'v', 'c', or 'o' as start,
    which may be found later in the spiro curve. This was the least
    modification needed to allow call-test10 or call-test11 to pass.
  * Due to confusion created when ppedit was also re-licensed as MIT
    APACHE and GPL2+, it's necessary to re-clarify libspiro is GPL3+.
    In summary, GPL can include MIT code, MIT code cannot accept GPL.
    Please note code not in ppedit like libspiro's java is GNU GPL2+.
    Please note that libspiro's improvements or patches are also GPL.
  * Thanks to orbea for bugfixes concerning linking and linker flags,
    and removing .libs from linker path (some linkers don't like it).
  * Added more commenting in spiroentrypoints.h to clarify functions.
  * Reconfigured code to avoid exporting bezctx_intf.h since this is
    supposed to be internal to libspiro and not for external calling.
  * Also added https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Visibility to reduce exports.
  * SPIRO_INTERNAL_BEZCTX and call-test21.c added for simpler method
    of accessing libspiro for programs that only need the end result.
  * Test added for 'a','h' to ensure points don't overlap, else exit.

Sat Aug 15 21:50:34 UTC 2020 - Dirk Mueller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 20200505:
  * Bugfix for CVE-2019-19847 affecting {call-test14 to call-test19}.
  * Fix a memory access bug/error created earlier by patch 2017oct28
    Users using tagpoint libspiro20150702 are unaffected by this bug.
    Users using tagpoint libspiro20190731 are recommended to upgrade.
    Thanks to Frederic Cambus for calling attention to these faults.
  * Add optional 'end knot' for open curves (useful for displaying).
  * CRA Version also higher than so-bump 1.0.5 used on some distros;
    this maybe of interest to distros that bumped an earlier version.
  * Some garbage-in/garbage-out checks to verify we have 'ah' pairs,
    and we don't start with ']', or end with '['. Add libspiro.3 man.
  * Corrected set_di_to_x1y1() to use a constant bandwidth of 0.0005
  * Code improvements and bug fixes for better tagged/spiro results.
  * Several improvements added to further increase libspiro's speed.

Thu Dec 19 12:46:12 UTC 2019 - pgajdos@suse.com

- version update to 20190731
  * Scaling bug fixed. This allows libspiro to scale, and move spiro
    paths, therefore allowing users and/or programs the ability of
    using/making templates.
  * Additional spiro controls 'anchor' and 'handle' added.
  * Toggle switch ncq added, to allow further control of output results.

  * 2 Minor bug fixes caught on Coverity scan, free() and if c=3.
  * Re-edit lib and tests to be more accommodating of older compilers.
  * Verify libspiro output data is correct for test curves {0,1,2,4}.
