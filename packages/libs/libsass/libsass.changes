  Version 3.4.0
  -------------

  Over the last couple years we've worked very closely with the
  Ruby Sass team to reach Sass 3.4 compatibility.

  It's become clear that need to draw a line in sand with exactly
  how exactly we can match Sass 3.4, especially in the face of
  changes in Sass 3.5.

  With this release the LibSass team is marking the completion of
  active development on Sass 3.4 compatibility. From today we'll
  focus our efforts on Sass 3.5 compatibility, first prioritising
  CSS compatibility features like support for CSS custom property
  and CSS grids.  Improves to @at-root

  @at-root has mostly worked since it's introduction to LibSass but
  there have always been issue when it was combined with conditions
  (like @if) or mixins.  These issues were due to a fundamental
  difference in the LibSass implementation.  The difference has
  been addressed, so @at-root is now fully supported.

  You can read more about the specifics of this issue in #2089

    - Implement the Trace AST node (@xzyfer, #1585)
    - Remove the selector stack from the CSSize visitor (@xzyfer,
      #2091)
    - Workaround parent selector issues with at-root (@xzyfer,
      #2006 #2198)

  * Delayed Values

  Knowing when to evaluate a string, function, do concatenation, or
  perform math is a complicated problem with many edge cases.
  @mgreter has continued his work on improving the accuracy of
  these decisions.

    - Significant improvements to delayed values (@mgreter, #2042,
      #2034 #2057)
    - / interpreted as division instead of separator (@mgreter,
      #2149)
    - Mishandling quotes (@mgreter, #2153 #2156)

  * Continued improvements to @extend

  @extend is hard. With every release we get better at it and this
  release is no exception.

    - Extending inner of :not can lead to invalid css (@mgreter,
      #2054)
    - Segfault with @extend (@mgreter, #2051)
    - Extending a placeholder from a media query outputs nothing
      (@mgreter, #2150)
    - Don't drop pseudo elements in wrapped selectors (@xzyfer,
      #2200)

  * Memory improvments

  @mgreter has done some great work on improving our memory usage
  when dealing with large maps, and lists. He's not done yet, keep
  your eyes peeled for further improvments in upcomming releases.

    - Improve memory footprint when evaluating in loops (@mgreter,
      #2171)

  * Support list functions on maps

  Implementing Sass maps was my first major contribution to
  LibSass. A couple year later I can finally all the job complete
  with support for maps in list functions.

    - Support list functions on maps (@xzyfer, #1930)

  * Sourcemaps

  @mgreter and @nschonni have made some significant improvements to
  our sourcemaps. You can read more about the specifics in the bug

  Version 3.3.3
  -------------

  * Parser and rendering refactorings

    LibSass is now able to use stringification functions for its
    internal AST objects whenever its needed. Previously this was
    only possible when we had access to a context instance, which
    sometimes made it impossible to invoke the right code path.
    This tight coupling has been factored out and we can now use
    these more freely to get our output even closer to ruby sass.
    Parser now supports multiple operations without parentheses (a
    > b == c) correctly and an extensive generated test suite for
    > this feature was added to sass-spec.

  * Full support for variable arguments

    Since the introduction variable arguments in Sass 3.3 LibSass
    has been playing whack-a-mole with bug fixes. As of this
    release we should have argument handling compatible with the
    latest stable Ruby Sass. Thanks to @davidkpiano for his many
    detailed bug reports and his fantastic sassdash library whose
    extensive test suite helped make this possible.

  * Lots of bug-fixes

    There were two weeks of ongoing bug slaughtering by @mgreter
    after new-years eve, which resulted in over 80 closed issues
    (there are 117 closed github issues in total for this release).
    @xzyfer also had a good streak with 14 closed issues. Special
    thanks to @ksmadsen for his c++11 random_device fix.  Also a
    big thanks for our continuing contributors @am11 and @saper for
    their inputs, feedback and pull requests.

  * Improved spec tests

    With this release we have a bit more than 275 new spec tests.
    We started to include error tests too, which was quite
    difficult at the beginning, since we need to get the output
    100% correct to really pass a spec test, although we really
    only test the first line for error specs so far. None the less,
    with this release a lot more error messages are matching the
    ones of ruby sass and we also catch more cases. But we still
    let a lot more syntax silently pass than ruby sass does.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul 15 01:26:38 UTC 2016 - jengelh@inai.de

- Add libsass-am.diff, libsass-vers.diff to do proper versioning on
  shared library.
- Drop useless with-pic (only for â unbuilt â static libs)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul 13 07:38:21 UTC 2016 - psimons@suse.com
