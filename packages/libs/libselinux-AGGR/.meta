  <title>SELinux binary policy manipulation library</title>
  <description>Security-enhanced Linux is a feature of the Linux kernel and a number
of utilities with enhanced security functionality designed to add
mandatory access controls to Linux.  The Security-enhanced Linux
kernel contains new architectural components originally developed to
improve the security of the Flask operating system. These
architectural components provide general support for the enforcement
of many kinds of mandatory access control policies, including those
based on the concepts of Type Enforcement, Role-based Access
Control, and Multi-level Security.

libsemanage provides an API for the manipulation of SELinux binary policies.
It is used by checkpolicy (the policy compiler) and similar tools, as well
as by programs like load_policy that need to perform specific transformations
	  on binary policies such as customizing policy boolean settings.</description>
