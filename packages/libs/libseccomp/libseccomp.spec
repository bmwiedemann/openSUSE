%description
The libseccomp library provides an interface to the Linux Kernel's
syscall filtering mechanism, seccomp. The libseccomp API abstracts
away the underlying BPF-based syscall filter language and presents a
more conventional function-call based filtering interface.

%if "%{flavor}" == "python3"
This subpackage contains the python3 bindings for seccomp.
