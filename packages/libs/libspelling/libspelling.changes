- Update to version 0.3.0:
  + This is an unstable release for GNOME 47.beta.
  + The highlight for this release is a new threaded spellchecking
    engine. It performs text analysis and dictionary lookups in
    bulk off the UI thread. Care is taken to catch collisions in
    the face of user editing while spellchecking operations are in
    flight.
   + I expect a significant reduction in initial spellchecking time
     after opening a document. Opening `gtktextbuffer.c` in Text
     Editor was more than 8x faster.
   + Currently, libspelling relies on GTK main until 4.15.5 is
     released so do keep this in mind if you are a distributor.
   + Some API has changed, though that is unlikely to affect any
     known applications using libspelling.
   + Many new unit tests are part of the testsuite
   + SpellingLanguage was renamed to SpellingDictionary
   + SpellingLanguageInfo was renamed to SpellingLanguage
   + Various helpers were added to SpellingTextBufferAdapter so
     that they can update spelling menus. Applications that update
     the cursor position on clicks before showing menus may want to
     force the menu updating before `menu.popup`.
   + SpellingTextBufferAdapter now uses the new
     GtkTextBufferCommitNotify API in GTK 4.15.5 and newer.
