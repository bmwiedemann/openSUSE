Thu Jan 27 17:26:35 UTC 2022 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Stop packaging deprecated libbd_vdo2 and libbd_vdo-devel, via
  passing without-vdo to configure. Also add Obsoletes for both
  packages aswell as the 2 alternative package names they provided.
  Standalone vdo modules are deprecated in udisks2 since version
  2.9.0, and we have stopped building them there, and udisks2 was
  the only known consumer of libblockdevs vdo support, stop
  building them here also.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 26 08:34:04 UTC 2021 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Add -Wno-deprecated-declarations to cflags: dealing with
  deprecations is upstreams business and should not hinder
  downstream packages from building.

Wed Mar 28 03:13:10 UTC 2018 - luc14n0@linuxmail.org

- Resplit plugins to avoid pulling clusterlvm support by default
