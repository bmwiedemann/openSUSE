Fri Jun 30 10:16:53 UTC 2023 - Paolo Stivanin <info@paolostivanin.com>

- Update to 3.0.1:
  * New bugfix release of the libblockdev library with multiple
    fixes.
  * loop: Define LOOP_SET_BLOCK_SIZE is not defined. And remove
    bd_loop_get_autoclear definition.
  * crypto: Remove stray struct redefinition.
  * fs: Simplify struct BDFSInfo. And add missing copy and free
    functions to the header file.
  * vdo_stats: Remove unused libparted include.

    bd_lvm_vdolvpoolname. And add bd_lvm_segdata_copy/free to the
    header file.
  * Make the conf.d directory versioned.
- Changes from version 3.0.0:
  * New major release of the libblockdev library. This release
    contains a large API overhaul.
  * VDO a KBD plugins were removed.
  * New NVMe plugin was added.
  * Runtime dependencies are no longer checked during plugin
    initialization.
  * Part plugin was rewritten to use libfdisk instead of libparted
  * Crypto plugin API went through an extensive rewrite.
  * Support for new technologies was added to the crypto plugin:
    FileVault2 encryption, DM Integrity, LUKS2 tokens.
  * Filesystem plugin adds support for btrfs, F2FS, NILFS2, exFAT
    and UDF.
  * Support for new filesystem operations was added to the plugin:
    setting label and UUID, generic mkfs function and API for
    getting feature support for filesystems.
  * dmraid support was removed from the DM plugin.
  * Python 2 support was dropped.
- Drop no longer needed libblockdev-fix-libkmod-include.patch
- Drop no longer supported sub-packages with their dependencies,
  and their configure options, following upstream changes: python2
  (python-devel), bcache, dmraid (dmraid-devel BuildRequires) and
  kbd.
- Add (gcc >= 11 or gcc11) boolean BuildRequires to ensure the
  package is buildable on Leap 15.5, where the gcc meta-package is
  of version 7.
- Bump the SO version to 3 for the shared library and GI bindings
  sub-packages.
- Add ext2fs, fdisk, and libkeyutils pkgconfig() BuildRequires.
  The first is a new dependency for the FS plugin. The second, for
  the PART plugin. And the latter, for the CRYPTO plugin (before,
  the explicit_bzero() function would be searched for).
- Add libnvme-devel >= 1.3 BuildRequires, and pass --with-nvme to
  configure, needed for the NVMe plugin (new upstream addition).
- Pass --with-tools to configure, ensuring we keep building the
  libblockdev tools.

- Stop packaging deprecated libbd_vdo2 and libbd_vdo-devel, via
  passing without-vdo to configure. Also add Obsoletes for both
  packages aswell as the 2 alternative package names they provided.
  Standalone vdo modules are deprecated in udisks2 since version
  2.9.0, and we have stopped building them there, and udisks2 was
  the only known consumer of libblockdevs vdo support, stop
  building them here also.

Fri Mar 26 08:34:04 UTC 2021 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Add -Wno-deprecated-declarations to cflags: dealing with
  deprecations is upstreams business and should not hinder
  downstream packages from building.

Wed Mar 28 03:13:10 UTC 2018 - luc14n0@linuxmail.org

- Resplit plugins to avoid pulling clusterlvm support by default
  into the dependency chain (bsc#1086447).

  defaulting Python 3.
- Drop s390's plugin due to the lack of a file still not present
