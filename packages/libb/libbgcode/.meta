  <title>Prusa Block &amp; Binary G-code reader / writer / converter</title>
  <description>A new G-code file format featuring the following improvements over the legacy G-code:
1) Block structure with distinct blocks for metadata vs. G-code
2) Faster navigation
3) Coding &amp; compression for smaller file size
4) Checksum for data validity
5) Extensivity through new (custom) blocks. For example, a file signature block may be welcome by corporate customers.

bgcode is a command line application which allows to convert gcode files from ascii to binary format and viceversa.
