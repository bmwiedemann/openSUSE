with strong BSD origins, without needing to embed the same code over and
over again on each project.

The libbsd-ctor static library is required if setproctitle() is to be used
when libbsd is loaded via dlopen() from a threaded program.  This can be
configured using "pkg-config --libs libbsd-ctor".
