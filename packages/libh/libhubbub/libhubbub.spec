%description -n libhubbub0
Hubbub is an HTML5 compliant parsing library, written in C. It was
developed as part of the NetSurf project.

The HTML5 specification defines a parsing algorithm, based on the
behaviour of mainstream browsers, which provides instructions for how to
parse all markup, both valid and invalid. As a result, Hubbub parses web
content well.

Features:
* Parses HTML, good and bad
* Simple C API
* Fast
* Character encoding detection
* Well-tested (~90% test coverage)
* Portable
