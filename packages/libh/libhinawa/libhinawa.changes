- Update to version 2.2.0:
  * Some symbols are newly available as public API for new features.
  * HinawaFwResp::requested2 is added to deprecate HinawaFwResp::requested
  * Current implementation of HinawaFwResp::requested signal doesn't deliver
    all information in data of struct fw_cdev_event_request2 type.
    This is inconvenient for some applications bound to device which
    sends transactions to different addresses within a certain space.
    At release v2.1.0, nothing was added for error reporting of
    HinawaFwResp since it was not necessary. However, it's
    convenient to retrieve error reporting at failure of
    allocation in 1394 OHCI controller.
  * HinawaFwRespError enumeration is added and
    hinawa_fw_resp_error_quark() represents the domain of GError
    with the code in enumeration.
