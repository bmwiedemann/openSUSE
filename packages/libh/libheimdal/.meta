  <title>Libraries of Kerberos 5 implementation</title>
  <description>Heimdal is an implementation of Kerberos 5 (and some more stuff) largely written
in Sweden (which was important when we started writing it, less so now).
It is freely available under a three clause BSD style license.

Other free implementations include the one from MIT, and Shishi.
Also Microsoft Windows and Sun's Java come with implementations of Kerberos.

This package only provides libraries and devel files (binaries have been removed),
libraries are required by 64bit package of ICAClient version 13.2.</description>
