- Update to version 7.7.0
  + Bug fixes:
    - PKCS#11 hcrypto back-end:
      + initialize the p11_module_load function list
      + verify that not only is a mechanism present but that its
        mechanism info states that it offers the required
        encryption, decryption or digest services
    - krb5:
      + Starting with 7.6, Heimdal permitted requesting
        authenticated anonymous tickets. However, it did not
        verify that a KDC in fact returned an anonymous ticket
        when one was requested.
      + Cease setting the KDCOption reaquest_anonymous flag when
        issuing S4UProxy (constrained delegation) TGS requests.
      + when the Win2K PKINIT compatibility option is set, do not
        require krbtgt otherName to match when validating KDC
        certificate.
      + set PKINIT_BTMM flag per Apple implementation
      + use memset_s() instead of memset()
    - kdc:
      + When generating KRB5SignedPath in the AS, use the reply
        client name rather than the one from the request, so
        validation will work correctly in the TGS.
      + allow checksum of PA-FOR-USER to be HMAC_MD5. Even if TGT
        used an enctype with a different checksum. Per [MS-SFU]
        2.2.1 PA-FOR-USER the checksum is always HMAC_MD5, and
        that's what Windows and MIT clients send.
        In Heimdal both the client and kdc use instead the
        checksum of the TGT, and therefore work with each other
        but Windows and MIT clients fail against Heimdal KDC.
        Both Windows and MIT KDC would allow any keyed checksum
        to be used so Heimdal client work fine against it.
        Change Heimdal KDC to allow HMAC_MD5 even for non RC4
        based TGT in order to support per-spec clients.
      + use memset_s() instead of memset()
      + Detect Heimdal 1.0 through 7.6 clients that issue
        S4UProxy (constrained delegation) TGS Requests with the
        request anonymous flag set. These requests will be
        treated as S4UProxy requests and not anonymous requests.
    - HDB:
      + Set SQLite3 backend default page size to 8KB.
      + Add hdb_set_sync() method
    - kadmind:
      + disable HDB sync during database load avoiding
        unnecessary disk i/o.
    - ipropd:
      + disable HDB sync during receive_everything. Doing an
        fsync per-record when receiving the complete HDB is a
        performance disaster. Among other things, if the HDB is
        very large, then one slave receving a full HDB can cause
        other slaves to timeout and, if HDB write activity is
        high enough to cause iprop log truncation, then also need
        full syncs, which leads to a cycle of full syncs for all
        slaves until HDB write activity drops.
        Allowing the iprop log to be larger helps, but improving
        receive_everything() performance helps even more.
    - kinit:
      + Anonymous PKINIT tickets discard the realm information
        used to locate the issuing AS. Store the issuing realm in
        the credentials cache in order to locate a KDC which can
        renew them.
      + Do not leak the result of krb5_cc_get_config() when
        determining anonymous PKINIT start realm.
    - klist:
      + Show transited-policy-checked, ok-as-delegate and
        anonymous flags when listing credentials.
    - tests:
      + Regenerate certs so that they expire before the 2038
        armageddon so the test suite will pass on 32-bit
        operating systems until the underlying issues can be
        resolved.
    - Solaris:
      + Define _STDC_C11_BCI for memset_s prototype
    - build tooling:
      + Convert from python 2 to python 3
    - documentation:
      + rename verify-password to verify-password-quality
      + hprop default mode is encrypt
      + kadmind "all" permission does not include "get-keys"
      + verify-password-quality might not be stateless

- Version 7.6.0
  + Security (#555):
    - CVE-2018-16860 Heimdal KDC: Reject PA-S4U2Self with unkeyed
      checksum
      When the Heimdal KDC checks the checksum that is placed on
      the S4U2Self packet by the server to protect the requested
      principal against modification, it does not confirm that
      the checksum algorithm that protects the user name
      (principal) in the request is keyed. This allows a
      man-in-the-middle attacker who can intercept the request to
      the KDC to modify the packet by replacing the user name
      (principal) in the request with any desired user name
      (principal) that exists in the KDC and replace the checksum
      protecting that name with a CRC32 checksum (which requires
      no prior knowledge to compute).
      This would allow a S4U2Self ticket requested on behalf of
      user name (principal) user@EXAMPLE.COM to any service to be
      changed to a S4U2Self ticket with a user name (principal) of
      Administrator@EXAMPLE.COM. This ticket would then contain
      the PAC of the modified user name (principal).

    - CVE-2019-12098, client-only:
      RFC8062 Section 7 requires verification of the PA-PKINIT-KX
      key exchange when anonymous PKINIT is used. Failure to do
      so can permit an active attacker to become a
      man-in-the-middle.
  + Bug fixes:
    - Happy eyeballs: Don't wait for responses from
      known-unreachable KDCs.
    - kdc:
      + check return copy_Realm, copy_PrincipalName,
        copy_EncryptionKey
    - kinit:
      + cleanup temporary ccaches
      + see man page for "kinit --anonymous" command line syntax
        change
    - kdc:
      + Make anonymous AS-requests more RFC8062-compliant.
        Updated expired test certificates
    - Solaris:
      + PKCS#11 hcrypto backend broken since 7.0.1
      + Building with Sun Pro C
  + Features:
    - kuser: support authenticated anonymous AS-REQs in kinit
    - kdc: support for anonymous TGS-REQs
    - kgetcred support for anonymous service tickets
    - Support builds with OpenSSL 1.1.1
- fixed heimdal-patched.diff and reproducible.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug  7 06:22:33 UTC 2018 - bwiedemann@suse.com

Fri Dec 29 13:16:21 UTC 2017 - joerg.lorenzen@ki.tng.de

- Update to version 7.5.0
  - Security
    - Fix CVE-2017-17439, which is a remote denial of service
      vulnerability:
      In Heimdal 7.1 through 7.4, remote unauthenticated attackers
      are able to crash the KDC by sending a crafted UDP packet
      containing empty data fields for client name or realm.
  - Bug fixes
    - Handle long input lines when reloading database dumps.
    - In pre-forked mode (default on Unix), correctly clear the
      process ids of exited children, allowing new child processes
      to replace the old.
    - Fixed incorrect KDC response when no-cross realm TGT exists,
      allowing client requests to fail quickly rather than time
      out after trying to get a correct answer from each KDC.
- Fixed heimdal-patched.diff.
- Removed Avoid_NULL_structure_pointer_member_dereference.patch,
  fixed upstream.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec 07 15:17:23 UTC 2017 - joerg.lorenzen@ki.tng.de

- Added Avoid_NULL_structure_pointer_member_dereference.patch,
  fixes (bsc#1071675).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug 03 20:25:45 UTC 2017 - joerg.lorenzen@ki.tng.de

- Update to version 7.4.0
  - Security
    - Fix CVE-2017-11103: Orpheus' Lyre KDC-REP service name
      validation.
      This is a critical vulnerability.
      In _krb5_extract_ticket() the KDC-REP service name must be
      obtained from encrypted version stored in 'enc_part' instead
      of the unencrypted version stored in 'ticket'.
      Use of the unecrypted version provides an opportunity for
      successful server impersonation and other attacks.
      Identified by Jeffrey Altman, Viktor Duchovni and
      Nico Williams.
      See https://www.orpheus-lyre.info/ for more details.
- Fixed heimdal-patched.diff.

Thu Jun 15 20:52:17 UTC 2017 - joerg.lorenzen@ki.tng.de

- Update to version 7.3.0
  - Security
    + Fix transit path validation. Commit f469fc6 (2010-10-02)
      inadvertently caused the previous hop realm to not be added
      to the transit path of issued tickets. This may, in some
      cases, enable bypass of capath policy in Heimdal versions 1.5
      through 7.2.
      Note, this may break sites that rely on the bug. With the bug
      some incomplete [capaths] worked, that should not have.
      These may now break authentication in some cross-realm
      configurations. (CVE-2017-6594)
- Version 7.2.0
  - Bug fixes
    + Portability improvements.
    + More strict parsing of encoded URI components in HTTP KDC.
    + Fixed memory leak in malloc error recovery in NTLM GSSAPI
      mechanism.
    + Avoid overly specific CPU info in krb5-config in aid of
      reproducible builds.
    + Don't do AFS string-to-key tests when feature is disabled.
    + Skip mdb_stat test when the command is not available.
    + Windows: update SHA2 timestamp server.
    + hdb: add missing export 
      hdb_generate_key_set_password_with_ks_tuple.
    + Fix signature of hdb_generate_key_set_password().
    + Windows: enable KX509 support in the KDC.
    + kdc: fix kx509 service principal match.
    + iprop: handle case where master sends nothing new.
    + ipropd-slave: fix incorrect error codes.
    + Allow choice of sqlite for HDB pref.
    + check-iprop: don't fail to kill daemons.
    + roken: pidfile -> rk_pidfile.
    + kdc: _kdc_do_kx509 fix use after free error.
    + Do not detect x32 as 64-bit platform.
    + No sys/ttydefaults.h on CYGWIN.
    + Fix check-iprop races.
    + roken_detach_prep() close pipe.
