  <title>Useful collection of routines for C and C++ programming</title>
  <description>libHX is a C library (with some C++ bindings available) that provides
data structures and functions commonly needed, such as maps, deques,
linked lists, string formatting and autoresizing, option and config
file parsing, type checking casts and more.

libHX aids in quickly writing up C and C++ data processing programs,
by consolidating tasks that often happen to be open-coded, such as
(simple) config file reading, option parsing, directory traversal,
and others, into a library. The focus is on reducing the amount of
time (and secondarily, the amount of code) a developer has to spend
for otherwise implementing such.</description>
