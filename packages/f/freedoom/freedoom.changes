- Update to 0.12.1
  * The manual is now rendered as PDF.
  * Final Doom compatibility de-emphasized. Where it creates
    conflicts with Doom II mods or texture definitions, the the
    Doom II side of things gets preferred. Final Doom-specific
    maps and mods may never look completely right in Freedoom, as
    a result.
  * Phase 1 received a lot of mapping changes with improved
    difficulty levels. There is a new C3M5.
  * Phase 2 MAP01 received an overhaul, simplifying its design in
    significant ways to improve the flow around the level.
  * Two maps in Phase 2 were replaced due to being recreations of
    Doom II maps.
  * Maps in Phase 2 in general have had some slight
    re-arrangement based on difficulty levels and themes. A new
    MAP06 is included, while the old one took the MAP18 slot.
  * All levels are now guaranteed to have co-op and deathmatch starts.
  * New sprites for power-ups (stealth, overdrive, and ultra-overdrive)
    and Arch Vile.
  * Some weapon and ammo sprites have been tweaked and improved.
  * Completed and enhanced set of Evilution and Plutonia textures.
  * New skull-switches by MissLav.
  * New SKY4 based on an astronomy photograph.
  * Tweaked player sprites and HUD face.
  * New music tracks in C1M2, C2M3, C2M8, MAP03, MAP12, MAP22,
    MAP25, MAP26, MAP27, DM03, DM06, DM09, DM17, DM24, DM31, and
    DM32.
  * Metainfo (formerly appdata) and desktop files have been
    brought up to the latest standard specifications and
    recommendations, using reverse-DNS for the project
    identifier, and a self-evaluated content rating.
  * Phase 2’s internal DEMO1 has been replaced, thanks to some
    odd vanilla quirks that could cause it to desync in some (but
    not all) conditions.
  * The sailor monster type is formally banished from Freedoom’s
    own levels, and remaining uses of it were removed.

    art-derived ones.

    leftover Boom specials, and it should no longer be possible
    to get stuck between a rock and a tree in Phase 1 C1M1.
  * Brand new Phase 1 C3M1, replacing an old Doom-inspired level.
  * Widescreen statusbar for ZDoom was removed. This created
    incompatibility with some mods.
  * Fixed intermission text after using the secret exit in
    Phase 2 MAP31, where obituary texts were incorrectly
    displayed instead.
- Update to new upstream release 0.11.2 (2017-03-15)
