  <title>Replacement game files for Doom game engines</title>
  <description>A set of game resources for the DOOM game engine.  While the Doom source code
is Free, you currently still need one of the proprietary IWAD files from id in
order to play Doom. Freedoom aims to create a Free alternative. Combined with
the GPL-licensed Doom source code this will result in a completely Free
Doom-based game.</description>
