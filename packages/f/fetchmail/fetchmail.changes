Mon Dec 27 16:50:06 UTC 2021 - David Anes <david.anes@suse.com>

- update to 6.5.26:
  * When using wolfSSL 5.0.0, work around a bug that appears to hit wolfSSL when
  receiving handshake records while still in SSL_peek(). Workaround is to read
  1 byte and cache it, then call SSL_peek() again. This affects only some servers.
  * New serbian translation.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Dec 11 23:23:50 UTC 2021 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 6.5.25:
  * 6.4.24's workaround for OpenSSL 1.0.2's X509_V_FLAG_TRUSTED_FIRST flag
    contained a typo and would not kick in properly.
  * Library and/or rpath setting from configure.ac was fixed.
  * Added an example systemd unit file and instructions to contrib/systemd/
    which runs fetchmail as a daemon with 5-minute poll intervals.
  * fetchmail can now be used with wolfSSL 5's OpenSSL compatibility layer,
    see INSTALL and README.SSL. This is considered experimental.
    Feedback solicited.
  * Bison 3.8 dropped yytoknum altogether, breaking compilation due to a
    warning workaround. Remove the cast of yytoknum to void.  This may cause
    a compiler warning to reappear with older Bison versions.
  * OpenSSL 1.0.2: Workaround for systems that keep the expired DST Root CA X3 
    certificate in its trust store because OpenSSL by default prefers the 
    untrusted certificate and fails.
  * For common ssh-based IMAP PREAUTH setups (i. e. those that use a plugin
    - no matter its contents - and that set auth ssh), change the STARTTLS 
    error message to suggest sslproto '' instead.
    This is a commonly reported issue after the CVE-2021-39272 fix in 6.4.22.

Wed Oct  6 15:00:19 UTC 2021 - Pedro Monreal <pmonreal@suse.com>

- Update to 6.4.22: [bsc#1190069, CVE-2021-39272]
  * OPENSSL AND LICENSING NOTE:
    - fetchmail 6.4.22 is compatible with OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 3.0.0.
      OpenSSL's licensing changed between these releases from dual
      OpenSSL/SSLeay license to Apache License v2.0, which is
      considered incompatible with GPL v2 by the FSF. For
      implications and details, see the file COPYING.
  * SECURITY FIXES:
    - CVE-2021-39272: fetchmail-SA-2021-02: On IMAP connections,
      without --ssl and with nonempty --sslproto, meaning that
      fetchmail is to enforce TLS, and when the server or an attacker
      sends a PREAUTH greeting, fetchmail used to continue an
      unencrypted connection. Now, log the error and abort the
      connection. --Recommendation for servers that support
      SSL/TLS-wrapped or "implicit" mode on a dedicated port
      (default 993): use --ssl, or the ssl user option in an rcfile.
    - On IMAP and POP3 connections, --auth ssh no longer prevents
      STARTTLS negotiation.
    - On IMAP connections, fetchmail does not permit overriding
      a server-side LOGINDISABLED with --auth password any more.
    - On POP3 connections, the possibility for RPA authentication
      (by probing with an AUTH command without arguments) no longer
      prevents STARTTLS negotiation.
    - For POP3 connections, only attempt RPA if the authentication
      type is "any".
  * BUG FIXES:
    - On IMAP connections, when AUTHENTICATE EXTERNAL fails and we
      have received the tagged (= final) response, do not send "*".
    - On IMAP connections, AUTHENTICATE EXTERNAL without username
      will properly send a "=" for protocol compliance.
    - On IMAP connections, AUTHENTICATE EXTERNAL will now check if
      the server advertised SASL-IR (RFC-4959) support and otherwise
      refuse (fetchmail <= 6.4 has not supported and does not support
      the separate challenge/response with command continuation)
    - On IMAP connections, when --auth external is requested but not
      advertised by the server, log a proper error message.
    - Fetchmail no longer crashes when attempting a connection with
      --plugin "" or --plugout "".
    - Fetchmail no longer leaks memory when processing the arguments
      of --plugin or --plugout on connections.
    - On POP3 connections, the CAPAbilities parser is now caseblind.
    - Fix segfault on configurations with "defaults ... no envelope".
      This is a regression in fetchmail 6.4.3 and happened when
      plugging memory leaks, which did not account for that the
      envelope parameter is special when set as "no envelope". The
      segfault happens in a constant strlen(-1), triggered by trusted
      local input => no vulnerability.
    - Fix program abort (SIGABRT) with "internal error" when invalid
      sslproto is given with OpenSSL 1.1.0 API compatible SSL
      implementations.
  * CHANGES:
    - IMAP: When fetchmail is in not-authenticated state and the server
      volunteers CAPABILITY information, use it and do not re-probe.
      (After STARTTLS, fetchmail must and will re-probe explicitly.)
    - For typical POP3/IMAP ports 110, 143, 993, 995, if port and --ssl
      option do not match, emit a warning and continue.
    - fetchmail.man and README.SSL were updated in line with
      RFC-8314/8996/8997 recommendations to prefer Implicit TLS
      (--ssl/ssl) and TLS v1.2 or newer, placing --sslproto tls1.2+
      more prominently. The defaults shall not change between 6.4.X
      releases for compatibility.

- Update to 6.4.21:
  * REGRESSION FIX: The new security fix in 6.4.20 for
    CVE-2021-36386 caused truncation of messages logged to
    buffered outputs, predominantly --logfile.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul 29 07:57:07 UTC 2021 - Pedro Monreal <pmonreal@suse.com>

- Update to 6.4.20: [bsc#1188875, CVE-2021-36386]
  * CVE-2021-36386: DoS or information disclosure in some configurations.
    When a log message exceeds c. 2 kByte in size, for instance,
    with very long header contents, and depending on verbosity
    option, fetchmail can crash or misreport each first log message
    that requires a buffer reallocation. fetchmail then reallocates
    memory and re-runs vsnprintf() without another call to va_start(),
    so it reads garbage. The exact impact depends on many factors
    around the compiler and operating system configurations used and
    the implementation details of the stdarg.h interfaces of the two
    functions mentioned before.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Sat May  8 19:55:09 UTC 2021 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 6.4.19:
  * fetchmailconf: properly catch and report option parsing errors
  * LMTP: do not try to validate the last component of a UNIX-domain LMTP socket 
    as though it were a TCP port.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr  6 02:13:46 UTC 2021 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 6.4.18:
  * fetchmailconf: fetchmail 6.4.16 added --sslcertfile to the configuration dump,
    but fetchmailconf support was incomplete in Git 7349f124 and it could not
    parse sslcertfile, thus the user settings editor came up empty with console
    errors printed.  Fix configuration parser in fetchmailconf.
  * fetchmailconf: do not require fetchmail for -V. do not require Tk (Tkinter)
    for -d option. This is to fail more gracefully on incomplete installs.
  * TLS code: remove OPENSSL_NO_DEPRECATED macros to avoid portability issues
    with OpenSSL v3 - these are for development purposes, not production.
  * TLS futureproofing: use SSL_use_PrivateKey_file instead of 
    SSL_use_RSAPrivateKey_file, the latter will be deprecated with OpenSSL v3,
    and the user's key file might be something else than RSA.
  * IMAP client: it used to leak memory for username and password when trying
    the LOGIN (password-based) authentication and encountered a timeout situation.
  * dist-tools/getstats.py: also counts lines in *.py files, shown above.
  * fetchmail.man: now mentions that you may need to add --ssl when specifying
    a TLS-wrapped port.
  * fetchmailconf: --version (-V) now prints the Python version in use.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar  1 07:51:03 UTC 2021 - Pedro Monreal <pmonreal@suse.com>

- update to 6.4.16:
  * fetchmail's --configdump, and fetchmailconf, lacked support for
    the sslcertfile option.
  * fetchmail --version [fetchmail -V] now queries and prints the
    SSL/TLS library's "SSL default trusted certificate" file or
    directory (mind the word "default"), where the OpenSSL-compatible
    TLS implementation will look for trusted root, meaning
    certification authority (CA), certificates.
  * fetchmail --version now prints version of the OpenSSL library
    that it was compiled against, and that it is using at runtime,
    and also the OPENSSL_DIR and OPENSSL_ENGINES_DIR (if available).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan  4 10:28:06 UTC 2021 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 6.4.15:
  * Fix a typo in the manual page reported by David McKelvie.
  * Fix cross-compilation with openssl, by Fabrice Fontaine. Merge request !23.
  * Fix truncation of SMTP PLAIN AUTH with ^ in credentials, by Earl Chew.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Dec 19 09:52:39 UTC 2020 - Dirk Mueller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 6.4.14:
  * sr:    Мирослав Николић (Miroslav Nikolić) [Serbian]
  * Errors about lock file (= pidfile) creation could be lost in daemon 
  configurations (-d option, or set daemon) when using syslog. Now they are also 
  logged to syslog.  Found verifying a pidfile creation issue on 6.4.12 that was 
  previously reported by Alex Hall of Automatic Distributors.
  * If the lock file cannot be removed (no write permission on directory), try
  to truncate it, and if that fails, report error.
  * If the pidfile was non-default, fetchmail -q or --quit would malfunction and
  claim no other fetchmail were running, because it did not read the 
  configuration files or merge the command line options, thus it would look for 
  the PID in the wrong file.

Fri Sep  4 20:22:16 UTC 2020 - Dirk Mueller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 6.4.12:
  # REGRESSION FIX:
  * configure: fetchmail 6.4.9 and 6.4.10 would miss checking for TLS v1.2 and
  TLS v1.3 support if AC_LIB_LINKFLAGS came up with something such as
  /path/to/libssl.so, rather than -lssl. (For instance on FreeBSD) 
  * configure: fetchmail 6.4.9's configure was unable to pick up OpenSSL
  if it wasn't announced by pkg-config, for instance, on FreeBSD

- update to 6.4.8:
  * Add a test program fm_realpath, and a t.realpath script, neither to be
    installed. These will test resolution of the current working directory.
  * TRANSLATION UPDATES
  * Plug memory leaks when parts of the configuration (defaults, rcfile, command 
    line) override one another.
  * fetchmail terminated the placeholder command string too late and included
    garbage from the heap at the end of the string. Workaround: don't use place-
    holders %h or %p in the --plugin string. Bug added in 6.4.0 when merging
    Gitlab merge request !5 in order to fix an input buffer overrun.
    Faulty commit 418cda65f752e367fa663fd13884a45fcbc39ddd.
  * Fetchmail now checks for errors when trying to read the .idfile
  * Fetchmail's error messages that reports that the defaults entry isn't the 
    first was made more precise. It could be misleading if there was a poll or
    skip statement before the defaults.
  * Fetchmail documentation was updated to require OpenSSL 1.1.1.
    OpenSSL 1.0.2 reached End Of Life status at the end of the year 2019.
    Fetchmail will tolerate, but warn about, 1.0.2 for now on the assumption that 
    distributors backport security fixes as the need arises.
    Fetchmail will also warn if another SSL library that is API-compatible
    with OpenSSL lacks TLS v1.3 support.
  * If the trust anchor is missing, fetchmail refers the user to README.SSL.
  * The AC_DECLS(getenv) check was removed, its only user was broken and not 
    accounting for that AC_DECLS always defines HAVE_DECL_... to 0 or 1, so
    fetchmail never declared a missing getenv() symbol (it was testing with 
    #ifdef).  Remove the backup declaration. getenv is mandated by SUSv2 anyways.
  * fetchmailconf now supports Python 3 and currently requires the "future" 
    package, see https://pypi.org/project/future/.
  * fetchmailconf: The minimum supported version is now Python 2.7.13, but it is 
    recommended to use at least 2.7.16 (due to its massive SSL updates).
    Older Python versions may check SSL certificates not strictly enough,
    which may cause fetchmail to complain later, if the certificate verify fails.
  * fetchmailconf now autoprobes SSL-wrapped connections (ports 993 and 995 for 
    IMAP and POP3) as well and by preference.
  * fetchmailconf now defaults newly created users to "ssl" if either of the
    existing users sets ssl, or if the server has freshly been probed and
    found supporting ssl.
    There is a caveat: adding a user to an existing server without probing it
    again may skip adding ssl. (This does not prevent STARTTLS.)
  * Fix three bugs in fetchmail.man (one unterminated string to .IP macro, one
    line that ran into a .PP macro, .TH date format), and remove one .br request 
    from inside the table, which is unsupported by FreeBSD 12's mandoc(1) formatter.
  * Further man page fixes and additions by Chris Mayo and Gregor Zattler.
  * When evaluating the need for STARTTLS in non-default configurations (SSL 
    certificate validation turned off), fetchmail would only consider --sslproto 
    tls1 as requiring STARTTLS, now all non-empty protocol versions do.
  * fetchmailconf now properly writes "no sslcertck" if sslcertck is disabled.
  * fetchmailconf now catches and reports OS errors (including DNS errors) when 
    autoprobing.
  * fetchmailconf received a host of other bugfixes, see the Git commit log.

- Update to 6.4.1 [bsc#1152964]
  ## REGRESSION FIXES:
  * The bug fix Debian Bug#941129 was incomplete and caused
    - a regression in the default file locations, so that fetchmail was
      no longer able to find its configuration files in some situations.
    - a regression under _FORTIFY_SOURCE where PATH_MAX > minimal _POSIX_PATH_MAX.

- Update to 6.4.0
  ## SECURITY FIXES THAT AFFECT BEHAVIOUR AND MAY REQUIRE RECONFIGURATION
  * Fetchmail no longer supports SSLv2.
  * Fetchmail no longer attempts to negotiate SSLv3 by default,
    even with --sslproto ssl23. Fetchmail can now use SSLv3, or TLSv1.1 or a newer
    TLS version, with STLS/STARTTLS (it would previously force TLSv1.0 with
    STARTTLS).  If the OpenSSL version used at build and run-time supports these
    versions, --sslproto ssl3 and --sslproto ssl3+ can be used to re-enable SSLv3.
    Doing so is discouraged because the SSLv3 protocol is broken.
    While this change is supposed to be compatible with common configurations,
    users may have to and are advised to change all explicit --sslproto ssl2
    (change to newer protocols required), --sslproto ssl3, --sslproto tls1 to
    --sslproto auto, so that they can benefit from TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2 where
    supported by the server.
    The --sslproto option now understands the values auto, ssl3+, tls1+, tls1.1,
    tls1.1+, tls1.2, tls1.2+, tls1.3, tls1.3+ (case insensitively), see CHANGES
    below for details.
  * Fetchmail defaults to --sslcertck behaviour. A new option --nosslcertck to
    override this has been added, but may be removed in future fetchmail versions
    in favour of another configuration option that makes the insecurity in using
    this option clearer.
  ## SECURITY FIXES
  * Fetchmail prevents buffer overruns in GSSAPI authentication with user names
    beyond c. 6000 characters in length. Reported by Greg Hudson.
  ## CHANGED REQUIREMENTS
  * fetchmail 6.4.0 is written in C99 and requires a SUSv3 (Single Unix
    Specification v3, a superset of POSIX.1-2001 aka. IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 with
    XSI extension) compliant system. For now, a C89 compiler should also work
    if the system is SUSv3 compliant.
    In particular, older fetchmail versions had workaround for several functions
    standardized in the Single Unix Specification v3, these have been removed.
    The trio/ library has been removed from the distribution.
  ## CHANGES
  * fetchmail 6.3.X is unsupported.
  * fetchmail now configures OpenSSL support by default.
  * fetchmail now requires OpenSSL v1.0.2 or newer.
  * Fetchmail now supports --sslproto auto and --sslproto tls1+ (same as ssl23).
  * --sslproto tls1.1+, tls1.2+, and tls1.3+ are now supported for
    auto-negotiation with a minimum specified TLS protocol version, and --sslproto
    tls1.1, --sslproto tls1.2 and --sslproto tls1.3 to force the specified TLS
    protocol version. Note that tls1.3 requires OpenSSL v1.1.1 or newer.
  * Fetchmail now detects if the server hangs up prematurely during SSL_connect()
    and reports this condition as such, and not just as SSL connection failure.
    (OpenSSL 1.0.2 reported incompatible with pop3.live.com by Jerry Seibert).
  * A foreground fetchmail can now accept a few more options while another copy is
    running in the background.
  * fetchmail now handles POP3 --keep UID lists more efficiently, by using Rainer
    Weikusat's P-Tree implementation. This reduces the complexity for handling
    a large UIDL from O(n^2) to O(n log n) and becomes noticably faster with
    thousands of kept messages. (IMAP does not currently track UIDs and is unaffected.)
    At the same time, the UIDL emulation code for deficient servers has been
    removed. It never worked really well.  Servers that do not implement the
    optional UIDL command only work with --fetchall option set, which in itself is
    incompatible with the --keep option (it would cause message duplication).
  * fetchmail, when setting up TLS connections, now uses SSL_set_tlsext_host_name()
    to set up the SNI (Server Name Indication). Some servers (for instance
    googlemail) require SNI when using newer SSL protocols.
  * Fetchmail now sets the expected hostname through OpenSSL 1.0.2's new 
    X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_host() function to enable OpenSSL's native certificate
    verification features.
  * fetchmail will drop the connection when fetching with IMAP and receiving an
    unexpected untagged "* BYE" response, to work around certain faulty servers.
  * The FETCHMAIL_POP3_FORCE_RETR environment variable is now documented,
    it forces fetchmail, when talking POP3, to always use the RETR command,
    even if it would otherwise use the TOP command.
  * Fetchmail's configure stage will try to query pkg-config or pkgconf for libssl
    and libcrypto, in case other system use .pc files to document specific library dependencies.
  * The gethostbyname() API calls and compatibility functions have been removed.
  * These translations are shipped but not installed by default because
    they have less than 500 translated messages out of 714: el fi gl pt_BR sk tr
    -> Greek, Finnish, Galician, Brazilian Portuguese, Slovak, Turkish.
  * Fetchmail now refuses delivery if the MDA option contains single-quoted expansions.
  ## FIXES
  * Do not translate header tags such as "Subject:".
  * Convert most links from berlios.de to sourceforge.net.
  * Report error to stderr, and exit, if --idle is combined with multiple  accounts.
  * Point to --idle from GENERAL OPERATION to clarify --idle and multiple  mailboxes do not mix.
  * Fix SSL-enabled build on systems that do not declare SSLv3_client_method(),
    or that #define OPENSSL_NO_SSL3 inside #include <openssl/ssl.h>
  * Version report lists -SSLv3 on SSL-enabled no-ssl3 builds.
  * Fetchmail no longer adds a NUL byte to the username in GSSAPI authentication.
    This was reported to break Kerberos-based authentication with Microsoft Exchange 2013
  * Set umask properly before writing the .fetchids file, to avoid failing the
    security check on the next run.
  * When forwarding by LMTP, also check antispam response code when collecting
    the responses after the CR LF . CR LF sequence at the end of the DATA phase.
  * fetchmail will not try other protocols after a socket error. This avoids mismatches
    of how different prococols see messages as "seen" and re-fetches of known mail.
  * fetchmail no longer reports "System error during SSL_connect(): Success."
  * fetchmailconf would ignore Edit or Delete actions on the first (topmost)
    item in a list (no matter if server list, user list, ...).
  * The mimedecode feature now properly detects multipart/mixed-type matches, so
    that quoted-printable-encoded multipart messages can get decoded.
    (Regression in 5.0.0 on 1999-03-27, as a side effect of a PGP-mimedecode fix
    attributed to Henrik Storner.)
  * FETCHMAILHOME can now safely be a relative path, which will be qualified
    through realpath(). Previously, it had to be absolute in daemon mode.
  ## KNOWN BUGS AND WORKAROUNDS
    (This section floats upwards through the NEWS file so it stays with the
    current release information)
  * Fetchmail does not handle messages without Message-ID header well
    (See sourceforge.net bug #780933)
  * Fetchmail currently uses 31-bit signed integers in several places
    where unsigned and/or wider types should have been used, for instance,
    for mailbox sizes, and misreports sizes of 2 GibiB and beyond. 
    Fixing this requires C89 compatibility to be relinquished.
  * BSMTP is mostly untested and errors can cause corrupt output.
  * Sun Workshop 6 (SPARC) is known to miscompile the configuration file lexer in
    64-bit mode.  Either compile 32-bit code or use GCC to compile 64-bit fetchmail.
  * Fetchmail does not track pending deletes across crashes.
  * The command line interface is sometimes a bit stubborn, for instance,
    fetchmail -s doesn't work with a daemon running.
  * Linux systems may return duplicates of an IP address in some circumstances if
    no or no global IPv6 addresses are configured.
    (No workaround. Ubuntu Bug#582585, Novell Bug#606980.)
  * Kerberos 5 may be broken, particularly on Heimdal, and provide bogus error
    messages. This will not be fixed, because the maintainer has no Kerberos 5
    server to test against. Use GSSAPI.

  # CRITICAL BUG FIX for setups using "mimedecode":
  * The mimedecode feature failed to ship the last line of the body if it was
    encoded as quoted-printable and had a MIME soft line break in the very last
    line.  Reported by Lars Hecking in June 2011.
  * Bug introduced on 1998-03-20 when the mimedecode support was added by ESR
    before release 4.4.1 through code contributed by Henrik Storner.
    Workaround for older releases: do not use mimedecode feature.
  * Earlier versions of this NEWS file claimed this bug fixed in fetchmail-6.3.23,
    but it was not.
  * Fixes Launchpad Bug#1171818.

# CRITICAL AND REGRESSION FIXES
* Plug a memory leak in OpenSSL's certificate verification callback.
  This would affect fetchmail configurations running with SSL in daemon mode
  more than one-shot runs.
  Reported by Erik Thiele, and pinned by Dominik Heeg,
  fixes Debian Bug #688015.
  This bug was introduced into fetchmail 6.3.0 (committed 2005-10-29)
  when support for subjectAltName was added through a patch by Roland
  Stigge, submitted as Debian Bug#201113.

* The --logfile option now works again outside daemon mode, reported by Heinz
  Diehl. The documentation that I had been reading was inconsistent with the
  code, and only parts of the manual page claimed that --logfile was only
  effective in daemon mode.

# BUG FIXES
* Fix a memory leak in out-of-memory error condition while handling plugins.
  Report and patch by John Beck (found with Parfait static code analyzer).
* Fix a NULL pointer dereference in out-of-memory error condition while handling
  plugins.
  Report and patch by John Beck (found with Parfait static code analyzer).

# CHANGES
* Improved reporting when SSL/TLS X.509 certificate validation has failed,
  working around a not-so-recent swapping of two OpenSSL error codes, and
  a practical impossibility to distinguish broken certification chains from
  missing trust anchors (root certificates).
* OpenSSL decoded errors are now reported through report(), rather than dumped
  to stderr, so that they should show up in logfiles and/or syslog.
* The fetchmail manual page no longer claims that MD5 were the default OpenSSL
  hash format (for use with --sslfingerprint). Reported by Jakob Wilk,
  PARTIAL fix for Debian Bug#700266.
* The fetchmail manual page now refers the user to --softbounce from the
  SMTP/ESMTP ERROR HANDLING section.  Reported by Anton Shterenlikht.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- update to 6.3.23
# REGRESSION FIXES
* Fix compilation with OpenSSL implementations before 0.9.8m that lack
  SSL_CTX_clear_options. Patch by Earl Chew.
  Note that the use of older OpenSSL versions with fetchmail is unsupported and
  *not* recommended.
# BUG FIXES
* Fix combination of --plugin and -f -. Patch by Alexander Zangerl,
  to fix Debian Bug#671294.
* Clean up logfile vs. syslog handling, and in case logfile overrides
  syslog, send a message to the latter stating where logging goes.
# CHANGES
* The build process can now be made a bit more silent and concise through
  ./configure --enable-silent-rules, or by adding "V=0" to the make command.
# WORKAROUNDS
* Make Maillennium POP3 workarounds less specific, to encompass
  Maillennium POP3/UNIBOX (Maillennium V05.00c++). Reported by Eddie
  via fetchmail-users mailing list, 2012-10-13.

  # SECURITY FIXES
    * CVE-2012-3482 (bnc#775988)
    * CVE-2011-3389
  # BUG FIX
    * The Server certificate: message in verbose mode now appears on stdout like the
      remainder of the output. Reported by Henry Jensen, to fix Debian Bug #639807.
    * The GSSAPI-related autoconf code now matches gssapi.c better, and uses
      a different check to look for GSS_C_NT_HOSTBASED_SERVICE.
      This fixes the GSSAPI-enabled build on NetBSD 6 Beta.
  # CHANGES
    * The security and errata notices fetchmail-{EN,SA}-20??-??.txt are now
      under the more relaxed CC BY-ND 3.0 license (the noncommercial clause
      was dropped). The Creative Commons address was updated.
    * The Python-related Makefile.am parts were simplified to avoid an automake
      1.11.X bug around noinst_PYTHON, Automake Bug #10995.
    * Configuring fetchmail without SSL now triggers a configure warning,
      and asks the user to consider running configure --with-ssl.
  # WORKAROUNDS
    * Some servers, notably Zimbra, return A1234 987 FETCH () in response to
      a header request, in the face of message corruption.  fetchmail now treats
      these as temporary errors. Report and Patch by Mikulas Patocka, Red Hat.
    * Some servers, notably Microsoft Exchange, return "A0009 OK FETCH completed."
      without any header in response to a header request for meeting reminder
      messages (with a "meeting.ics" attachment). fetchmail now treats these as
      transient errors.  Report by John Connett, Patch by Sunil Shetye.

 - critical bug fix
  - The IMAP client no longer inserts NUL bytes into the last line
    of a message when it is not closed with a LF or CRLF sequence.
    Reported by Antoine Levitt.  As a side effect of the fix, and
    in order to avoid a full rewrite, fetchmail will now
    CRLF-terminate the last line fetched through IMAP, even if it
    is originally not terminated by LF or CRLF. This bears no
    relevance if your messages end up in mbox, but adds line
    termination for storages (like Maildir) that do not require
    that the last line be LF- or CRLF-terminated.

 # SECURITY BUG FIXES
  - CVE-2011-1947 (bnc#697368): STARTTLS: Fetchmail runs the IMAP
    STARTTLS or POP3 STLS negotiation with the set timeout (default
    five minutes) now. This was reported missing, with observed
    fetchmail freezes beyond a week, by Thomas Jarosch.
    See fetchmail-SA-2011-01.txt for further details.
 # BUG FIXES
  - IMAP: Do not search for UNSEEN messages in ranges. Usually,
    there are very few new messages and most of the range searches
    result in nothing. Instead, split the long response to make the
    IMAP driver think that there are multiple lines of response.
  - Do not print "skipping message" for old messages even in
    verbose mode. If there are too many old messages, the logs just
    get filled without any real activity.
  - Build: fetchmail now always uses its own MD5 implementation
    rather than trying to find a system library with matched
    header. The library and header variants found on systems are
    too diverse, and the code size saving is not worth any more
    wasted user or programmer time.
 # CHANGES
  - Call strlen() only once when removing CRLF from a line.
  - fetchmail sets Internet domain sockets to "keepalive" mode now.
    Note that there is no portable way to configure actual timeouts
    for this mode, and some systems only support a system-wide
    timeout setting. fetchmail does not attempt to tune the time
    spans of keepalive mode.
- remove build-time dependency on ed

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec 13 11:25:12 UTC 2010 - puzel@novell.com

- update to fetchmail-6.3.19
 - bugfix release
  * When specifying multiple local multidrop lists, do not lose
    wildcard flag.  (Affects "user foo is bar baz * is joe here")
  * In multidrop configurations, an asterisk can now appear
    anywhere in the list of local users, not just at the end.
  * In multidrop mode, header parsing is now more verbose in -vv
    mode, so that it becomes possible to see which header is used.
  * Make --antispam work from command line (these used to work in
    rcfiles).
  * Smoke test XHTML 1.1 validation, and if it fails, skip
    validating HTML documents.  Skip validating
    Mailbox-Names-UTF7.html. Several systems have broken XHTML 1.1
    DTD installations that jeopardize the build.
  * Send a NOOP only after a failed STARTTLS in IMAP.
  * GSSAPI verbose/debug syslog to INFO severity.  Do STARTTLS/STLS
    negotiation in IMAP/POP3 if it is mandatory even if the server
    capabilities do not show support for upgradation to TLS.  To
    use this, configure --sslproto tls1.
  * IMAP: Understand empty strings as FETCH response, seen on
    Yahoo.  Note that fetchmail continues to expect literals as
    FETCH response for now.

- update to fetchmail-6.3.18 
 # SECURITY IMPROVEMENTS TO DEFANG X.509 CERTIFICATE ABUSE
  * Fetchmail now only accepts wildcard certificate common names
    and subject alternative names if they start with "*.". Previous
    versions would accept wildcards even if no period followed
    immediately.
  * Fetchmail now disallows wildcards in certificates to match
    domain literals (such as 10.9.8.7), or wildcards in domain
    literals ("*.168.23.23").  The test is overly picky and
    triggers if the pattern (after skipping the initial wildcard
    "*") or domain consists solely of digits and dots, and thus
    matches more than needed.
  * Fetchmail now disallows wildcarding top-level domains.
 # CRITICAL BUG FIXES AND REGRESSION FIXES
  * Fetchmail 6.3.15, 6.3.16, and 6.3.17 would pick up libmd5 to
    obtain MD5* functions, as an effect of an undocumented Solaris
    MD5 fix.  This caused all MD5-related functions to malfunction
    if, for instance, libmd5.so was installed on other operating
    systems as part of libwww on machines where long isn't
    32-bits, i. e.  usually on 64-bit computers.
  * Fetchmail 6.3.17 warned about insecure SSL/TLS connections
    even if a matching --sslfingerprint was specified. This is an
    omission from an SSL usability change made in 6.3.17.
  * Fetchmail will now apply timeouts to the authentication stage.
    This stage encompasses STARTTLS/STLS negotiation in IMAP/POP3.
    Reported missing by Thomas Jarosch.
  * Fetchmail now cancels GSSAPI authentication properly when
    encountering GSS errors, such as no or unsuitable credentials.
    It now sends an asterisk on a line by its own, as required in
    SASL.  This fixes protocol synchronization issues that cause
    Authentication failures, often observed with kerberized MS
    Exchange servers.
  * Other fixes.

- update to fetchmail-6.3.17
 # SECURITY FIX
  * CVE-2010-1167: Fetchmail before release 6.3.17 did not properly
    sanitize external input (mail headers and UID). 
 # FEATURES
  * Fetchmail now supports a --sslcertfile <file> option to
    specify a "CA bundle" file (a file that contains trusted CA
    certificates).
  * Fetchmail now supports a
    FETCHMAIL_INCLUDE_DEFAULT_X509_CA_CERTS environment variable
    to force loading the default SSL CA certificate locations even
    if --sslcertfile or --sslcertpath is used.  If neither option
    is in effect, fetchmail loads the default locations.
 # REGRESSION FIX
  * Fix string handling in rcfile scanner, which caused fetchmail
    to misparse a run control file in certain circumstances.
 # BUG FIXES
  * Plug memory leak when using a "defaults" entry in the run
    control file.
  * Do not print SSL certificate mismatches unless verbose or
    --sslcertck is enabled.
  * Do not lose "set invisible" in fetchmailconf. (Michael Barnack)

  * Do not close stdout when using mda and "bsmtp -" at the same time.
  * Log operating system errors when BSMTP writes fail.

- update to fetchmail-6.3.14 
 # SECURITY FIXES
  * SSL/TLS certificate information is now also reported properly
    on computers that consider the "char" type signed. Fixes
    malloc() buffer overrun.  Workaround for older versions: do not
    use verbose mode.  
 # BUG FIXES
  * The IMAP client no longer skips messages from several IMAP
     servers including Dovecot if fetchmail's "idle" is in use.
     Causes were that fetchmail (a) ignored some untagged responses
     when it should not (b) relied on EXISTS messages in response to
     EXPUNGE, which aren't mandated by RFC-3501 (the IMAP standard)
     and aren't sent by Dovecot either. Fix by Sunil Shetye (the fix
     also consolidates IMAP response handling, improving overall
     robustness of the IMAP client), bug report and testing by Matt
     Doran, with further hints from Timo Sirainen.
  * The SMTP client now recovers from errors (such as servers
    dropping the connection after errors) when sending an RSET
    command.  Fix by Sunil Shetye. Report by James Moe.
  * The IMAP client now uses "SEARCH UNSEEN" rather than "SEARCH
     UNSEEN NOT DELETED" again on IMAP2, to fix a regression in
     fetchmail 6.2.5 reported by Will Stringer in June 2004. (Sunil
     Shetye)
  * The IMAP client now uses "SEARCH UNSEEN UNDELETED" on IMAP4
    and IMAP4r1 servers (Sunil Shetye).
  * Workaround: The IMAP client now falls back to "FETCH n:m
    FLAGS" if the server does not support "SEARCH". (Sunil Shetye)
  * The IMAP client now requests message numbers in batches of
    1,000 to avoid problems if there are more than 1860 unseen
    messages. (Sunil Shetye) Note that this wasn't security
    relevant because fetchmail would only read up to the maximum
    buffer size and leave the remainder of the string unread, going
    out of synch afterwards.
  * Stricter validation of IMAP responses containing byte or 
    message counts.
- fetchmail 6.3.13 :
 # REGRESSION FIXES
  * The multiline SMTP error fix in release 6.3.12 caused
    fetchmail to lose message codes 400..599 and treat all of these
    as temporary error. This would cause messages to be left on the
    server even if softbounce was turned off.  Reported by Thomas
    Jarosch.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- update to fetchmail-6.3.12
 # REGRESSION FIXES
  * The CVS-2009-2666 fix in fetchmail release 6.3.11 caused a free() of
    unallocated memory on SSL connections, which caused crashes or program aborts
    on some systems (depending on how initialization and free() of unallocated
    memory is handled in compiler and libc).
    Workaround for older versions: run in verbose mode.
    Patch courtesy of Thomas Heinz, fixes Gentoo Bug #280760.
    This regression affected only the 6.3.11 release, but not the patch that was
    part of the security announcement fetchmail-SA-2009-01.
 # BUG FIXES
  * Fix error reporting for GSSAPI on Heimdal (h5l) Kerberos.
  * Look for MD5_Init in libcrypto rather than libssl, fixes Gentoo Kerberos
    builds; fixes upstream parts of Gentoo Bugs #231400 and #185652, and fixes
    BerliOS Bug #16134.
  * Report multiline SMTP errors properly, reported by Earl Chew; fixes Debian Bug
    #569899, reported by Akihiro Terasaki.
    Note: This fix introduced a regression, fixed in 6.3.13.
  * Replace control characters in SMTP replies by '?'.
  * Fetchmailconf: Fix descriptions for smtpaddress and smtpname options;
    smtpaddress is for RCPT TO, not MAIL FROM. Found by Gerard Seibert.

  # SECURITY BUGFIXES
  * CVE-2009-2666: SSL NUL prefix impersonation attack through NULs in a
    part of a X.509 certificate's CommonName and subjectAltName fields. These
    fields use opaque strings with a separate length field, so that the NUL
    character isn't a special character inside the certificate. Fetchmail, being
    written in the C language, used to treat these strings as C strings
    nonetheless, so that the domain comparison would end at the first embedded NUL
    character, rather than at the real end of the string.
      Fetchmail will now abort certificate verification as failed if NULs are
    encountered inside either of these fields regardless of their position, and
    drop the connection even if --sslcertck is not used, because NUL is not a
    valid character in legitimate DNS names.
    See fetchmail-SA-2009-01.txt for details, including a minimal patch.
  
  # BUGFIXES
  * Remove the spurious message "message delimiter found while scanning headers".
    RFC-5322 syntax states that the delimiter is part of the body, and the body is
    optional.
  * Convert all non-printable characters in certificate Subject/Issuer
    Common Name or Subject Alternative Name fields to ANSI-C hex escapes (\xnn,

 # INCOMPATIBLE BUGFIXES AND CHANGES:
  * Fetchmail no longer drops permanently undelivered messages by default, to
    match historic documentation.  It does this by adding a new "softbounce"
    option, see below.
  * There is a new "softbounce" global option that prevents the deletion of
    messages that have not been forwarded. It defaults to "true" for fetchmail
    6.3.X in order to match historic documentation. This may change its default
    in the next major release.
  * For other changes, please see the package changelog
