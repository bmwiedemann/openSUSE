  <title>Full-Featured POP and IMAP Mail Retrieval Daemon</title>
  <description>Fetchmail is a robust and well-documented remote mail retrieval and
forwarding utility intended to be used over on-demand TCP/IP links
(such as SLIP or PPP connections).

Fetchmail retrieves mail from remote mail servers and forwards it to
your local machine's delivery system, so it can be read by normal mail
user agents, such as mutt, elm, pine, (x)emacs/gnus, or mailx.

fetchmailconf, an interactive GUI configurator suitable for end-users,
is included in the fetchmailconf package.</description>
