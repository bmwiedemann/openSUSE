  <title>File System to Navigate, Extract, Create and Modify ZIP Archives</title>
  <description>With fuse-zip you really can work with ZIP archives as real directories. Unlike
KIO or Gnome VFS, it can be used in any application without modifications.
Unlike other FUSE filesystems, only fuse-zip provides write support to ZIP
archives. Also, fuse-zip is faster that all known implementations on large
archives with many files.
