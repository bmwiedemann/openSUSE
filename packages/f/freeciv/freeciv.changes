-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb 18 12:49:11 UTC 2013 - andreas.stieger@gmx.de

- update to 2.3.4
  * When a unit was automatically moved to a transporter to save it 
    from drowning or running out of fuel, the transporter could
    continue to appear empty
  * Bug fixes in unit conversion and upgrade:
    + Prevent cases where units could be converted or upgraded to a 
      type only capable of carrying different cargo to the current
      cargo
    + Prevent conversion of a unit to a type that could not exist 
      on the current tile
  * Units of types the owner cannot build are no longer prevented 
    from upgrade
  * quell spurious "No diplomat action possible" message when an 
    ordinary attempt to move a diplomatic unit failed
  * Following on from a fix in 2.3.3, when a border source such as 
    a fortress is occupied by a unit of a nation other than the 
    owner when a ceasefire runs out, ownership now transfers to 
    that of the occupying unit.
  * When acquiring a technology such as Philosophy which gives 
    further techs by an unusual route (such as through a hut), all 
    progress toward the current research target was lost. Now it is 
    preserved (although 'freecost' is applied)
  * when a city is traded and hence units change ownership, it wasn't 
    checked whether those units provided diplomatic contact to a new 
    nation
  * assertion failure during map generation when no unit in the ruleset 
    satisfied the first role in 'startunits'
  * the tech upkeep with tech_cost_style 2 or 4 was much lower than 
    intended; it only took into account a single tech rather than all 
    preceding techs. As a result, tech upkeep in such rulesets will 
    greatly increase
    + The currently downloadable 'civ2-3' modpack (2.3-2c) thus has 
     tech upkeep disabled. You may want to update your copy. 
  * An unknown effect requirement type in a ruleset now causes a loading
    error rather than being silently interpreted as "None"
  * When a new nation is created in the editor, city style and leader
    sex are now set appropriately (previously they were always European
    and male)
  * A hardcoded year of -4000 is no longer sent to the metaserver in 
    pregame, as it is ruleset-dependent. 
  * The client could crash when your name was mentioned in chat but you 
    had set the 'highlight your player/user name' setting to no color. 
    This could also prevent any connection to a server with the event
    cache enabled if your player name had been mentioned in the past. 
  * Fix possible instability when loading some tilesets.
  * Fix some incorrect inferences about the ability of transported units 
    or units in cities to defend; these are most likely to affect unusual 
    rulesets (e.g., those with ocean cities).
  * The Spanish, Polish, and French translations are once more complete.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Aug 21 19:51:48 UTC 2011 - andreas.stieger@gmx.de

- update to upstream 2.3.0

   A new program has been added to the Freeciv suite: 'freeciv-modpack'. This makes it easier to download and install add-ons ('modpacks': rulesets, tilesets, etc) to the right
   place; you can enter a URL, choose an add-on from the list, and the tool will install it to the correct place for this version of Freeciv to use it. Modpack authors should
   see this page for details of how to publish modpacks for installation by this program.

   As is usual for major releases, 2.3 clients cannot interoperate with pre-2.3 servers, and vice versa. Pre-2.3 savegames can however be loaded into 2.3, and in most cases, the
   supplied rulesets have not changed so much as to make it difficult to complete a game started with 2.2.x's rules.

   For a more detailed list of changes see http://freeciv.wikia.com/wiki/NEWS-2.3.0

- re-base freeciv-no-nb.diff -> freeciv-languages-2.3.0.diff

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul 29 12:11:21 UTC 2011 - andreas.stieger@gmx.de

- update to upstream 2.2.7

  changes since 2.2.6

     * Fixed a regression since 2.2.5: in the Gtk client, the Governments submenu of the Civilization menu frequently gained spurious extra menu items, making it
       difficult/impossible to change to a new government type when it became available. GNA#18323
     * Minor corrections to the Polish translation.

  changes in 2.2.6 since 2.2.5 

    Server / General

     * Fix server crash when an AI-controlled missile failed to eliminate its target. GNA#16451
     * Bug fix: the server could crash with rulesets where gold_upkeep_style=2 due to ending up with a negative gold balance. Previously, if there was not enough gold, at most
       one unit and one building would be sold per turn. Now, as many units/buildings are sold alternately as necessary to restore a positive balance. (This doesn't affect the
       supplied rulesets.) GNA#18221
     * Bug fix: pillaging a road (or removing it in the editor) under a road-native unit could cause a server crash. (This doesn't affect the supplied rulesets.) GNA#16281
     * Bug fix: clients were not always updated when a city was lost (for instance, due to civil war); the loser's client could still show units in the city as owned by that
       player. GNA#18194
     * Bug fix: it was impossible for existing users to log in to servers with authentication enabled running on big-endian machines (such as sparc64). GNA#18170
     * Apply latest lua-5.1.4 patch (9).
     * Various internal changes which should only affect developers. GNA#17812 GNAPATCH#2630

    Clients

     * Bug fix: the client could potentially behave as though it had made a successful connection to a server when in fact the connection had failed. GNA#18211
     * (Gtk) Bug fix: cancelling the "build city" name dialog by pressing Escape could make it impossible to issue the build order again for some units. GNA#18163
     * (Gtk) Bug fix: reinstate the Shift+Ctrl+R shortcut to start a revolution. GNA#18296
     * (Gtk) Possible performance improvement in minimap scrolling. GNA#17878

    Tilesets / Art

     * Allow more match_with entries in tilesets. This should allow the third-party Freeland tileset to work without a patch. GNA#17095
     * Fix a number of minor glitches in the Amplio tileset. GNAPATCH#2732

    Gameplay / Rules

      Supplied rulesetsEdit Supplied rulesets sectionEdit

     * Rearrange implementation of the Hanging Gardens wonder so that it is not mentioned twice in the city dialog happiness popup. GNA#16471

    Help / Documentation

     * Remove spurious incorrect text about government effects on the chance of migration from help on governments. GNA#17919
     * Invisible changes to assist with translation. GNA#18031

    Translations

     * Minor corrections to French, Polish, and Japanese translations.

    Build/portability

     * Suppress some build-time warnings from GCC 4.6. GNA#18217
     * Use Lua path set by configure script, to assist packagers. GNA#18263
