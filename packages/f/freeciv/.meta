  <title>Free Civilization Clone</title>
  <description>A clone of the well known game Civilization by Microprose.

Every player is the leader of an imaginary nation. The aim of the game
can be to create a prospering civilization with commerce and knowledge
exchange or (more often) the extinction of all other civilizations.

To start a new game, first start the server 'civserver,' then start the
client 'civclient'. Have fun!
