  <title>FireWire 1394 support for audio devices, svn snapshot</title>
  <description>FFADO aims to provide a generic, open-source solution
to support FireWire(IEEE1394, iLink) based (semi-)
professional audio interfaces.
It's the successor of the FreeBoB project. FFADO is a
volunteer-based community effort, trying to provide Linux
with at least the same level of functionality that is
present on the other operating systems.
The range of FireWire Audio Devices that we would like
to support is broad: from pure audio interfaces over
mixed audio-control devices to DSP algorithm devices.
