%description
fstrm is a C implementation of Frame Streams that includes a lockless
circular queue implementation and exposes library interfaces for
setting up a dedicated Frame Streams I/O thread and asynchronously
submitting data frames for transport from worker threads.

Frame Streams is a protocol that allows for the transport of
arbitrarily encoded data payload sequences with just 4 bytes per data
frame. Frame Streams does not specify an encoding format for frames
and can be used with data serialization formats that produces byte
sequences, such as Protocol Buffers, XML, JSON, MessagePack, YAML,
etc. Frame Streams can be used both as a streaming transport over a
reliable byte stream socket (TCP, AF_UNIX, TLS, etc.) for data in
motion, as well as a file format for data at rest. A "Content Type"
header identifies the type of payload being carried over an
individual Frame Stream and allows cooperating programs to determine
how to interpret a given sequence of data payloads.
