- Update to 0.6.0 
  It adds a new feature for fstrm_capture. It can perform output
  file rotation when a SIGUSR1 signal is received by fstrm_capture.
  (See the --gmtime or --localtime options.) This allows
  fstrm_capture's output file to be rotated by logrotate or a
  similar external utility. (Output rotation is suppressed if
  fstrm_capture is writing to stdout.)
- Changes from 0.5.0
  - Change license to modern MIT license for compatibility with
    GPLv2 software. Contact software@farsightsecurity.com for
    alternate licensing.
  - src/fstrm_replay.c: For OpenBSD and Posix portability include
    netinet/in.h and sys/socket.h to get struct sockaddr_in and the
    AF_* defines respectively.
  - Fix various compiler warnings.
- Changes from 0.4.0
  The C implementation of the Frame Streams data transport
  protocol, fstrm version 0.4.0, was released. It adds TCP support,
  a new tool, new documentation, and several improvements.
  - Added manual pages for fstrm_capture and fstrm_dump.
  - Added new tool, fstrm_replay, for replaying saved Frame Streams
    data to a socket connection.
  - Adds TCP support. Add tcp_writer to the core library which
    implements a bi-directional Frame Streams writer as a TCP
    socket client. Introduces new developer API:
    fstrm_tcp_writer_init, fstrm_tcp_writer_options_init,
    fstrm_tcp_writer_options_destroy,
    fstrm_tcp_writer_options_set_socket_address, and
    fstrm_tcp_writer_options_set_socket_port.
  - fstrm_capture: new options for reading from TCP socket.
  - fstrm_capture: add "-c" / "--connections" option to limit the
    number of concurrent connections it will accept.
  - fstrm_capture: add "-b / --buffer-size" option to set the read
    buffer size (effectively the maximum frame size) to a value
    other than the default 256 KiB.
  - fstrm_capture: skip oversize messages to fix stalled
    connections caused by messages larger than the read highwater
    mark of the input buffer. Discarded messages are logged for the
    purposes of tuning the input buffer size.
  - fstrm_capture: complete sending of FINISH frame before closing
    connection.
  - Various test additions and improvements.
