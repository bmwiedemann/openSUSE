    the clusters.

Tue Jul  8 14:04:19 UTC 2014 - zawertun@gmail.com

- Update to version 1.1.0:
  + Relicensed the project from GPLv3+ to GPLv2+.
  + OpenBSD support [Helg Bredow].
  + Improved I/O errors handling.
  + Implemented fsync() and fsyncdir().
  + Fixed crash on Mac OS X 10.5 caused by non-standard use of
    realpath(). Also fixed TrueCrypt disks unmounting.
  + Avoid extra erase on writes to the end of a file. This should
    improve linear write speed.
  + Allow arbitrary changing of lower 9 bits of mode. Allow
    owner/group changing to the same owner/group. This fixes rsync.
  + Fixed buffers overflows when handling lengthy file names.
  + Fixed "real size does not equal to size" error on volumes with
    pagefile.sys.
  + Fixed negative IUsed in "df -i" output.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun May 12 12:26:42 UTC 2013 - subchaser1@gmail.com

  openSUSE 12.3

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 26 06:18:14 UTC 2013 - zawertun@gmail.com

    itself.
  + Fixed "Operation not permitted" error on reading an empty file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan 22 17:53:58 UTC 2013 - zawertun@gmail.com

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan 22 07:03:45 UTC 2013 - zawertun@gmail.com

- Added link from man page mount.exfat-fuse.8 to mount.exfat.8

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 21 14:00:32 UTC 2013 - zawertun@gmail.com

- Update to version 1.0.0:
  + Fixed crash when renaming a file within a single directory and
    a new name differs only in case.
  + Fixed clusters allocation: a cluster beyond valid clusters
    range
    could be allocated.
  + Fixed crash when a volume is unmounted while some files are
    open.
  + SConscript now respects AR and RANLIB environment variables.
  + Improved error handling.
  + Enabled big_writes. This improves write speed (larger block
    size means less switches between kernel- and user-space).
  + Do BLKROGET ioctl to make sure the device is not read-only:
    after "blockdev --setro" kernel still allows to open the device
    in read-write mode but fails writes.

  + Fixed "missing EOD entry" error (could happen while reading
    directory that consists of several clusters).
  + Fixed interpretation of minutes field in files timestamps
    (minutes could be displayed incorrectly).
  + Fixed mtime seconds field initialization for newly created file
    (mtime could be 1 sec less than creation time).
  + SConscript now respects CC, CCFLAGS and LDFLAGS environment
    variables.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan 17 15:12:57 MSK 2012 - zawertun@gmail.com

- Update to version 0.9.6:
  + Fixed write performance regression introduced in 0.9.4.
  + Mount in read-only mode if the device is write-protected.
  + Set ctime to mtime to ensure we don't break programs that rely on ctime
    (e.g. rsync considered that all files are outdated) [Eldad Zack].
  + Indicate that FS in not clean when it was not cleanly unmounted.
  + Utilities are now compatible with GNU/Hurd.
  + Fixed several memory leaks that could occur on error handling paths.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun  6 17:25:55 UTC 2011 - zawertun@gmail.com

- Update to version 0.9.5:

  + Utilities are not linked with libfuse anymore.
  + Ensure that the path being opened is either a device or a regular file.
