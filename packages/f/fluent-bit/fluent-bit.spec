Fluent Bit is a fast Log Processor and Forwarder. Its part of the Fluentd Ecosystem and a CNCF sub-project.
Fluent Bit allows to collect log events or metrics from different sources, process them and deliver them to different backends such as Fluentd, Elasticsearch, NATS, InfluxDB or any custom HTTP end-point within others.
In addition, Fluent Bit comes with full Stream Processing capabilities: data manipulation and analytics using SQL queries.
