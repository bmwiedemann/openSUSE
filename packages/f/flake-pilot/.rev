    <comment>flake-pilot - Semi Transparent Container/VM instances

I'd like to add this little rust based utility to the SUSE
distribution as an addition to the container and VM stack. For
more details and a quick start please take a look into the
documentation at:

    <comment>- Bump version: 3.0.9 â†’ 3.0.10

- Clippy fixes

- sudo is required

- Fix error handling
  Make sure the real command that is called through sudo is
  displayed. Also fix that the runas information is really used

- Exit on remove if there is an error
  The remove sequence when used with --container or --vm deregisters
  all apps associated with the container or VM first. If there is
  an error on this deregistration, exit early and do not try to
  delete the container/vm

- Update URL in spec file
