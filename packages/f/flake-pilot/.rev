    <comment>flake-pilot - Semi Transparent Container/VM instances

I'd like to add this little rust based utility to the SUSE
distribution as an addition to the container and VM stack. For
more details and a quick start please take a look into the
documentation at:

    <comment>- Bump version: 3.0.9 → 3.0.10

- Clippy fixes

- sudo is required

- Fix error handling
  Make sure the real command that is called through sudo is
  displayed. Also fix that the runas information is really used

- Exit on remove if there is an error
  The remove sequence when used with --container or --vm deregisters
  all apps associated with the container or VM first. If there is
  an error on this deregistration, exit early and do not try to
  delete the container/vm

- Update URL in spec file

    <comment>- Turn terminal flag setup into function

- Bump version: 3.0.11 → 3.0.12

- Fix race condition on connection check

- set PS1 prompt via sci env

- Add terminal settings for pty stdout in sci
  disable ECHO

- Fix invalid early exit condition

- Bump version: 3.0.10 → 3.0.11

- Fix build for Leap
  Issues on the gcc side for static targets, disable
  sci static build for older targets, e.g Leap

- Prevent use of socat in firecracker-pilot
  Do not shell out socat and use proper UnixListener/UnixStream
  to do this job. This version of the commit works but I stumbled
  across a few issues:
  1. Permission denied when the UnixListener runs as user and the
  firecracker process was called as root (run_as: root in the flake).
  The former implementation ran socat via sudo in the same way as
  the firecracker process. Thus if you register the flake to
  run as root it can now also only be called as root, which is
  acceptable.
  2. The behavior in interactive sessions differs compared to socat.</comment>

- Rebuild with rustls fix
  The crate index was updated and the vendor source seems to have
  fixed the rustls security issue. This fixes bsc#1223217</comment>
