  <title>FreeWnn Japanese Input System--Server Only</title>
  <description>FreeWnn is a Kana-Kanji translation system, originally developed by a
joint project made up of Kyoto University, OMRON Corporation [formerly
known as Tateishi Electronics Co.], and ASTEC Inc. Further development
and maintenance is now done by the &quot;FreeWnn Project&quot;
(http://www.freewnn.org).

The name &quot;Wnn&quot;, is an acronym for the Japanese sentence &quot;Watashino
Namaeha Nakanodesu&quot; (literally, it means &quot;my name is Nakano.&quot;), and is
derived from a goal of the project: to develop a system powerful enough
to translate a whole sentence like that at once.  The source code has
been written in C and is freely distributed. Consequently, Wnn spread
widely among workstation platforms, and became a de facto standard as a
Kana-Kanji translation system for UNIX operating systems.

Wnn works in a client/server manner. The server portion of Wnn, or
jserver, is used as a Kana-Kanji translation engine for clients like
&quot;xwnmo&quot; and &quot;kinput2&quot; (input systems for the X Window System) or for
clients like &quot;Egg&quot;, which are part of Mule (MUlti-Lingual Emacs) and
XEmacs.

This package contains only the Japanese server.</description>
