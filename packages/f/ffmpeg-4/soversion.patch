: """Unfortunately, this version is binary incompatible to 4.2.3 in some
aspects. [...]"""

Further discussion on the mailing list explored this topic, and
revealed that ELF symbol versioning is lacklusterly implemented in
ffmpeg, which can cause inadvertent mixing of library versions on
openSUSE, and precompiled Linux distributions in general. It is
unclear when upstream will have implemented a solution. Until then,
we will need to tighten the requirements between packages, to which
end we stretch the SOVERSION to include MINOR.
