: """Unfortunately, this version is binary incompatible to 4.2.3 in some
aspects. [...]"""

Further discussion on the mailing list explored this topic, and
revealed that ELF symbol versioning is lacklusterly implemented in
ffmpeg, which can cause inadvertent mixing of library versions on
openSUSE, and precompiled Linux distributions in general. It is
unclear when upstream will have implemented a solution. Until then,
we will need to tighten the requirements between packages, to which
end we stretch the SOVERSION to include MINOR.

Programs linking to libavcodec get the right DT_NEEDED field with value
libavcodec.so.58.91, and so they do not request libavcodec.so.58 (which could
potentially lead to libavcodec.so.58.54).
Programs dlopening libavcodec.so.58 will get something random, that's
what dlopening programs have to deal with.
