Sun Nov 29 11:23:09 UTC 2020 - Johannes Weberhofer <jweberhofer@weberhofer.at>

- Update to 0.11.2
  increased stability, filter and action updates
  
- New Features and Enhancements
  * fail2ban-regex:
    - speedup formatted output (bypass unneeded stats creation)
    - extended with prefregex statistic
    - more informative output for `datepattern` (e. g. set from filter) - pattern : description
  * parsing of action in jail-configs considers space between action-names as separator also
  (previously only new-line was allowed), for example `action = a b` would specify 2 actions `a` and `b`
  * new filter and jail for GitLab recognizing failed application logins (gh#fail2ban/fail2ban#2689)
  * new filter and jail for Grafana recognizing failed application logins (gh#fail2ban/fail2ban#2855)
  * new filter and jail for SoftEtherVPN recognizing failed application logins (gh#fail2ban/fail2ban#2723)
  * `filter.d/guacamole.conf` extended with `logging` parameter to follow webapp-logging if it's configured 
    (gh#fail2ban/fail2ban#2631)
  * `filter.d/bitwarden.conf` enhanced to support syslog (gh#fail2ban/fail2ban#2778)
  * introduced new prefix `{UNB}` for `datepattern` to disable word boundaries in regex;
  * datetemplate: improved anchor detection for capturing groups `(^...)`;
  * datepattern: improved handling with wrong recognized timestamps (timezones, no datepattern, etc)
  as well as some warnings signaling user about invalid pattern or zone (gh#fail2ban/fail2ban#2814):
    - filter gets mode in-operation, which gets activated if filter starts processing of new messages;
      in this mode a timestamp read from log-line that appeared recently (not an old line), deviating too much
      from now (up too 24h), will be considered as now (assuming a timezone issue), so could avoid unexpected 
      bypass of failure (previously exceeding `findtime`);
    - better interaction with non-matching optional datepattern or invalid timestamps;
    - implements special datepattern `{NONE}` - allow to find failures totally without date-time in log messages,
    whereas filter will use now as timestamp (gh#fail2ban/fail2ban#2802)
  * performance optimization of `datepattern` (better search algorithm in datedetector, especially for single template);
  * fail2ban-client: extended to unban IP range(s) by subnet (CIDR/mask) or hostname (DNS), gh#fail2ban/fail2ban#2791;
  * extended capturing of alternate tags in filter, allowing combine of multiple groups to single tuple token with new tag
    prefix `<F-TUPLE_`, that would combine value of `<F-V>` with all value of `<F-TUPLE_V?_n?>` tags (gh#fail2ban/fail2ban#2755)

- Fixes
  * [stability] prevent race condition - no ban if filter (backend) is continuously busy if
    too many messages will be found in log, e. g. initial scan of large log-file or journal (gh#fail2ban/fail2ban#2660)
  * pyinotify-backend sporadically avoided initial scanning of log-file by start
  * python 3.9 compatibility (and Travis CI support)
  * restoring a large number (500+ depending on files ulimit) of current bans when using PyPy fixed
  * manual ban is written to database, so can be restored by restart (gh#fail2ban/fail2ban#2647)
  * `jail.conf`: don't specify `action` directly in jails (use `action_` or `banaction` instead)
  * no mails-action added per default anymore (e. g. to allow that `action = %(action_mw)s` should be specified
    per jail or in default section in jail.local), closes gh#fail2ban/fail2ban#2357
  * ensure we've unique action name per jail (also if parameter `actname` is not set but name deviates from standard name, gh#fail2ban/fail2ban#2686)
  * don't use `%(banaction)s` interpolation because it can be complex value (containing `[...]` and/or quotes), 
    so would bother the action interpolation
  * fixed type conversion in config readers (take place after all interpolations get ready), that allows to 
    specify typed parameters variable (as substitutions) as well as to supply it in other sections or as init parameters.
  * `action.d/*-ipset*.conf`: several ipset actions fixed (no timeout per default anymore), so no discrepancy
    between ipset and fail2ban (removal from ipset will be managed by fail2ban only, gh#fail2ban/fail2ban#2703)
  * `action.d/cloudflare.conf`: fixed `actionunban` (considering new-line chars and optionally real json-parsing
   with `jq`, gh#fail2ban/fail2ban#2140, gh#fail2ban/fail2ban#2656)
  * `action.d/nftables.conf` (type=multiport only): fixed port range selector, replacing `:` with `-` (gh#fail2ban/fail2ban#2763)
  * `action.d/firewallcmd-*.conf` (multiport only): fixed port range selector, replacing `:` with `-` (gh#fail2ban/fail2ban#2821)
  * `action.d/bsd-ipfw.conf`: fixed selection of rule-no by large list or initial `lowest_rule_num` (gh#fail2ban/fail2ban#2836)
  * `filter.d/common.conf`: avoid substitute of default values in related `lt_*` section, `__prefix_line`
    should be interpolated in definition section (inside the filter-config, gh#fail2ban/fail2ban#2650)
  * `filter.d/dovecot.conf`: 
    - add managesieve and submission support (gh#fail2ban/fail2ban#2795);
    - accept messages with more verbose logging (gh#fail2ban/fail2ban#2573);
  * `filter.d/courier-smtp.conf`: prefregex extended to consider port in log-message (gh#fail2ban/fail2ban#2697)
  * `filter.d/traefik-auth.conf`: filter extended with parameter mode (`normal`, `ddos`, `aggressive`) to handle 
    the match of username differently (gh#fail2ban/fail2ban#2693):
    - `normal`: matches 401 with supplied username only
    - `ddos`: matches 401 without supplied username only
    - `aggressive`: matches 401 and any variant (with and without username)
  * `filter.d/sshd.conf`: normalizing of user pattern in all RE's, allowing empty user (gh#fail2ban/fail2ban#2749)
  
- Rebased patches
- Removed upstream patch fail2ban-0.10.4-upstream-pid-file-location.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug 19 09:04:12 UTC 2020 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Use %{_tmpfilesdir} consistently throughout the .spec.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 21 07:49:38 UTC 2020 - Paolo Stivanin <info@paolostivanin.com>

- Update to 0.11.1:
  * Increment ban time (+ observer) functionality introduced.
  * Database functionality extended with bad ips.
  * New tags (usable in actions):
    - `<bancount>` - ban count of this offender if known as bad
      (started by 1 for unknown)
    - `<bantime>` - current ban-time of the ticket
      (prolongation can be retarded up to 10 sec.)
  * Introduced new action command `actionprolong` to prolong ban-time
    (e. g. set new timeout if expected);
  * algorithm of restore current bans after restart changed:
    update the restored ban-time (and therefore 
    end of ban) of the ticket with ban-time of jail (as maximum),
    for all tickets with ban-time greater (or persistent)
  * added new setup-option `--without-tests` to skip building
    and installing of tests files (gh-2287).
  * added new command `fail2ban-client get <JAIL> banip ?sep-char|--with-time?`
    to get the banned ip addresses (gh-1916).
  * purge database will be executed now (within observer).
   restoring currently banned ip after service restart fixed
    (now < timeofban + bantime), ignore old log failures (already banned)
  * upgrade database: update new created table `bips` with entries
    from table `bans` (allows restore current bans after
    upgrade from version <= 0.10)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan  9 14:06:14 UTC 2020 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Switch to use python3 (upstream supported):
  + BuildRequire python3-tools instead of python-devel (for the
    2to3 tool).
  + Drop the python-gamin dependency.
  + Replace all python-FOO deps for their python3-FOO counterpart.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 12 09:10:37 UTC 2019 - Johannes Weberhofer <jweberhofer@weberhofer.at>

- Added fail2ban-0.10.4-env-script-interpreter.patch to define interpretor
- removal of SuSEfirewall2-fail2ban for factory versions since SuSEfirewall2
  will be removed from Factory (see sr#713247):
  * fail2ban-opensuse-service.patch: removed references to SuSEfirewall2 service
  * fail2ban-opensuse-service-sfw.patch: use references to SuSEfirewall2 only for
    older distributions
  * Removed installation recommendation of the fail2ban-SuSEfirewall2
    package for all distributions as it is deprecated.
- fail2ban-0.10.4-upstream-pid-file-location.patch changed fail2ban unit file
  location (boo#1145181, gh#fail2ban/fail2ban#2474)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun 11 12:42:54 UTC 2019 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- BuildRequire pkgconfig(systemd) instead of systemd: allow OBS to

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Feb 16 22:28:49 UTC 2019 - chris@computersalat.de

- ver. 0.10.4 (2018/10/04) - ten-four-on-due-date-ten-four
  * https://github.com/fail2ban/fail2ban/blob/0.10.4/ChangeLog

- Fixes
  * `filter.d/dovecot.conf`: 
    - failregex enhancement to catch sql password mismatch errors (gh-2153);
    - disconnected with "proxy dest auth failed" (gh-2184);
  * `filter.d/freeswitch.conf`:
    - provide compatibility for log-format from gh-2193:
      * extended with new default date-pattern `^(?:%%Y-)?%%m-%%d[ T]%%H:%%M:%%S(?:\.%%f)?` to cover
        `YYYY-mm-dd HH:MM::SS.ms` as well as `mm-dd HH:MM::SS.ms` (so year is optional);
      * more optional arguments in log-line (so accept [WARN] as well as [WARNING] and optional [SOFIA] hereafter);
    - extended with mode parameter, allows to avoid matching of messages like `auth challenge (REGISTER)`
      (see gh-2163) (currently `extra` as default to be backwards-compatible), see comments in filter
      how to set it to mode `normal`.
  * `filter.d/domino-smtp.conf`:
    - recognizes failures logged using another format (something like session-id, IP enclosed in square brackets);
    - failregex extended to catch connections rejected for policy reasons (gh-2228);
  * `action.d/hostsdeny.conf`: fix parameter in config (dynamic parameters stating with '_' are protected 
    and don't allowed in command-actions), see gh-2114;
  * decoding stability fix by wrong encoded characters like utf-8 surrogate pairs, etc (gh-2171):
    - fail2ban running in the preferred encoding now (as default encoding also within python 2.x), mostly
      `UTF-8` in opposite to `ascii` previously, so minimizes influence of implicit conversions errors;
    - actions: avoid possible conversion errors on wrong-chars by replace tags;
    - database: improve adapter/converter handlers working on invalid characters in sense of json and/or sqlite-database;
      additionally both are exception-safe now, so avoid possible locking of database (closes gh-2137);
    - logging in fail2ban is process-wide exception-safe now.
  * repaired start-time of initial seek to time (as well as other log-parsing related data), 
    if parameter `logpath` specified before `findtime`, `backend`, `datepattern`, etc (gh-2173)
  * systemd: fixed type error on option `journalflags`: an integer is required (gh-2125);

- New Features
  * new option `ignorecache` to improve performance of ignore failure check (using caching of `ignoreip`, 
    `ignoreself` and `ignorecommand`), see `man jail.conf` for syntax-example;
  * `ignorecommand` extended to use actions-similar replacement (capable to interpolate 
    all possible tags like `<ip-host>`, `<family>`, `<fid>`, `F-USER` etc.)

- Enhancements
  * `filter.d/dovecot.conf`: extended with tags F-USER (and alternatives) to collect user-logins (gh-2168)
  * since v.0.10.4, fail2ban-client, fail2ban-server and fail2ban-regex will return version without logo info,
    additionally option `-V` can be used to get version in normalized machine-readable short format.

- rebase patches
  * fail2ban-opensuse-locations.patch
  * fail2ban-opensuse-service.patch
- add signature file

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Apr 21 06:02:12 UTC 2018 - jweberhofer@weberhofer.at

- Updated to version 0.10.3.1. Changelog:
  https://github.com/fail2ban/fail2ban/blob/0.10.3.1/ChangeLog

  * fixed JSON serialization for the set-object within dump into database (gh-2103).

- Updated to version 0.10.3. Changelog:
  https://github.com/fail2ban/fail2ban/blob/0.10.3/ChangeLog

- Fixes
  * `filter.d/asterisk.conf`: fixed failregex prefix by log over remote syslog server (gh-2060);
  * `filter.d/exim.conf`: failregex extended - SMTP call dropped: too many syntax or protocol errors (gh-2048);
  * `filter.d/recidive.conf`: fixed if logging into systemd-journal (SYSLOG) with daemon name in prefix, gh-2069;
  * `filter.d/sendmail-auth.conf`, `filter.d/sendmail-reject.conf` :
    - fixed failregex, sendmail uses prefix 'IPv6:' logging of IPv6 addresses (gh-2064);
  * `filter.d/sshd.conf`:
    - failregex got an optional space in order to match new log-format (see gh-2061);
    - fixed ddos-mode regex to match refactored message (some versions can contain port now, see gh-2062);
    - fixed root login refused regex (optional port before preauth, gh-2080);
    - avoid banning of legitimate users when pam_unix used in combination with other password method, so
      bypass pam_unix failures if accepted available for this user gh-2070;
    - amend to gh-1263 with better handling of multiple attempts (failures for different user-names recognized immediatelly);
    - mode `ddos` (and `aggressive`) extended to catch `Connection closed by ... [preauth]`, so in DDOS mode
      it counts failure on closing connection within preauth-stage (gh-2085);
  * `action.d/abuseipdb.conf`: fixed curl cypher errors and comment quote-issue (gh-2044, gh-2101);
  * `action.d/badips.py`: implicit convert IPAddr to str, solves an issue "expected string, IPAddr found" (gh-2059);
  * `action.d/hostsdeny.conf`: fixed IPv6 syntax (enclosed in square brackets, gh-2066);
  * (Free)BSD ipfw actionban fixed to allow same rule added several times (gh-2054);

- New Features
  * several stability and performance optimizations, more effective filter parsing, etc;
  * stable runnable within python versions 3.6 (as well as within 3.7-dev);

- Enhancements
  * `filter.d/apache-auth.conf`: detection of Apache SNI errors resp. misredirect attempts (gh-2017, gh-2097);
  * `filter.d/apache-noscript.conf`: extend failregex to match "Primary script unknown", e. g. from php-fpm (gh-2073);
  * date-detector extended with long epoch (`LEPOCH`) to parse milliseconds/microseconds posix-dates (gh-2029);
  * possibility to specify own regex-pattern to match epoch date-time, e. g. `^\[{EPOCH}\]` or `^\[{LEPOCH}\]` (gh-2038);
    the epoch-pattern similar to `{DATE}` patterns does the capture and cuts out the match of whole pattern from the log-line,
    e. g. date-pattern `^\[{LEPOCH}\]\s+:` will match and cut out `[1516469849551000] :` from begin of the log-line.
  * badips.py now uses https instead of plain http when requesting badips.com (gh-2057);
  * add support for "any" badips.py bancategory, to be able to retrieve IPs from all categories with a desired score (gh-2056);
  * Introduced new parameter `padding` for logging within fail2ban-server (default on, excepting SYSLOG):
    Usage `logtarget = target[padding=on|off]`

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb 20 08:19:07 UTC 2018 - jweberhofer@weberhofer.at

- Updated to version 0.10.2. Changelog:
  https://github.com/fail2ban/fail2ban/blob/0.10.2/ChangeLog

- rebased patch

- Incompatibility list (compared to v.0.9):
  * Filter (or `failregex`) internal capture-groups:
    - If you've your own `failregex` or custom filters using conditional match `(?P=host)`, you should
      rewrite the regex like in example below resp. using `(?:(?P=ip4)|(?P=ip6)` instead of `(?P=host)`
      (or `(?:(?P=ip4)|(?P=ip6)|(?P=dns))` corresponding your `usedns` and `raw` settings).
      Of course you can always define your own capture-group (like below `_cond_ip_`) to do this.
      testln="1500000000 failure from 192.0.2.1: bad host 192.0.2.1"
      fail2ban-regex "$testln" "^\s*failure from (?P<_cond_ip_><HOST>): bad host (?P=_cond_ip_)$"
    - New internal groups (currently reserved for internal usage):
      `ip4`, `ip6`, `dns`, `fid`, `fport`, additionally `user` and another captures in lower case if
      mapping from tag `<F-*>` used in failregex (e. g. `user` by `<F-USER>`).
  * v.0.10 uses more precise date template handling, that can be theoretically incompatible to some
    user configurations resp. `datepattern`.
  * Since v0.10 fail2ban supports the matching of the IPv6 addresses, but not all ban actions are
    IPv6-capable now.

- Incompatibility:
  * The configuration for jails using banaction `pf` can be incompatible after upgrade, because pf-action uses
    anchors now (see `action.d/pf.conf` for more information). If you want use obsolete handling without anchors,
    just rewrite it in the `jail.local` by overwrite of `pfctl` parameter, e. g. like `banaction = pf[pfctl="pfctl"]`. 

- Fixes
  * Fixed logging to systemd-journal: new logtarget value SYSOUT can be used instead of STDOUT, to avoid 
    write of the time-stamp, if logging to systemd-journal from foreground mode (gh-1876)
  * Fixed recognition of the new date-format on mysqld-auth filter (gh-1639)
  * jail.conf: port `imap3` replaced with `imap` everywhere, since imap3 is not a standard port and old rarely 
    (if ever) used and can missing on some systems (e. g. debian stretch), see gh-1942.
  * config/paths-common.conf: added missing initial values (and small normalization in config/paths-*.conf)
    in order to avoid errors while interpolating (e. g. starting with systemd-backend), see gh-1955.
  * `action.d/pf.conf`: 
    - fixed syntax error in achnor definition (documentation, see gh-1919);
    - enclose ports in braces for multiport jails (see gh-1925);
  * `action.d/firewallcmd-ipset.conf`: fixed create of set for ipv6 (missing `family inet6`, gh-1990)
  * `filter.d/sshd.conf`:
    - extended failregex for modes "extra"/"aggressive": now finds all possible (also future)
      forms of "no matching (cipher|mac|MAC|compression method|key exchange method|host key type) found", 
      see "ssherr.c" for all possible SSH_ERR_..._ALG_MATCH errors (gh-1943, gh-1944);
    - fixed failregex in order to avoid banning of legitimate users with multiple public keys (gh-2014, gh-1263);

- New Features
  * datedetector: extended default date-patterns (allows extra space between the date and time stamps);
    introduces 2 new format directives (with corresponding %Ex prefix for more precise parsing):
    - %k - one- or two-digit number giving the hour of the day (0-23) on a 24-hour clock,
      (corresponds %H, but allows space if not zero-padded).
    - %l - one- or two-digit number giving the hour of the day (12-11) on a 12-hour clock,
      (corresponds %I, but allows space if not zero-padded).
  * `filter.d/exim.conf`: added mode `aggressive` to ban flood resp. DDOS-similar failures (gh-1983);

- New Actions:
  * `action.d/nginx-block-map.conf` - in order to ban not IP-related tickets via nginx (session blacklisting in
     nginx-location with map-file);

  - Enhancements
    * jail.conf: extended with new parameter `mode` for the filters supporting it (gh-1988);
    * action.d/pf.conf: extended with bulk-unban, command `actionflush` in order to flush all bans at once.
    * Introduced new parameters for logging within fail2ban-server (gh-1980).
      Usage `logtarget = target[facility=..., datetime=on|off, format="..."]`:
      - `facility` - specify syslog facility (default `daemon`, see https://docs.python.org/2/library/logging.handlers.html#sysloghandler
        for the list of facilities);
      - `datetime` - add date-time to the message (default on, ignored if `format` specified);
      - `format` - specify own format how it will be logged, for example for short-log into STDOUT:
        `fail2ban-server -f --logtarget 'stdout[format="%(relativeCreated)5d | %(message)s"]' start`;
    * Automatically recover or recreate corrupt persistent database (e. g. if failed to open with 
     'database disk image is malformed'). Fail2ban will create a backup, try to repair the database,
      if repair fails - recreate new database (gh-1465, gh-2004).

  * IPv6 support
    - IP addresses are now handled as objects rather than strings capable for 
      handling both address types IPv4 and IPv6
    - iptables related actions have been amended to support IPv6 specific actions
      additionally
    - hostsdeny and route actions have been tested to be aware of v4 and v6 already
    - pf action for *BSD systems has been improved and supports now also v4 and v6
    - name resolution is now working for either address type
    - new conditional section functionality used in config resp. includes:
      - [Init?family=inet4] - IPv4 qualified hosts only
      - [Init?family=inet6] - IPv6 qualified hosts only
  * Reporting via abuseipdb.com
    - Bans can now be reported to abuseipdb
    - Catagories must be set in the config
    - Relevant log lines included in report
  * Several commands extended and new commands introduced

- Lots of fixes and internal improvements

- Incompatibitilities:
  * Filter (or `failregex`) internal capture-groups:
  - If you've your own `failregex` or custom filters using conditional match `(?P=host)`, you should
    rewrite the regex like in example below resp. using `(?:(?P=ip4)|(?P=ip6)` instead of `(?P=host)`
    (or `(?:(?P=ip4)|(?P=ip6)|(?P=dns))` corresponding your `usedns` and `raw` settings).

    Of course you can always your own capture-group (like below `_cond_ip_`) to do this.
    ```
    testln="1500000000 failure from 192.0.2.1: bad host 192.0.2.1"
    fail2ban-regex "$testln" "^\s*failure from (?P<_cond_ip_><HOST>): bad host (?P=_cond_ip_)$"
    ```
  - New internal groups (currently reserved for internal usage):
    `ip4`, `ip6`, `dns`, `fid`, `fport`, additionally `user` and another captures in lower case if
    mapping from tag `<F-*>` used in failregex (e. g. `user` by `<F-USER>`).

  * v.0.10 uses more precise date template handling, that can be theoretically incompatible to some
  user configurations resp. `datepattern`.

  * Since v0.10 fail2ban supports the matching of the IPv6 addresses, but not all ban actions are
  IPv6-capable now.

Thu Jan 26 23:16:49 UTC 2017 - chris@computersalat.de

- Update to 0.9.6 (2016/12/10)

### Fixes
* Misleading add resp. enable of (already available) jail in database, that
  induced a subsequent error: last position of log file will be never retrieved (gh-795)
* Fixed a distribution related bug within testReadStockJailConfForceEnabled
  (e.g. test-cases faults on Fedora, see gh-1353)
* Fixed pythonic filters and test scripts (running via wrong python version,
  uses "fail2ban-python" now);
* Fixed test case "testSetupInstallRoot" for not default python version (also
  using direct call, out of virtualenv);
* Fixed ambiguous wrong recognized date pattern resp. its optional parts (see gh-1512);
* FIPS compliant, use sha1 instead of md5 if it not allowed (see gh-1540)
* Monit config: scripting is not supported in path (gh-1556)
* `filter.d/apache-modsecurity.conf`
    - Fixed for newer version (one space, gh-1626), optimized: non-greedy catch-all
      replaced for safer match, unneeded catch-all anchoring removed, non-capturing
* `filter.d/asterisk.conf`
    - Fixed to match different asterisk log prefix (source file: method:)
* `filter.d/dovecot.conf`
    - Fixed failregex ignores failures through some not relevant info (gh-1623)
* `filter.d/ignorecommands/apache-fakegooglebot`
    - Fixed error within apache-fakegooglebot, that will be called
      with wrong python version (gh-1506)
* `filter.d/assp.conf`
    - Extended failregex and test cases to handle ASSP V1 and V2 (gh-1494)
* `filter.d/postfix-sasl.conf`
    - Allow for having no trailing space after 'failed:' (gh-1497)
* `filter.d/vsftpd.conf`
    - Optional reason part in message after FAIL LOGIN (gh-1543)
* `filter.d/sendmail-reject.conf`
    - removed mandatory double space (if dns-host available, gh-1579)
* filter.d/sshd.conf
    - recognized "Failed publickey for" (gh-1477);
    - optimized failregex to match all of "Failed any-method for ... from <HOST>" (gh-1479)
    - eliminated possible complex injections (on user-name resp. auth-info, see gh-1479)
    - optional port part after host (see gh-1533, gh-1581)

### New Features
* New Actions:
    - `action.d/npf.conf` for NPF, the latest packet filter for NetBSD
* New Filters:
    - `filter.d/mongodb-auth.conf` for MongoDB (document-oriented NoSQL database engine)
      (gh-1586, gh-1606 and gh-1607)

### Enhancements
* DateTemplate regexp extended with the word-end boundary, additionally to
  word-start boundary
* Introduces new command "fail2ban-python", as automatically created symlink to
  python executable, where fail2ban currently installed (resp. its modules are located):
    - allows to use the same version, fail2ban currently running, e.g. in
      external scripts just via replace python with fail2ban-python:
      ```diff
      -#!/usr/bin/env python
      +#!/usr/bin/env fail2ban-python
      ```
    - always the same pickle protocol
    - the same (and also guaranteed available) fail2ban modules
    - simplified stand-alone install, resp. stand-alone installation possibility
      via setup (like gh-1487) is getting closer
* Several test cases rewritten using new methods assertIn, assertNotIn
* New forward compatibility method assertRaisesRegexp (normally python >= 2.7).
  Methods assertIn, assertNotIn, assertRaisesRegexp, assertLogged, assertNotLogged
  are test covered now
* Jail configuration extended with new syntax to pass options to the backend (see gh-1408),
  examples:
    - `backend = systemd[journalpath=/run/log/journal/machine-1]`
    - `backend = systemd[journalfiles="/run/log/journal/machine-1/system.journal, /run/log/journal/machine-1/user.journal"]`
    - `backend = systemd[journalflags=2]`

- rebase fail2ban-opensuse-locations.patch, fail2ban-opensuse-service.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul 25 13:43:18 UTC 2016 - jweberhofer@weberhofer.at

- Update to version 0.9.5

  New Features
    * New Actions: action.d/firewallcmd-rich-rules and 
      action.d/firewallcmd-rich-logging (gh#fail2ban/fail2ban#1367)
    * New filter: slapd - ban hosts, that were failed to connect with invalid
      credentials: error code 49 (gh#fail2ban/fail2ban#1478)

  Enhancements
    * Extreme speedup of all sqlite database operations
        (gh#fail2ban/fail2ban#1436), by using of following sqlite options:
      - (synchronous = OFF) write data through OS without syncing
      - (journal_mode = MEMORY) use memory for the transaction logging
      - (temp_store = MEMORY) temporary tables and indices are kept in memory
    * journald journalmatch for pure-ftpd (gh#fail2ban/fail2ban#1362)
    * Added additional regex filter for dovecot ldap authentication 
      failures (gh#fail2ban/fail2ban#1370)
    * filter.d/exim*conf
      - Added additional regexes (gh#fail2ban/fail2ban#1371)
      - Made port entry optional

  Fixes
  * filter.d/monit.conf
    - Extended failregex with new monit "access denied" version
      (gh#fail2ban/fail2ban#1355)
    - failregex of previous monit version merged as single expression
  * filter.d/postfix.conf, filter.d/postfix-sasl.conf
    - Extended failregex daemon part, matching also postfix/smtps/smtpd now
      (gh#fail2ban/fail2ban#1391)

  * Fixed a grave bug within tags substitutions because of incorrect detection
    of recursion in case of multiple inline substitutions of the same tag
    (affected actions: bsd-ipfw, etc). Now tracks the actual list of the
    already substituted tags (per tag instead of single list)

  * filter.d/common.conf
    - Unexpected extra regex-space in generic __prefix_line
     (gh#fail2ban/fail2ban#1405)
    - All optional spaces normalized in common.conf, test covered now
    - Generic __prefix_line extended with optional brackets for the date ambit
      (gh#fail2ban/fail2ban#1421), added new parameter __date_ambit 

  * gentoo-initd fixed --pidfile bug: --pidfile is option of start-stop-daemon,
    not argument of fail2ban (see gh#fail2ban/fail2ban#1434)

  * filter.d/asterisk.conf
    - Fixed security log support for PJSIP and Asterisk 13+
      (gh#fail2ban/fail2ban#1456)
    - Improved log support for PJSIP and Asterisk 13+ with different callID
      (gh#fail2ban/fail2ban#1458)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar 10 14:09:51 UTC 2016 - jweberhofer@weberhofer.at

- Mark /etc/fail2ban/fail2ban.conf as noreplace.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar 10 10:58:53 UTC 2016 - jweberhofer@weberhofer.at

- Removed patch: fail2ban-exclude-dev-log-tests.patch
- Removed patch: fail2ban-upstream-fix-ExecuteTimeoutWithNastyChildren-test.patch
- rebased other patches
- Defined services which per default uses systemd logger
- Provide /usr/sbin/rcfail2ban also on systemd based distros

- All files in /etc/fail2ban/ except jail.local are now automatically replaced
  upon installation of fail2ban

- The update to this versions allow to close boo#917818, as the logger-backends for
  several services are now centrally set in /etc/fail2ban/paths-opensuse.conf

- Update to version 0.9.4
  New Features:
   * New interpolation feature for definition config readers - `<known/parameter>`
     (means last known init definition of filters or actions with name `parameter`).
     This interpolation makes possible to extend a parameters of stock filter or 
     action directly in jail inside jail.local file, without creating a separately
     filter.d/*.local file.
     As extension to interpolation `%(known/parameter)s`, that does not works for
     filter and action init parameters
   * New actions:
     - nftables-multiport and nftables-allports - filtering using nftables
       framework. Note: it requires a pre-existing chain for the filtering rule.
   * New filters:
     - openhab - domotic software authentication failure with the
       rest api and web interface (gh-1223)
     - nginx-limit-req - ban hosts, that were failed through nginx by limit
       request processing rate (ngx_http_limit_req_module)
     - murmur - ban hosts that repeatedly attempt to connect to
       murmur/mumble-server with an invalid server password or certificate.
     - haproxy-http-auth - filter to match failed HTTP Authentications against a
       HAProxy server
   * New jails:
     - murmur - bans TCP and UDP from the bad host on the default murmur port.
   * sshd filter got new failregex to match "maximum authentication
     attempts exceeded" (introduced in openssh 6.8)
   * Added filter for Mac OS screen sharing (VNC) daemon

  Enhancements:
   * Do not rotate empty log files
   * Added new date pattern with year after day (e.g. Sun Jan 23 2005 21:59:59)
     http://bugs.debian.org/798923
   * Added openSUSE path configuration (Thanks Johannes Weberhofer)
   * Allow to split ignoreip entries by ',' as well as by ' ' (gh-1197)
   * Added a timeout (3 sec) to urlopen within badips.py action
     (Thanks M. Maraun)
   * Added check against atacker's Googlebot PTR fake records
     (Thanks Pablo Rodriguez Fernandez)
   * Enhance filter against atacker's Googlebot PTR fake records
     (gh-1226)
   * Nginx log paths extended (prefixed with "*" wildcard) (gh-1237)
   * Added filter for openhab domotic software authentication failure with the
     rest api and web interface (gh-1223)
   * Add *_backend options for services to allow distros to set the default
     backend per service, set default to systemd for Fedora as appropriate
   * Performance improvements while monitoring large number of files (gh-1265).
     Use associative array (dict) for monitored log files to speed up lookup 
     operations. Thanks @kshetragia
   * Specified that fail2ban is PartOf iptables.service firewalld.service in
     .service file -- would reload fail2ban if those services are restarted
   * Provides new default `fail2ban_version` and interpolation variable
     `fail2ban_agent` in jail.conf
   * Enhance filter 'postfix' to ban incoming SMTP client with no fqdn hostname,
     and to support multiple instances of postfix having varying suffix (gh-1331)
     (Thanks Tom Hendrikx)
   * files/gentoo-initd to use start-stop-daemon to robustify restarting the service

  Fixes:
   * roundcube-auth jail typo for logpath
   * Fix dnsToIp resolver for fqdn with large list of IPs (gh-1164)
   * filter.d/apache-badbots.conf
     - Updated useragent string regex adding escape for `+`
   * filter.d/mysqld-auth.conf
 gg  - Updated "Access denied ..." regex for MySQL 5.6 and later (gh-1211, gh-1332)
   * filter.d/sshd.conf
     - Updated "Auth fail" regex for OpenSSH 5.9 and later
   * Treat failed and killed execution of commands identically (only
     different log messages), which addresses different behavior on different
     exit codes of dash and bash (gh-1155)
   * Fix jail.conf.5 man's section (gh-1226)
   * Fixed default banaction for allports jails like pam-generic, recidive, etc
     with new default variable `banaction_allports` (gh-1216)

     for python version < 3.x (gh-1248)
   * Use postfix_log logpath for postfix-rbl jail
   * filters.d/postfix.conf - add 'Sender address rejected: Domain not found' failregex
   * use `fail2ban_agent` as user-agent in actions badips, blocklist_de, etc (gh-1271)
   * Fix ignoring the sender option by action_mw, action_mwl and action_c_mwl
   * Changed filter.d/asterisk regex for "Call from ..." (few vulnerable now)
   * Removed compression and rotation count from logrotate (inherit them from
     the global logrotate config)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb  4 15:50:38 UTC 2016 - jweberhofer@weberhofer.at

- Require python-systemd for openSUSE 12.3+
- Cleaned up the spec file
- Added /run/fail2ban for openSUSE 13.2+
- Don't fail on test-errors

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 23 10:10:17 UTC 2015 - jweberhofer@weberhofer.at

- Added fail2ban-upstream-fix-ExecuteTimeoutWithNastyChildren-test.patch
  to fix the former failing test and removed
  fail2ban-exclude-ExecuteTimeoutWithNastyChildren-test.patch

- Do not longer create test-package. Developers should not use the packaged
  version of fail2ban.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep  7 09:45:56 UTC 2015 - jweberhofer@weberhofer.at

- patches are no longer included conditionally

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep  7 06:54:33 UTC 2015 - jweberhofer@weberhofer.at

- fail2ban-exclude-ExecuteTimeoutWithNastyChildren-test.patch excludes the
  ExecuteTimeoutWithNastyChildren test, as it doesn't run correctly on
  openSUSE.

- fail2ban-disable-iptables-w-option.patch disables iptables "-w" option for
  older releases. 

- Update to version 0.9.3

- IMPORTANT incompatible changes:
   * filter.d/roundcube-auth.conf
     - Changed logpath to 'errors' log (was 'userlogins')
   * action.d/iptables-common.conf
     - All calls to iptables command now use -w switch introduced in
       iptables 1.4.20 (some distribution could have patched their
       earlier base version as well) to provide this locking mechanism
       useful under heavy load to avoid contesting on iptables calls.
       If you need to disable, define 'action.d/iptables-common.local'
       with empty value for 'lockingopt' in `[Init]` section.
   * mail-whois-lines, sendmail-geoip-lines and sendmail-whois-lines
     actions now include by default only the first 1000 log lines in
     the emails.  Adjust <grepopts> to augment the behavior.

- Fixes:
   * reload in interactive mode appends all the jails twice (gh-825)
   * reload server/jail failed if database used (but was not changed) and
     some jail active (gh-1072)
   * filter.d/dovecot.conf - also match unknown user in passwd-file.
     Thanks Anton Shestakov
   * Fix fail2ban-regex not parsing journalmatch correctly from filter config
   * filter.d/asterisk.conf - fix security log support for Asterisk 12+
   * filter.d/roundcube-auth.conf
     - Updated regex to work with 'errors' log (1.0.5 and 1.1.1)
     - Added regex to work with 'userlogins' log
   * action.d/sendmail*.conf - use LC_ALL (superseeding LC_TIME) to override
     locale on systems with customized LC_ALL
   * performance fix: minimizes connection overhead, close socket only at
     communication end (gh-1099)
   * unbanip always deletes ip from database (independent of bantime, also if
     currently not banned or persistent)
   * guarantee order of dbfile to be before dbpurgeage (gh-1048)
   * always set 'dbfile' before other database options (gh-1050)
   * kill the entire process group of the child process upon timeout (gh-1129).
     Otherwise could lead to resource exhaustion due to hanging whois
     processes.
   * resolve /var/run/fail2ban path in setup.py to help installation
     on platforms with /var/run -> /run symlink (gh-1142)

- New Features:
   * RETURN iptables target is now a variable: <returntype>
   * New type of operation: pass2allow, use fail2ban for "knocking",
     opening a closed port by swapping blocktype and returntype
   * New filters:
     - froxlor-auth - Thanks Joern Muehlencord
     - apache-pass - filter Apache access log for successful authentication
   * New actions:
     - shorewall-ipset-proto6 - using proto feature of the Shorewall. Still requires
	   manual pre-configuration of the shorewall. See the action file for detail.
   * New jails:
     - pass2allow-ftp - allows FTP traffic after successful HTTP authentication

- Enhancements:
   * action.d/cloudflare.conf - improved documentation on how to allow
     multiple CF accounts, and jail.conf got new compound action
     definition action_cf_mwl to submit cloudflare report.
   * Check access to socket for more detailed logging on error (gh-595)
   * fail2ban-testcases man page
   * filter.d/apache-badbots.conf, filter.d/nginx-botsearch.conf - add
     HEAD method verb
   * Revamp of Travis and coverage automated testing
   * Added a space between IP address and the following colon
     in notification emails for easier text selection
   * Character detection heuristics for whois output via optional setting
     in mail-whois*.conf. Thanks Thomas Mayer.
     Not enabled by default, if _whois_command is set to be
     %(_whois_convert_charset)s (e.g. in action.d/mail-whois-common.local),
     it
     - detects character set of whois output (which is undefined by
       RFC 3912) via heuristics of the file command
     - converts whois data to UTF-8 character set with iconv
     - sends the whois output in UTF-8 character set to mail program
     - avoids that heirloom mailx creates binary attachment for input with
       unknown character set

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul  2 06:38:00 UTC 2015 - jweberhofer@weberhofer.at

- Note: fail2ban-issue_906-strptime.patch has been removed as it is already
  integrated in the current version.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun  8 13:27:00 UTC 2015 - jweberhofer@weberhofer.at

- Removed "backend" setting from paths-opensuse.conf

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May  8 14:01:31 UTC 2015 - jweberhofer@weberhofer.at

- Update to version 0.9.2 (requested in boo#917818)

  Read the full changelog in /usr/share/doc/packages/fail2ban/ChangeLog

  Here are some notes to be read when updating existing installations:

  The default log-backend for openssue 13.2+ is now systemd

  * jail.conf was heavily refactored and now is similar to how it looked on
    Debian systems:
    - default action could be configured once for all jails
    - jails definitions only provide customizations (port, logpath)
    - no need to specify 'filter' if name matches jail name

  * Added fail2ban persistent database
    - default location at /var/lib/fail2ban/fail2ban.sqlite3
    - allows active bans to be reinstated on restart
    - log files read from last position after restart

  * Added systemd journal backend
    - Dependency on python-systemd
    - New "journalmatch" option added to filter configs files
    - New "systemd-journal" option added to fail2ban-regex

  * Support %z (Timezone offset) and %f (sub-seconds) support for datedetector.
    Enhanced existing date/time have been updated patterns to support these.
    ISO8601 now defaults to localtime unless specified otherwise.  Some filters
    have been change as required to capture these elements in the right
    timezone correctly.

  * Log levels are now set by Syslog style strings e.g. DEBUG, ERROR.

  * Optionally can read log files starting from "head" or "tail". See "logpath"
    option in jail.conf(5) man page.

  * Can now set log encoding for files per jail.Default uses systemd locale.

  * iptables-common.conf replaced iptables-blocktype.conf
    (iptables-blocktype.local should still be read) and now also provides
    defaults for the chain, port, protocol and name tags

- Require whois

Security note: The update to version 0.8.11 has fixed two additional security
issues: A remote unauthenticated attacker may cause arbitrary IP addresses to
be blocked by Fail2ban causing legitimate users to be blocked from accessing
services protected by Fail2ban. CVE-2013-7177 (cyrus-imap) and CVE-2013-7176
(postfix)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 23 21:35:27 UTC 2014 - jweberhofer@weberhofer.at

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan 22 09:27:43 UTC 2014 - jweberhofer@weberhofer.at

- Use new flushlogs syntax after logrotate

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan 22 08:50:05 UTC 2014 - jweberhofer@weberhofer.at

- Update to version 0.8.12

  * Log rotation can now occur with the command "flushlogs" rather than
    reloading fail2ban or keeping the logtarget settings consistent in
    jail.conf/local and /etc/logrotate.d/fail2ban. (dep#697333, rh#891798).

  * Added ignorecommand option for allowing dynamic determination as to ignore
    and IP or not.

  * Remove indentation of name and loglevel while logging to SYSLOG to resolve
    syslog(-ng) parsing problems. (dep#730202). Log lines now also
    report "[PID]" after the name portion too.

  * Epoch dates can now be enclosed within []

  * New actions: badips, firewallcmd-ipset, ufw, blocklist_de

  * New filters: solid-pop3d, nsd, openwebmail, horde, freeswitch, squid,
    ejabberd, openwebmail, groupoffice

  * Filter improvements:
    - apache-noscript now includes php cgi scripts
    - exim-spam filter to match spamassassin log entry for option SAdevnull.
    - Added to sshd filter expression for 
      "Received disconnect from : 3: Auth fail"
    - Improved ACL-handling for Asterisk
    - Added improper command pipelining to postfix filter.

  * General fixes:
    - Added lots of jail.conf entries for missing filters that creaped in 
      over the last year.
    - synchat changed to use push method which verifies whether all data was
      send. This ensures that all data is sent before closing the connection.
    - Fixed python 2.4 compatibility (as sub-second in date patterns weren't 
      2.4 compatible)
    - Complain/email actions fixed to only include relevant IPs to reporting

  * Filter fixes:
    - Added HTTP referrer bit of the apache access log to the apache filters.
    - Apache 2.4 perfork regexes fixed
    - Kernel syslog expression can have leading spaces
    - allow for ",milliseconds" in the custom date format of proftpd.log
    - recidive jail to block all protocols
    - smtps not a IANA standard so may be missing from /etc/services. Due to 
      (still) common use 465 has been used as the explicit port number
    - Filter dovecot reordered session and TLS items in regex with wider scope
      for session characters

  * Ugly Fixes (Potentially incompatible changes):

    - Unfortunately at the end of last release when the action
      firewall-cmd-direct-new was added it was too long and had a broken action
      check. The action was renamed to firewallcmd-new to fit within jail name
      name length. (gh#fail2ban/fail2ban#395).

    - Last release added mysqld-syslog-iptables as a jail configuration. This
      jailname was too long and it has been renamed to mysqld-syslog.

- Fixed formating of github references in changelog
- reformatted spec-file
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov 14 05:14:35 UTC 2013 - jweberhofer@weberhofer.at

- Update to version 0.8.11

- In light of CVE-2013-2178 that triggered our last release we have put a
  significant effort into tightening all of the regexs of our filters to avoid
  another similar vulnerability. We haven't examined all of these for a potential
  DoS scenario however it is possible that another DoS vulnerability exists that
  is fixed by this release. A large number of filters have been updated to
  include more failure regexs supporting previously unbanned failures and support
  newer application versions too. We have test cases for most of these now
  however if you have other examples that demonstrate that a filter is
  insufficient we welcome your feedback. During the tightening of the regexs to
  avoid DoS vulnerabilities there is the possibility that we have inadvertently,
  despite our best intentions, incorrectly allowed a failure to continue.

Thu Dec  6 15:32:02 UTC 2012 - jweberhofer@weberhofer.at

crafted some custom action which uses it -- you must upgrade, or you
would be at a significant security risk.
