Tue Feb 11 16:56:58 UTC 2025 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 10.1:
  + Due to a couple of unfortunate but important regressions in
    Fractal 10, we are releasing Fractal 10.1 so our users don’t
    have to wait too long for them to be addressed. This minor
    version fixes the following issues:
    - Some rooms were stuck in an unread state, even after reading
      them or marking them as read.
    - Joining or creating a room would crash the app.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan 31 22:16:41 UTC 2025 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 10:
  + The QR code scanning code has been ported to libaperture, the
    library behind GNOME Camera. This should result in better
    performance and more reliability.
  + OAuth 2.0 compatibility was added, to make sure that we are
    ready for the upcoming authentication changes for matrix.org.
  + Pills for users and rooms mentions show consistently in the
    right place instead of seemingly random places, getting rid of
    one of our oldest and most annoying bug.
  + Attachments go through the send queue, ensuring correct order
    of all messages and improving the visual feedback.
  + Videos were often not playing after loading in the room
    history. This was fixed, and we also show properly when an
    error occurred.
  + We were downloading too many different sizes for avatar images,
    which would fill the media cache needlessly. We now only
    download a couple of sizes. This has the extra benefit of
    fixing blurry or missing thumbnails in notifications.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan 17 10:58:59 UTC 2025 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 10.rc:
  + The most next-gen addition goes to… making Fractal OIDC aware.
    This ensures compatibility with the upcoming authentication
    changes for matrix.org.
  + The most valuable fix goes to… showing consistently pills for
    users and rooms mentions in the right place instead of
    seemingly random places, getting rid of one of our oldest and
    most annoying bug.
  + The most sensible improvement goes to… using the send queue for
    attachments, ensuring correct order of all messages and
    improving the visual feedback.
  + The most underrated feature goes to… allowing to react to
    stickers, fixing a crash in the process.
  + The most obvious tweak goes to… removing the “Open Direct Chat”
    menu entry from avatar menu and member profile in direct chats.
  + The clearest enhancement goes to… labelling experimental
    versions in the room upgrade menu as such.
  + As usual, this release includes other improvements and fixes.
  + Updated translations.
- Add pkgconfig(gstgtk4), pkgconfig(lcms2), rubygem(sass) and
  rust-grass BuildRequires: New dependencies.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan  6 19:36:16 UTC 2025 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Add explicit gstreamer-plugins-good-gtk Requires: Ensure this
  runtime dependency is in place (boo#1191723).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov 13 09:11:51 UTC 2024 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 9:
  * We switched to the glycin library (the same one used by GNOME
    Image Viewer) to load images, allowing us to fix several
    issues, like supporting more animated formats and SVGs and
    respecting EXIF orientation.
  * The annoying bug where some rooms would stay as unread even
    after opening them is now a distant memory.
  * The media cache uses its own database that you can delete if
    you want to free some space on your system. It will also soon
    be able to clean up unused media files to prevent it from
    growing indefinitely.
  * Sometimes the day separators would show up with the wrong date,
    not anymore!
  * We migrated to the new GTK 4.16 and libadwaita 1.6 APIs,
    including CSS variables, AdwButtonRow and AdwSpinner.
  * We used to only rely on the secrets provider to tell us which
    Matrix accounts are logged-in, which caused issues for people
    sharing their secrets between devices. Now we also make sure
    that there is a data folder for a given session before trying
    to restore it.
  * Our notifications are categorized as coming from an instant
    messenger, so graphical shells that support it, such as Phosh,
    can play a sound for them.
  * Some room settings are hidden for direct chats, because it does
    not make sense to change them in this type of room.
  * The size of the headerbar would change depending on whether the
    room has a topic or not. This will not happen anymore.
- Update URL and source service url to new home.
- Add pkgconfig(libseccomp) and pkgconfig(libwebp) BuildRequires:
  New dependencies.
- Add explicit glycin-loaders Requires: New runtime dependency.
- Drop obsolete and unneeded update-desktop-files BuildRequires and
  macro.
- Disable LTO via _lto_cflags %{nil} define, FTBFS without.
- Build for %{rust_tier1_arches} instead of only x86_64.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug  1 16:28:28 UTC 2024 - Richard Rahl <rrahl0@opensuse.org>

- update to version 8:
  * Mentions are sent intentionally
  * Authenticated media are supported
  * Draft messages are kept per-room and persisted across restarts
  * More links are detected in messages and room descriptions
  * Collapsed categories in the sidebar are remembered between restarts
  * A banner appears when synchronization with the homeserver fails
    too many times in a row
  * The verification and account recovery processes have been polished
  * HTML rendering has been improved, with the support of new
    elements and attributes

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May  3 01:32:44 UTC 2024 - Richard Rahl <rrahl0@disroot.org>

- update to version 7:
  * Messages that failed to send can now be retried or discarded.
  * Messages can be reported to server admins for moderation.
  * Room details are now considered complete, with the addition of room address
    management, permissions, and room upgrade.
  * A new member menu appears when clicking on an avatar in the room history.
    It offers a quick way to do many actions related to that person,
    including opening a direct chat with them and moderating them.
  * Pills are clickable and allow to directly go to a room or member profile.
  * Account recovery, introduced during this cycle, could lead to an unclear
    situation where it was still incomplete even after successfully going
    through the process
  * After fixing a focus issue upstream in GtkListView, we got rid of more
    focus issues in our widgets. That should make the room history completely
    accessible with keyboard navigation.
  * Third party verification, that happens in a direct chat, was partly broken
    as the banner about an ongoing verification was not showing up anymore.
    The culprit was found and we took that opportunity to improve the security
    instructions. Along with this bugfix, a coat of polish has been applied.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 29 10:39:40 UTC 2024 - Richard Rahl <rrahl0@proton.me>

  + Room details are now considered complete, with the addition of room
    address management, permissions, and version upgrade.
  + A new member menu appears when clicking on an avatar in the room history.
    It offers a quick way to do many actions related to that person, including
    opening a direct chat with them and moderating them.
  + Pills are clickable and allow to directly go to a room or member profile.
  + improvements on the accessibility front, for better navigability with a

Sat Aug 19 01:57:20 UTC 2023 - Luciano Santos <luc14n0@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 5.beta2:
  + Second beta release since the rewrite of Fractal to take
    advantage of GTK 4 and the Matrix Rust SDK, an effort that
    started in March 2021.
  + The most visible changes since Fractal 5.beta1 are:
    - Editing text messages.
    - Logging in with homeservers that don’t support
      auto-discovery.
    - A refactor of the login flow should avoid crashes when going
      back at any step.
    - Sometimes two day dividers would appear next to each other
      without messages between them, this is now fixed.
  + Of course, there are also a lot of less visible changes,
    notably a lot of refactoring and fixes.
  + Updated translations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug 11 00:23:34 UTC 2023 - Luciano Santos <luc14n0@opensuse.org>
