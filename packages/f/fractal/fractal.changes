- update to version 7:
  * Messages that failed to send can now be retried or discarded.
  * Messages can be reported to server admins for moderation.
  * Room details are now considered complete, with the addition of room address
    management, permissions, and room upgrade.
  * A new member menu appears when clicking on an avatar in the room history.
    It offers a quick way to do many actions related to that person,
    including opening a direct chat with them and moderating them.
  * Pills are clickable and allow to directly go to a room or member profile.
  * Account recovery, introduced during this cycle, could lead to an unclear
    situation where it was still incomplete even after successfully going
    through the process
  * After fixing a focus issue upstream in GtkListView, we got rid of more
    focus issues in our widgets. That should make the room history completely
    accessible with keyboard navigation.
  * Third party verification, that happens in a direct chat, was partly broken
    as the banner about an ongoing verification was not showing up anymore.
    The culprit was found and we took that opportunity to improve the security
    instructions. Along with this bugfix, a coat of polish has been applied.

Sat Aug 19 01:57:20 UTC 2023 - Luciano Santos <luc14n0@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 5.beta2:
  + Second beta release since the rewrite of Fractal to take
    advantage of GTK 4 and the Matrix Rust SDK, an effort that
    started in March 2021.

    - Editing text messages.
    - Logging in with homeservers that don’t support
      auto-discovery.
    - A refactor of the login flow should avoid crashes when going
      back at any step.
    - Sometimes two day dividers would appear next to each other
      without messages between them, this is now fixed.
  + Of course, there are also a lot of less visible changes,
    notably a lot of refactoring and fixes.
  + Updated translations.
