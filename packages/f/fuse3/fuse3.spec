%description
FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) is an interface by the Linux kernel
for userspace programs to export a filesystem to the kernel.

This package contains helper programs for using FUSE mounts.

FUSE file systems are typically implemented as a standalone
applications in their own right and are packaged separately.

%description -n libfuse3-3
FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) is an interface by the Linux kernel
for userspace programs to export a filesystem to the kernel.

A FUSE file system is typically implemented as a standalone
application that links with libfuse. libfuse provides a C API over
the raw kernel interface.

This package contains all include files, libraries and configuration
files needed to develop programs that use the fuse (FUSE) library to
implement file systems in user space.

With fuse-devel, users can compile and install other user space file
systems.
