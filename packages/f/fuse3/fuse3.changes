- Update to release 3.13.1
  * Fixed an issue that resulted in errors when attempting to
    compile against installed libfuse headers (because libc
    symbol versioning support was not detected correctly in this
    case).
- Add 0001-Split-config.h-into-private-and-public-config.patch
  to fix doubly-defined macros and build failure elsewhere.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan 13 21:23:26 UTC 2023 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 3.13
  * There is a new low-level API function fuse_session_custom_io
    that allows to implement a daemon with a custom io. This can
    be used to create a daemon that can process incoming FUSE
    requests to other destinations than /dev/fuse.
  * A deadlock when resolving paths in the high-level API has
    been fixed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep  8 12:41:23 UTC 2022 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 3.12.0

    of the new max_threads* parameter
  * struct fuse_loop_config is now private and has to be
    constructed using fuse_loop_cfg_create()

    as NULL pointer.
  * fuse_parse_cmdline() now accepts a max_threads option.

- Update to release 3.10.2
  * Allow "nonempty" as a mount option, for backwards
    compatibility with fusermount 2. The option has no effect
    since mounting over non-empty directories is allowed by default.
  * FUSE filesystems can now be mounted underneath EXFAT
    mountpoints.

    prototype with unsigned int commands.
  * Various small bugfixes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- Update to version 3.6.1
  * Fixed version number (release 3.6.0 was shipped with a declared
    version of 3.0.0).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun 13 12:07:16 UTC 2019 - Ismail Dönmez <idonmez@suse.com>

- Update to version 3.6.0
  * Added a new example (passthrough_hp). The functionality is
    similar to passthrough_ll, but the implementation focuses
    on performance and correctness rather than simplicity.
  * Added support for fuse kernel feature max_pages which allows
    to increase the maximum number of pages that can be used per
    request. This feature was introduced in kernel 4.20.
    max_pages is set based on the value in max_write. 
    By default max_write will be 1MiB now for kernels that
    support max_pages. If you want smaller buffers or writes
    you have to set max_write manually.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr 17 07:48:52 UTC 2019 - Paolo Stivanin <info@paolostivanin.com>

- Update to 3.5.0:
  * Changed ioctl commands to "unsigned int" in order to support
    commands which do not fit into a signed int. Commands issued
    by applications are still truncated to 32 bits.
  * Added SMB2 to whitelist (so users can now mount FUSE
    filesystems on mountpoints within SMB 2.0 filesystems).
  * Added a new cache_readdir flag to fuse_file_info to enable
    caching of readdir results. Supported by kernels 4.20 and newer.
  * Add support and documentation for FUSE_CAP_NO_OPENDIR_SUPPORT.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov 29 08:30:24 UTC 2018 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Do not make documentation mandatory.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov 26 13:22:12 UTC 2018 - Ismail Dönmez <idonmez@suse.com>

- Update to version 3.3.0
  * The auto_unmount mode now works correctly in combination with
    autofs.
  * The FUSE_CAP_READDIRPLUS_AUTO capability is no longer enabled by
    default unless the file system defines both a readdir() and a
    readdirplus() handler.
  * The description of the FUSE_CAP_READDIRPLUS_AUTO flag has been
    improved.
  * Allow open /dev/fuse file descriptors to be passed via mountpoints
    of the special format /dev/fd/%u. This allows mounting to be
    handled by the parent so the FUSE filesystem process can run
    fully unprivileged.
  * Add a drop_privileges option to mount.fuse3 which causes it to open
    /dev/fuse and mount the file system itself, then run the FUSE file
    filesystem fully unprivileged and unable to re-acquire privilege
    via setuid, fscaps, etc.
  * Documented under which conditions the fuse_lowlevel_notify_*
    functions may block.
  * The chmod, chown, truncate, utimens and getattr handlers of
    the high-level API now all receive an additional struct
    fuse_file_info pointer. There are more API changes, consult
    https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse/releases/tag/fuse-3.3.0
    for details.
