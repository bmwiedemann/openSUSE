Thu Jun 13 12:07:16 UTC 2019 - Ismail Dönmez <idonmez@suse.com>

- Update to version 3.6.0
  * Added a new example (passthrough_hp). The functionality is
    similar to passthrough_ll, but the implementation focuses
    on performance and correctness rather than simplicity.
  * Added support for fuse kernel feature max_pages which allows
    to increase the maximum number of pages that can be used per
    request. This feature was introduced in kernel 4.20.
    max_pages is set based on the value in max_write. 
    By default max_write will be 1MiB now for kernels that
    support max_pages. If you want smaller buffers or writes
    you have to set max_write manually.

    commands which do not fit into a signed int. Commands issued
    by applications are still truncated to 32 bits.
  * Added SMB2 to whitelist (so users can now mount FUSE
    filesystems on mountpoints within SMB 2.0 filesystems).
  * Added a new cache_readdir flag to fuse_file_info to enable
    caching of readdir results. Supported by kernels 4.20 and newer.
  * Add support and documentation for FUSE_CAP_NO_OPENDIR_SUPPORT.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov 26 13:22:12 UTC 2018 - Ismail Dönmez <idonmez@suse.com>

- Update to version 3.3.0
  * The auto_unmount mode now works correctly in combination with
    autofs.
  * The FUSE_CAP_READDIRPLUS_AUTO capability is no longer enabled by
    default unless the file system defines both a readdir() and a
    readdirplus() handler.
  * The description of the FUSE_CAP_READDIRPLUS_AUTO flag has been
    improved.
  * Allow open /dev/fuse file descriptors to be passed via mountpoints
    of the special format /dev/fd/%u. This allows mounting to be
    handled by the parent so the FUSE filesystem process can run
    fully unprivileged.
  * Add a drop_privileges option to mount.fuse3 which causes it to open
    /dev/fuse and mount the file system itself, then run the FUSE file
    filesystem fully unprivileged and unable to re-acquire privilege
    via setuid, fscaps, etc.
  * Documented under which conditions the fuse_lowlevel_notify_*
    functions may block.
  * The chmod, chown, truncate, utimens and getattr handlers of
    the high-level API now all receive an additional struct
    fuse_file_info pointer. There are more API changes, consult
    https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse/releases/tag/fuse-3.3.0
    for details.
