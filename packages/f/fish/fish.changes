Thu Apr  4 09:09:34 UTC 2024 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 3.7.1:
  * Deleting the last history entry via `history delete` works
    again (#10190).
  * Wildcards (`*`) will no longer sometimes generate paths that
    did not exist (#10205).
  * A crash when trying to run an ELF program with a missing
    interpreter has been fixed. This crashed in the process after
    fork, so did not affect the fish process that tried to start
    the program (#10199).
  * `funced` will now always `source` the file after it has
    written it, even if the contents did not change. This
    prevents issues if the file was otherwise modified (#10318).
  * The warning for when a builtin returns a negative exit code
    was improved, now mentioning the original status (#10187).
  * Added completions for `cobra-cli`, `dmidecode`, `mycli`,
    `ollama`, `pstree`

Mon Jan 1 18:42:02 UTC 2024 - Victorhck <victorhck@opensuse.org>

- Update to 3.7.0:
  * The history pager will now also attempt subsequence matches (#9476),
    so you can find a command line like git log 3.6.1..Integration_3.7.0 by searching for gitInt.
  * Opening the history pager will now fill the search field with a search string if you’re already
    in a search (#10005). This makes it nicer to search something with ↑ and then later decide
    to switch to the full pager.
  * Closing the history pager with enter will now copy the search text to the commandline
    if there was no match, so you can continue editing the command you tried to find right away (#9934).
  * Performance improvements for command completions and globbing, where supported by the operating system,
    especially on slow filesystems such as NFS (#9891, #9931, #10032, #10052).
  * fish can now be configured to wait a specified amount of time for a multi-key sequence to be completed,
    instead of waiting indefinitely. For example, this makes binding kj to switching modes in vi mode possible.
    The timeout can be set via the new fish_sequence_key_delay_ms variable (#7401),
    and may be set by default in future versions.

Wed Dec  6 12:42:56 UTC 2023 - Dan Čermák <dcermak@suse.com>

- New upstream release 3.6.4

  * This release contains a complete fix for the test suite failure in fish
    3.6.2 and 3.6.3.

- New upstream release 3.6.3

  * This release contains a fix for a test suite failure in fish 3.6.2.

- New upstream release 3.6.2

  This release of fish contains a security fix for CVE-2023-49284, a minor security problem identified
  in fish 3.6.1 and previous versions (thought to affect all released versions of fish).

  fish uses certain Unicode non-characters internally for marking wildcards and expansions. It
  incorrectly allowed these markers to be read on command substitution output, rather than
  transforming them into a safe internal representation.

  For example, ``echo \UFDD2HOME`` has the same output as ``echo $HOME``.

  While this may cause unexpected behavior with direct input, this may become a minor security problem
  if the output is being fed from an external program into a command substitution where this output
  may not be expected. (bsc#1217808, CVE-2023-49284)

Tue Apr 18 03:15:56 UTC 2023 - Luciano Santos <luc14n0@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 3.6.1:
  * The Web-based configuration for abbreviations has been removed,
    as it was not functional with the changes abbreviations
    introduced in 3.6.0.
  * 'read' will now print an error if told to set a read-only
    variable, instead of silently doing nothing.
  * 'set_color -v' no longer crashes fish.
  * Using fish_vi_key_bindings in combination with fish's
    --no-config mode works without locking up the shell.
  * The history pager now uses more screen space, usually half the
    screen.
  * Variables that were set while the locale was C (the default
    ASCII-only locale) will now properly be encoded if the locale
    is switched.
  * Escape during history search restores the original command line
    again.
  * Using --help on builtins now respects the $MANPAGER variable,
    in preference to $PAGER.
  * The documentation for the ':', '[' and '.' builtin commands can
    now be looked up with 'man'.
  * fish no longer crashes when searching history for non-ASCII
    codepoints case-insensitively.
  * Themes that don't specify every color option can be installed
    correctly in the Web-based configuration.
  * Compatibility with Midnight Commander's prompt integration has
    been improved.
  * A spurious error, noted when using fish in Google Drive
    directories under WSL 2, has been silenced.
  * Using 'read' in 'fish_greeting' or similar functions will not
    trigger an infinite loop.
  * The git prompt will compute the stash count to be used
    independently of the informative status.
  * Added completions for: apkanalyzer, neovim, otool, pre-commit,
    proxychains, scrypt, stow, trash and helper utilities
    (trash-empty, trash-list, trash-put and trash-restore) and
    ssh-copy-id.
  * Improvements to many completions, including the speed of
    completing directories in WSL 2.
  * Completions using __fish_complete_suffix are now offered in
    the correct order (regression).
  * 'git' completions for 'git-foo'-style commands was restored
    (regression).
  * File completion now offers ../ and ./ again (regression).
  * Improvements and corrections to the documentation.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan 17 11:23:02 UTC 2023 - Paolo Stivanin <info@paolostivanin.com>

- update to 3.6.0:
  * By default, Control-R now opens the command history in the pager,
  * Abbrevations are more flexible
  * The \\x and \\X escape syntax is now equivalent. \\xAB previously
    behaved the same as \\XAB, except that it would error if the value “AB” was larger than “7f”
  * The fish_git_prompt will now only turn on features if the appropriate
    variable has been set to a true value (of “1”, “yes” or “true”)
    instead of just checking if it is defined.
  * Abbreviations are no longer stored in universal variables.
  * The short option -r for abbreviations has changed from rename to regex,
    for consistency with string.
  * argparse can now be used without option specifications, to allow using
    --min-args, --max-args or for commands that take no options
  * set --show now shows when a variable was inherited from fish’s parent process,
    which should help with debugging
  * The read limit is now restored to the default when fish_read_limit is unset
  * fish_clipboard_copy and fish_clipboard_paste can now be used in pipes
  * A new variable, fish_cursor_selection_mode, can be used to configure whether
    the command line selection includes the character under the cursor (inclusive) or not (exclusive)
  * The complete-and-search binding, used with Shift-Tab by default,
    selects the first item in the results immediately
  * The key combination for the QUIT terminal sequence, often Control-Backslash (\\x1c),
    can now be sused as a binding
  * commandline gained two new options, --selection-start and --selection-end,
    to set the start/end of the current selection

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul 22 21:30:27 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 3.5.1:
  * Cursor shaping for Vi mode is enabled by default in tmux,
    and will be used if the outer terminal is capable
  * ``printf`` returns a better error when used with arguments
    interpreted as octal numbers
  * ``history merge`` when in private mode is now an error,
    rather than wiping out other sessions' history
  * The error message when launching a command that is built
    for the wrong architecture on macOS is more helpful

- version update to 3.5.0
  * A new path builtin command to filter and transform paths (#7659, #8958).
  * Tab (or any key bound to complete) now expands wildcards instead of
    invoking completions, if there is a wildcard in the path component under
    the cursor (#954, #8593).
  * Scripts can now catch and handle the SIGINT and SIGTERM signals, either via
    function --on-signal or with trap (#6649).
  * see https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/releases/tag/3.5.0

  * An error printed after upgrading, where old instances could pick up a newer
    version of the fish_title function, has been fixed (#8778)
  * fish builds correctly on NetBSD (#8788) and OpenIndiana (#8780).
  * nextd-or-forward-word, bound to Alt-Right Arrow by default, was
    inadvertently changed to move like forward-bigword. This has been
    corrected (#8790).
  * funcsave -q and funcsave --quiet now work correctly (#8830).
  * Issues with the csharp and nmcli completions were corrected.
  * see https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/releases/tag/3.4.1

Mon Mar 21 13:20:42 UTC 2022 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Add 8784-old-school-cmd-subst.patch fixing fish_title.fish

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 16 06:35:37 UTC 2022 - pgajdos@suse.com

- version update to 3.4.0

  * fish’s command substitution syntax has been extended: $(cmd) now
    has the same meaning as (cmd) but it can be used inside double
    quotes, to prevent line splitting of the results (#159)
  * Complementing the prompt command in 3.3.0, fish_config gained
    a theme subcommand to show and pick from the sample themes
    (meaning color schemes) directly in the terminal, instead of
    having to open a Web browser.
  * set and read learned a new option, --function, to set a variable
    in the function’s top scope. This should be a more familiar way
    of scoping variables and avoids issues with --local, which is
    actually block-scoped (#565, #8145)
  * string pad now excludes escape sequences like colors that fish
    knows about, and a new --visible flag to string length makes
    it use that kind of visible width. This is useful to get the
    number of terminal cells an already colored string would occupy,
    like in a prompt. (#8182, #7784, #4012)
  * Performance improvements to globbing, especially on systems
    using glibc. In some cases (large directories with files with
    many numbers in the names) this almost halves the time taken
    to expand the glob.
  * Autosuggestions can now be turned off by setting
    $fish_autosuggestion_enabled to 0, and (almost) all highlighting
    can be turned off by choosing the new “None” theme. The exception
    is necessary colors, like those which distinguish autosuggestions
    from the actual command line. (#8376)
  * The fish_git_prompt function, which is included in the default
    prompts, now overrides git to avoid running commands set by
    per-repository configuration. This avoids a potential security
    issue in some circumstances, and has been assigned CVE-2022-20001
    (#8589). [bsc#1197139]

Fri Feb 25 09:35:44 UTC 2022 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- We don't need to remove unnecessary completions (curl and pyenv
  in this case), the ones in /usr/share/fish/vendor_completions.d
  have precedence. Now just to make all other packages put theirs
  in the right location!

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 2 20:39:41 UTC 2021 - Victorhck <victorhck@opensuse.org>

- Update to 3.3.1:
  * The prompt and command line are redrawn correctly in response to universal variable changes.
  * A superfluous error that was produced when setting the PATH or CDPATH environment variables to include colon-delimited components that do not exist was removed.
  * The Vi mode indicator in the prompt is repainted correctly after Ctrl-C cancels the current command.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Apr 18 22:39:41 UTC 2021 - Avindra Goolcharan <avindra@opensuse.org>

- Update to 3.2.2:
  * Background jobs no longer interfere with syntax highlighting (fish 3.2.1 regression)
  * The command-not-found handler used suggestions from pacman on Arch
    Linux, but this caused major slowdowns on some systems and has been disabled
  * Certain programs (such as lazygit) could create situations where
    fish would not receive keystrokes correctly, but it is now more
    robust in these situations
  * Completions for aura and tshark should no longer produce errors.
  * fish will no longer hang on exit if another process is in the foreground
    on macOS
  * Arguments longer than 1024 characters no longer trigger excessive
    CPU usage on macOS

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar 18 17:40:37 UTC 2021 - Avindra Goolcharan <avindra@opensuse.org>

-  Update to 3.2.1:
  * Commands in key bindings are run with fish's internal terminal
    modes, instead of the terminal modes typically used for commands.
    This fixes a bug introduced in 3.2.0, where text would unexpectedly
    appear on the terminal, especially when pasting
  * Prompts which use the internal __fish_print_pipestatus function will
    display correctly rather than carrying certain modifiers (such as
    bold) further than intended
  * Redirections to internal file descriptors is allowed again, reversing
    the changes in 3.2.0. This fixes a problem with Midnight Commander
  * Universal variables should be fully reliable regardless of operating
    system again
  * fish_git_prompt no longer causes screen flickering in certain terminals
  * fish_add_path manipulates the fish_user_paths variable correctly
    when moving multiple paths
  * Pasting with a multi-line command no longer causes
     __fish_tokenizer_state error
  * psub inside event handlers cleans up temporary files properly
  * Event handlers declared with --on-job-exit $fish_pid no longer run
    constantly, although these functions should use --on-event fish_exit
    instead.
  * Changing terminal modes inside config.fish works
  * set_color --print-colors no longer prints all colors in bold
  * Completing commands starting with a - no longer prints an error
  * Running fish_command_not_found directly no longer produces an error
    on macOS or other OSes which do not have a handler available
  * The new type builtin now has the (deprecated) --quiet long form of -q
  * help and fish_config work correctly when fish is running in a Chrome
    OS Crostini Linux VM
  * The history file can be made a symbolic link without it being overwritten,
    matching a similar improvement for the universal variable file in 3.2.0.
  * An unhelpful error ("access: No error"), seen on Cygwin, is no longer produced
  * Improvements to the rsync completions, some completion descriptions,
    and completions that use IP address
  * Improvements to the appearance of fish_config
- explicitly list binaries in spec file

- Define GenericName and proper category in fish.desktop

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar  1 15:43:22 UTC 2021 - Paolo Stivanin <info@paolostivanin.com>

- Update to 3.2.0:
  * Undo and redo support for the command-line editor and pager search
  * Builtins can now output before all data is read
  * Prompts will now be truncated instead of replaced with "> "
  * Better errors with "test"
  * A new theme for the documentation and Web-based configuration
  * fish --no-execute will no longer complain about unknown commands
    or non-matching wildcards
  * string match --regex now integrates named PCRE2 capture groups
    as fish variables
  * Globs and other expansions are limited to 512,288 results
  * A new "fish for bash users" documentation page gives a quick overview
    of the scripting differences between bash and fish
  * Range limits in index range expansions like $x[$start..$end]
    may be omitted: $start and $end default to 1 and -1
  * the type, _ (gettext), . (source) and : (no-op) functions
    are now implemented builtins for performance purposes
  * The output for set --show has been shortened
  * string sub has a new --end option to specify the end index of
    a substring
  * string trim now also trims vertical tabs by default
  * string repeat now handles multiple arguments, repeating each one
  * The true and false builtins ignore any arguments
  * status gained new dirname and basename convenience subcommands
  * jobs now shows continued child processes correctly
  * A new fish_status_to_signal function for transforming exit statuses
    to signal names has been added
  * fish -c now reads the remaining arguments into $argv
  * The pwd command supports the long options --logical and --physical

Thu Apr 30 08:16:41 UTC 2020 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 3.1.2:
  * Commands such as fzf and enhancd, when used with eval, would
    hang. eval buffered output too aggressively, which has been
	fixed (#6955).
- Changes in 3.1.2:
  * Commands which involve . ( ... | psub) now work correctly, as
    a bug in the function --on-job-exit option has been fixed (#6613).
  * Conflicts between upstream packages for ripgrep and bat, and the
    fish packages, have been resolved (#5822).
  * Starting fish in a directory without read access, such as via
    su, no longer crashes (#6597).
  * Glob ordering changes which were introduced in 3.1.0 have been
    reverted, returning the order of globs to the previous state (#6593).
  * Redirections using the deprecated caret syntax to a file
    descriptor (eg ^&2) work correctly (#6591).
  * Redirections that append to a file descriptor (eg 2>>&1)
    work correctly (#6614).
  * Building fish on macOS (#6602) or with new versions of GCC
    (#6604, #6609) is now successful.
  * time is now correctly listed in the output of builtin -n,
    and time --help works correctly (#6598).
  * Exported universal variables now update properly (#6612).
  * status current-command gives the expected output when used
    with an environment override - that is, F=B status current-command
    returns status instead of F=B (#6635).
  * test no longer crashes when used with "nan" or "inf" arguments,
    erroring out instead (#6655).
  * Copying from the end of the command line no longer crashes
    fish (#6680).
  * read no longer removes multiple separators when splitting a
    variable into a list, restoring the previous behaviour from fish
    3.0 and before (#6650).
  * Functions using --on-job-exit and --on-process-exit work
    reliably again (#6679).
  * Functions using --on-signal INT work reliably in interactive
    sessions, as they did in fish 2.7 and before (#6649). These handlers
    have never worked in non-interactive sessions, and making them
    work is an ongoing process.
  * Functions using --on-variable work reliably with variables which
    are set implicitly (rather than with set), such as
    "fish_bind_mode" and "PWD" (#6653).
  * 256 colors are properly enabled under certain conditions that were
    incorrectly detected in fish 3.1.0 ($TERM begins with xterm, does
    not include "256color", and $TERM_PROGRAM is not set) (#6701).
  * The Mercurial (hg) prompt no longer produces an error when the
    current working directory is removed (#6699). Also, for performance
    reasons it shows only basic information by default; to restore the
    detailed status, set $fish_prompt_hg_show_informative_status.
  * The VCS prompt, fish_vcs_prompt, no longer displays Subversion (svn)
    status by default, due to the potential slowness of this operation (#6681).
  * Pasting of commands has been sped up (#6713).
  * Using extended Unicode characters, such as emoji, in a non-Unicode
    capable locale (such as the C or POSIX locale) no longer renders
    all output blank (#6736).
  * help prefers to use xdg-open, avoiding the use of open on Debian
    systems where this command is actually openvt (#6739).
  * Command lines starting with a space, which are not saved in history,
    now do not get autosuggestions. This fixes an issue with Midnight
    Commander integration (#6763), but may be changed in a future version.
  * Copying to the clipboard no longer inserts a newline at the end of the
    content, matching fish 2.7 and earlier (#6927).
  * fzf in complex pipes no longer hangs. More generally, code run as
    part of command substitutions or eval will no longer have separate
    process groups. (#6624, #6806).

* fish's debugging arguments have been significantly improved
* new builtin command, time, which allows timing of fish functions
  and builtins as well as external commands
* Brace expansion now only takes place if the braces include a "," or

Sat Nov 25 15:23:31 UTC 2017 - jaime.marquinez.ferrandiz@fastmail.net

- Update to 2.7.0. Notable improvements:
  * A new cdh (change directory using recent history) command provides a more
    friendly alternative to prevd/nextd and pushd/popd (#2847).
  * A new argparse command is available to allow fish script to parse arguments
    with the same behavior as builtin commands. This also includes the fish_opt helper command. (#4190).
  * Invalid array indexes are now silently ignored (#826, #4127).
  * Improvements to the debugging facility, including a prompt specific to the
    debugger (fish_breakpoint_prompt) and a status is-breakpoint subcommand (#1310).
  * string supports new lower and upper subcommands, for altering the case of
    strings (#4080). The case changing is not locale-aware yet.
  * string escape has a new --style=xxx flag where xxx can be script, var,
    or url (#4150), and can be reversed with string unescape (#3543).
  * History can now be split into sessions with the fish_history variable,
    or not saved to disk at all (#102).
  * Read history is now controlled by the fish_history variable rather than
    the --mode-name flag (#1504).
  * command now supports an --all flag to report all directories with the
    command. which is no longer a runtime dependency (#2778).
  * fish can run commands before starting an interactive session using the new
    --init-command/-C options (#4164).
  * set has a new --show option to show lots of information about variables
    (#4265).
  * Full changelog: https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/releases/tag/2.7.0

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun  7 22:56:22 UTC 2017 - vilene@posteo.net

- Update to 2.6.0. Notable fixes and improvements:
  * Jobs running in the background can now be removed from the list of jobs
    with the new disown builtin, which behaves like the same command in other
    shells (#2810).
  * Command substitutions now have access to the terminal, like in other
    shells. This allows tools like fzf to work properly (#1362, #3922).
  * In cases where the operating system does not report the size of the
    terminal, the COLUMNS and LINES environment variables are used; if they
    are unset, a default of 80x24 is assumed.
  * New French (#3772 & #3788) and improved German (#3834) translations.
  * fish no longer depends on the which external command.
  * Full changelog: https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/releases/tag/2.6.0

Fri Feb  3 04:13:49 UTC 2017 - sflees@suse.de

- Update to 2.5.0
  Notable fixes and improvements
  * alias, run without options or arguments, lists all defined aliases, and
    aliases now include a description in the function signature that identifies
    them.
  * complete accepts empty strings as descriptions (#3557).
  * command accepts -q/--quiet in combination with --search (#3591), providing
    a simple way of checking whether a command exists in scripts.
  * Abbreviations can now be renamed with abbr --rename OLD_KEY NEW_KEY (#3610).
  * The command synopses printed by --help options work better with copying and
    pasting (#2673).
  * help launches the browser specified by the $fish_help_browser variable if it
    is set (#3131).
  * History merging could lose items under certain circumstances and is now
    fixed (#3496).
  * The $status variable is now set to 123 when a syntactically invalid command
    is entered (#3616).
  * Exiting fish now signals all background processes to terminate, not just
    stopped jobs (#3497).
  * A new prompt_hostname function which prints a hostname suitable for use in
    prompts (#3482).
  * The __fish_man_page function (bound to Alt-h by default) now tries to
    recognize subcommands (e.g. git add will now open the "git-add" man page)
    (#3678).
  * A new function edit_command_buffer (bound to Alt-e & Alt-v by default) to
    edit the command buffer in an external editor (#1215, #3627).
  * set_color now supports italics (--italics), dim (--dim) and reverse
    (--reverse) modes (#3650).
  * Filesystems with very slow locking (eg incorrectly-configured NFS) will no
    longer slow fish down (#685).
  * Improved completions for apt (#3695), fusermount (#3642), make (#3628),
    netctl-auto (#3378), nmcli (#3648), pygmentize (#3378), and tar (#3719).
  * Added completions for:
        VBoxHeadless (#3378)
        VBoxSDL (#3378)
        base64 (#3378)
        caffeinate (#3524)

- Update to version 2.4.0
  ## Notable fixes and improvements
  * The documentation is now generated properly and with the
    correct version identifier.
  * Automatic cursor changes are now only enabled on the
    subset of XTerm versions known to support them, resolving a
    problem where older versions printed garbage to the terminal
    before and after every prompt (#3499).
  * Improved the title set in Apple Terminal.app.
  * Added completions for `defaults` and improved completions
    for `diskutil` (#3478).
  # fish 2.4b1 (released October 18, 2016)
  ## Significant changes
  * The clipboard integration has been revamped with explicit
    bindings. The killring commands no longer copy from, or
    paste to, the X11 clipboard - use the new copy (`C-x`) and
    paste (`C-v`) bindings instead. The clipboard is now
    available on OS X as well as systems using X11 (e.g. Linux).
    (#3061)
  * `history` uses subcommands (`history delete`) rather than
    options (`history --delete`) for its actions (#3367). You
    can no longer specify multiple actions via flags (e.g.,
    `history --delete --save something`).
  * New `history` options have been added, including `--max=n`
    to limit the number of history entries, `--show-time` option
    to show timestamps (#3175, #3244), and `--null` to null
    terminate history entries in the search output.
  * `history search` is now case-insensitive by default (which
    also affects `history delete`) (#3236).
  * `history delete` now correctly handles multiline commands
    (#31).
  * Vi-style bindings no longer include all of the default
    emacs-style bindings; instead, they share some definitions
    (#3068).
  * If there is no locale set in the environment, various
    known system configuration files will be checked for a
    default. If no locale can be found, `en_US-UTF.8` will be
    used (#277).
  * A number followed by a caret (e.g. `5^`) is no longer
    treated as a redirection (#1873).
  * The `$version` special variable can be overwritten, so
    that it can be used for other purposes if required.
  ## Notable fixes and improvements
  * The `fish_realpath` builtin has been renamed to `realpath`
    and made compatible with GNU `realpath` when run without
    arguments (#3400). It is used only for systems without a
    `realpath` or `grealpath` utility (#3374).
  * Improved color handling on terminals/consoles with 8-16
    colors, particularly the use of bright named color (#3176,
    #3260).
  * `fish_indent` can now read from files given as arguments,
    rather than just standard input (#3037).
  * Fuzzy tab completions behave in a less surprising manner
    (#3090, #3211).
  * `jobs` should only print its header line once (#3127).
  * Wildcards in redirections are highlighted appropriately
    (#2789).
  * Suggestions will be offered more often, like after
    removing characters (#3069).
  * `history --merge` now correctly interleaves items in
    chronological order (#2312).
  * Options for `fish_indent` have been aligned with the other
    binaries - in particular, `-d` now means `--debug`. The
    `--dump` option has been renamed to `--dump-parse-tree`
    (#3191).
  * The display of bindings in the Web-based configuration has
    been greatly improved (#3325), as has the rendering of
    prompts (#2924).
  * fish should no longer hang using 100% CPU in the C locale
    (#3214).
  * A bug in FreeBSD 11 & 12, Dragonfly BSD & illumos
    prevented fish from working correctly on these platforms
    under UTF-8 locales; fish now avoids the buggy behaviour
    (#3050).
  * Prompts which show git repository information (via
    `__fish_git_prompt`) are faster in large repositories
    (#3294) and slow filesystems (#3083).
  * fish 2.3.0 reintroduced a problem where the greeting was
    printed even when using `read`; this has been corrected
    again (#3261).
  * Vi mode changes the cursor depending on the current mode
    (#3215).
  * Command lines with escaped space characters at the end
    tab-complete correctly (#2447).
  * Added completions for:
    + `arcanist` (#3256)
    + `connmanctl` (#3419)
    + `figlet` (#3378)
    + `mdbook` (#3378)
    +  `ninja` (#3415)
    +  `p4`, the Perforce client (#3314)
    +  `pygmentize` (#3378)
    +  `ranger` (#3378)
  * Improved completions for `aura` (#3297), `abbr` (#3267),
    `brew` (#3309), `chown` (#3380, #3383),`cygport` (#3392),
    `git` (#3274, #3226, #3225, #3094, #3087, #3035, #3021,
    #2982, #3230), `kill & `pkill` (#3200), `screen` (#3271),
    `wget` (#3470), and `xz` (#3378).
  * Distributors, packagers and developers will notice that
    the build process produces more succinct output by default;
    use `make V=1` to get verbose output (#3248).
  * Improved compatibility with minor platforms including musl
    (#2988), Cygwin (#2993), Android (#3441, #3442), Haiku
    (#3322) and Solaris .

  * Extra lines were sometimes inserted into the output under Windows (Cygwin
    and Microsoft Windows Subsystem for Linux) due to TTY timestamps
    not being updated (#2859).
  * The string builtin's match mode now handles the combination of -rnv (match,
    invert and count) correctly (#3098).
  * Improvements to TTY special character handling (#3064), locale handling (#3124)
    and terminal environment variable handling (#3060).
  * Work towards handling the terminal modes for external commands launched
    from initialisation files (#2980).
  * Ease the upgrade path from fish 2.2.0 and before by warning users to restart
    fish if the string builtin is not available (#3057).

   * The fish_vi_mode function is now deprecated in favour of
     fish_vi_key_bindings
- Backward-incompatible changes
   * Unmatched globs will now cause an error, except when used
     with for, set or count (#2719, #2394) and and or will now bind

  to protect requests and only responds to requests from the local
  machine with this token, preventing a remote code execution
  attack (closing CVE-2014-2914).

  allow local privilege escalation and data tampering (closing
  CVE-2014-2906 and CVE-2014-3856)
- fishd uses a secure path for its socket, preventing a local
  privilege escalation attack (closing CVE-2014-2905)
- __fish_print_packages is no longer vulnerable to attacks which
  would allow local privilege escalation and data tampering
  (closing CVE-2014-3219)
- fishd now ignores SIGPIPE, fixing crashes using tools like
  GNU Parallel and which occurred more often as a result of
  the other fishd changes.
