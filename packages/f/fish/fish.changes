- Add 8784-old-school-cmd-subst.patch fixing fish_title.fish

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 16 06:35:37 UTC 2022 - pgajdos@suse.com

- version update to 3.4.0

  * fish’s command substitution syntax has been extended: $(cmd) now
    has the same meaning as (cmd) but it can be used inside double
    quotes, to prevent line splitting of the results (#159)
  * Complementing the prompt command in 3.3.0, fish_config gained
    a theme subcommand to show and pick from the sample themes
    (meaning color schemes) directly in the terminal, instead of
    having to open a Web browser.
  * set and read learned a new option, --function, to set a variable
    in the function’s top scope. This should be a more familiar way
    of scoping variables and avoids issues with --local, which is
    actually block-scoped (#565, #8145)
  * string pad now excludes escape sequences like colors that fish
    knows about, and a new --visible flag to string length makes
    it use that kind of visible width. This is useful to get the
    number of terminal cells an already colored string would occupy,
    like in a prompt. (#8182, #7784, #4012)
  * Performance improvements to globbing, especially on systems
    using glibc. In some cases (large directories with files with
    many numbers in the names) this almost halves the time taken
    to expand the glob.
  * Autosuggestions can now be turned off by setting
    $fish_autosuggestion_enabled to 0, and (almost) all highlighting
    can be turned off by choosing the new “None” theme. The exception
    is necessary colors, like those which distinguish autosuggestions
    from the actual command line. (#8376)
  * The fish_git_prompt function, which is included in the default
    prompts, now overrides git to avoid running commands set by
    per-repository configuration. This avoids a potential security
    issue in some circumstances, and has been assigned CVE-2022-20001
    (#8589). [bsc#1197139]

Fri Feb 25 09:35:44 UTC 2022 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- We don't need to remove unnecessary completions (curl and pyenv
  in this case), the ones in /usr/share/fish/vendor_completions.d
  have precedence. Now just to make all other packages put theirs
  in the right location!

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 2 20:39:41 UTC 2021 - Victorhck <victorhck@opensuse.org>

- Update to 3.3.1:
  * The prompt and command line are redrawn correctly in response to universal variable changes.
  * A superfluous error that was produced when setting the PATH or CDPATH environment variables to include colon-delimited components that do not exist was removed.
  * The Vi mode indicator in the prompt is repainted correctly after Ctrl-C cancels the current command.
  
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Apr 18 22:39:41 UTC 2021 - Avindra Goolcharan <avindra@opensuse.org>

- Update to 3.2.2:
  * Background jobs no longer interfere with syntax highlighting (fish 3.2.1 regression)
  * The command-not-found handler used suggestions from pacman on Arch
    Linux, but this caused major slowdowns on some systems and has been disabled
  * Certain programs (such as lazygit) could create situations where
    fish would not receive keystrokes correctly, but it is now more
    robust in these situations
  * Completions for aura and tshark should no longer produce errors.
  * fish will no longer hang on exit if another process is in the foreground
    on macOS
  * Arguments longer than 1024 characters no longer trigger excessive
    CPU usage on macOS

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar 18 17:40:37 UTC 2021 - Avindra Goolcharan <avindra@opensuse.org>

-  Update to 3.2.1:
  * Commands in key bindings are run with fish's internal terminal
    modes, instead of the terminal modes typically used for commands.
    This fixes a bug introduced in 3.2.0, where text would unexpectedly
    appear on the terminal, especially when pasting
  * Prompts which use the internal __fish_print_pipestatus function will
    display correctly rather than carrying certain modifiers (such as
    bold) further than intended
  * Redirections to internal file descriptors is allowed again, reversing
    the changes in 3.2.0. This fixes a problem with Midnight Commander
  * Universal variables should be fully reliable regardless of operating
    system again
  * fish_git_prompt no longer causes screen flickering in certain terminals
  * fish_add_path manipulates the fish_user_paths variable correctly
    when moving multiple paths
  * Pasting with a multi-line command no longer causes 
     __fish_tokenizer_state error
  * psub inside event handlers cleans up temporary files properly
  * Event handlers declared with --on-job-exit $fish_pid no longer run
    constantly, although these functions should use --on-event fish_exit
    instead.
  * Changing terminal modes inside config.fish works
  * set_color --print-colors no longer prints all colors in bold
  * Completing commands starting with a - no longer prints an error
  * Running fish_command_not_found directly no longer produces an error
    on macOS or other OSes which do not have a handler available
  * The new type builtin now has the (deprecated) --quiet long form of -q
  * help and fish_config work correctly when fish is running in a Chrome
    OS Crostini Linux VM
  * The history file can be made a symbolic link without it being overwritten,
    matching a similar improvement for the universal variable file in 3.2.0.
  * An unhelpful error ("access: No error"), seen on Cygwin, is no longer produced
  * Improvements to the rsync completions, some completion descriptions,
    and completions that use IP address
  * Improvements to the appearance of fish_config
- explicitly list binaries in spec file

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar  9 05:43:01 UTC 2021 - Samu Voutilainen <smar@smar.fi>

- Define GenericName and proper category in fish.desktop 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar  1 15:43:22 UTC 2021 - Paolo Stivanin <info@paolostivanin.com>

- Update to 3.2.0:
  * Undo and redo support for the command-line editor and pager search
  * Builtins can now output before all data is read
  * Prompts will now be truncated instead of replaced with "> "
  * Better errors with "test"
  * A new theme for the documentation and Web-based configuration
  * fish --no-execute will no longer complain about unknown commands
    or non-matching wildcards
  * string match --regex now integrates named PCRE2 capture groups
    as fish variables
  * Globs and other expansions are limited to 512,288 results
  * A new "fish for bash users" documentation page gives a quick overview
    of the scripting differences between bash and fish 
  * Range limits in index range expansions like $x[$start..$end]
    may be omitted: $start and $end default to 1 and -1 
  * the type, _ (gettext), . (source) and : (no-op) functions
    are now implemented builtins for performance purposes
  * The output for set --show has been shortened
  * string sub has a new --end option to specify the end index of
    a substring 
  * string trim now also trims vertical tabs by default
  * string repeat now handles multiple arguments, repeating each one
  * The true and false builtins ignore any arguments
  * status gained new dirname and basename convenience subcommands
  * jobs now shows continued child processes correctly
  * A new fish_status_to_signal function for transforming exit statuses
    to signal names has been added
  * fish -c now reads the remaining arguments into $argv
  * The pwd command supports the long options --logical and --physical
  * https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/releases/tag/3.2.0
- Remove fix-pc-file-paths.patch
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb  8 00:14:35 UTC 2021 - Simon Lees <sflees@suse.de>

- pc file contained references to /usr/local (boo#1181888)
  * fix-pc-file-paths.patch - Already fixed upstream

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Aug  9 14:56:41 UTC 2020 - Sam Yu <ytz1995@hotmail.com>

- Fix empty output of fish builtin help

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 30 08:16:41 UTC 2020 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 3.1.2:
  * Commands such as fzf and enhancd, when used with eval, would
    hang. eval buffered output too aggressively, which has been
	fixed (#6955).
- Changes in 3.1.2:
  * Commands which involve . ( ... | psub) now work correctly, as
    a bug in the function --on-job-exit option has been fixed (#6613).
  * Conflicts between upstream packages for ripgrep and bat, and the
    fish packages, have been resolved (#5822).
  * Starting fish in a directory without read access, such as via
    su, no longer crashes (#6597).
  * Glob ordering changes which were introduced in 3.1.0 have been
    reverted, returning the order of globs to the previous state (#6593).
  * Redirections using the deprecated caret syntax to a file
    descriptor (eg ^&2) work correctly (#6591).
  * Redirections that append to a file descriptor (eg 2>>&1)
    work correctly (#6614).
  * Building fish on macOS (#6602) or with new versions of GCC
    (#6604, #6609) is now successful.
  * time is now correctly listed in the output of builtin -n,
    and time --help works correctly (#6598).
  * Exported universal variables now update properly (#6612).
  * status current-command gives the expected output when used
    with an environment override - that is, F=B status current-command
    returns status instead of F=B (#6635).
  * test no longer crashes when used with "nan" or "inf" arguments,
    erroring out instead (#6655).
  * Copying from the end of the command line no longer crashes
    fish (#6680).
  * read no longer removes multiple separators when splitting a
    variable into a list, restoring the previous behaviour from fish
    3.0 and before (#6650).
  * Functions using --on-job-exit and --on-process-exit work
    reliably again (#6679).
  * Functions using --on-signal INT work reliably in interactive
    sessions, as they did in fish 2.7 and before (#6649). These handlers
    have never worked in non-interactive sessions, and making them
    work is an ongoing process.
  * Functions using --on-variable work reliably with variables which
    are set implicitly (rather than with set), such as
    "fish_bind_mode" and "PWD" (#6653).
  * 256 colors are properly enabled under certain conditions that were
    incorrectly detected in fish 3.1.0 ($TERM begins with xterm, does
    not include "256color", and $TERM_PROGRAM is not set) (#6701).
  * The Mercurial (hg) prompt no longer produces an error when the
    current working directory is removed (#6699). Also, for performance
    reasons it shows only basic information by default; to restore the
    detailed status, set $fish_prompt_hg_show_informative_status.
  * The VCS prompt, fish_vcs_prompt, no longer displays Subversion (svn)
    status by default, due to the potential slowness of this operation (#6681).
  * Pasting of commands has been sped up (#6713).
  * Using extended Unicode characters, such as emoji, in a non-Unicode
    capable locale (such as the C or POSIX locale) no longer renders
    all output blank (#6736).
  * help prefers to use xdg-open, avoiding the use of open on Debian
    systems where this command is actually openvt (#6739).
  * Command lines starting with a space, which are not saved in history,
    now do not get autosuggestions. This fixes an issue with Midnight
    Commander integration (#6763), but may be changed in a future version.
  * Copying to the clipboard no longer inserts a newline at the end of the
    content, matching fish 2.7 and earlier (#6927).
  * fzf in complex pipes no longer hangs. More generally, code run as
    part of command substitutions or eval will no longer have separate
    process groups. (#6624, #6806).

* fish's debugging arguments have been significantly improved
* new builtin command, time, which allows timing of fish functions
  and builtins as well as external commands

  a variable expansion, meaning common commands such as
  git reset HEAD@{0} do not require escaping
* many other fixes and improvements

- Update to 2.7.0. Notable improvements:
  * A new cdh (change directory using recent history) command provides a more
    friendly alternative to prevd/nextd and pushd/popd (#2847).
  * A new argparse command is available to allow fish script to parse arguments
    with the same behavior as builtin commands. This also includes the fish_opt helper command. (#4190).
  * Invalid array indexes are now silently ignored (#826, #4127).
  * Improvements to the debugging facility, including a prompt specific to the
    debugger (fish_breakpoint_prompt) and a status is-breakpoint subcommand (#1310).
  * string supports new lower and upper subcommands, for altering the case of
    strings (#4080). The case changing is not locale-aware yet.
  * string escape has a new --style=xxx flag where xxx can be script, var,
    or url (#4150), and can be reversed with string unescape (#3543).
  * History can now be split into sessions with the fish_history variable,
    or not saved to disk at all (#102).
  * Read history is now controlled by the fish_history variable rather than
    the --mode-name flag (#1504).
  * command now supports an --all flag to report all directories with the
    command. which is no longer a runtime dependency (#2778).
  * fish can run commands before starting an interactive session using the new
    --init-command/-C options (#4164).
  * set has a new --show option to show lots of information about variables
    (#4265).

  * Command substitutions now have access to the terminal, like in other
    shells. This allows tools like fzf to work properly (#1362, #3922).
  * In cases where the operating system does not report the size of the
    terminal, the COLUMNS and LINES environment variables are used; if they
    are unset, a default of 80x24 is assumed.
  * New French (#3772 & #3788) and improved German (#3834) translations.
  * fish no longer depends on the which external command.

Fri Feb  3 04:13:49 UTC 2017 - sflees@suse.de

- Update to 2.5.0
  Notable fixes and improvements
  * alias, run without options or arguments, lists all defined aliases, and
    aliases now include a description in the function signature that identifies
    them.
  * complete accepts empty strings as descriptions (#3557).
  * command accepts -q/--quiet in combination with --search (#3591), providing
    a simple way of checking whether a command exists in scripts.
  * Abbreviations can now be renamed with abbr --rename OLD_KEY NEW_KEY (#3610).
  * The command synopses printed by --help options work better with copying and
    pasting (#2673).
  * help launches the browser specified by the $fish_help_browser variable if it
    is set (#3131).
  * History merging could lose items under certain circumstances and is now
    fixed (#3496).
  * The $status variable is now set to 123 when a syntactically invalid command
    is entered (#3616).
  * Exiting fish now signals all background processes to terminate, not just
    stopped jobs (#3497).
  * A new prompt_hostname function which prints a hostname suitable for use in
    prompts (#3482).
  * The __fish_man_page function (bound to Alt-h by default) now tries to
    recognize subcommands (e.g. git add will now open the "git-add" man page)
    (#3678).
  * A new function edit_command_buffer (bound to Alt-e & Alt-v by default) to
    edit the command buffer in an external editor (#1215, #3627).
  * set_color now supports italics (--italics), dim (--dim) and reverse
    (--reverse) modes (#3650).
  * Filesystems with very slow locking (eg incorrectly-configured NFS) will no
    longer slow fish down (#685).
  * Improved completions for apt (#3695), fusermount (#3642), make (#3628),
    netctl-auto (#3378), nmcli (#3648), pygmentize (#3378), and tar (#3719).

- Update to version 2.4.0
  ## Notable fixes and improvements
  * The documentation is now generated properly and with the
    correct version identifier.
  * Automatic cursor changes are now only enabled on the
    subset of XTerm versions known to support them, resolving a
    problem where older versions printed garbage to the terminal
    before and after every prompt (#3499).
  * Improved the title set in Apple Terminal.app.
  * Added completions for `defaults` and improved completions
    for `diskutil` (#3478).
  # fish 2.4b1 (released October 18, 2016)
  ## Significant changes
  * The clipboard integration has been revamped with explicit
    bindings. The killring commands no longer copy from, or
    paste to, the X11 clipboard - use the new copy (`C-x`) and
    paste (`C-v`) bindings instead. The clipboard is now
    available on OS X as well as systems using X11 (e.g. Linux).
    (#3061)
  * `history` uses subcommands (`history delete`) rather than
    options (`history --delete`) for its actions (#3367). You
    can no longer specify multiple actions via flags (e.g.,
    `history --delete --save something`).
  * New `history` options have been added, including `--max=n`
    to limit the number of history entries, `--show-time` option
    to show timestamps (#3175, #3244), and `--null` to null
    terminate history entries in the search output.
  * `history search` is now case-insensitive by default (which
    also affects `history delete`) (#3236).
  * `history delete` now correctly handles multiline commands
    (#31).
  * Vi-style bindings no longer include all of the default
    emacs-style bindings; instead, they share some definitions
    (#3068).
  * If there is no locale set in the environment, various
    known system configuration files will be checked for a
    default. If no locale can be found, `en_US-UTF.8` will be
    used (#277).
  * A number followed by a caret (e.g. `5^`) is no longer
    treated as a redirection (#1873).
  * The `$version` special variable can be overwritten, so
    that it can be used for other purposes if required.
  ## Notable fixes and improvements
  * The `fish_realpath` builtin has been renamed to `realpath`
    and made compatible with GNU `realpath` when run without
    arguments (#3400). It is used only for systems without a
    `realpath` or `grealpath` utility (#3374).
  * Improved color handling on terminals/consoles with 8-16
    colors, particularly the use of bright named color (#3176,
    #3260).
  * `fish_indent` can now read from files given as arguments,
    rather than just standard input (#3037).
  * Fuzzy tab completions behave in a less surprising manner
    (#3090, #3211).
  * `jobs` should only print its header line once (#3127).
  * Wildcards in redirections are highlighted appropriately
    (#2789).
  * Suggestions will be offered more often, like after
    removing characters (#3069).
  * `history --merge` now correctly interleaves items in
    chronological order (#2312).
  * Options for `fish_indent` have been aligned with the other
    binaries - in particular, `-d` now means `--debug`. The
    `--dump` option has been renamed to `--dump-parse-tree`
    (#3191).
  * The display of bindings in the Web-based configuration has
    been greatly improved (#3325), as has the rendering of
    prompts (#2924).
  * fish should no longer hang using 100% CPU in the C locale
    (#3214).
  * A bug in FreeBSD 11 & 12, Dragonfly BSD & illumos
    prevented fish from working correctly on these platforms
    under UTF-8 locales; fish now avoids the buggy behaviour
    (#3050).
  * Prompts which show git repository information (via
    `__fish_git_prompt`) are faster in large repositories
    (#3294) and slow filesystems (#3083).
  * fish 2.3.0 reintroduced a problem where the greeting was
    printed even when using `read`; this has been corrected
    again (#3261).
  * Vi mode changes the cursor depending on the current mode
    (#3215).
  * Command lines with escaped space characters at the end
    tab-complete correctly (#2447).
  * Added completions for:
    + `arcanist` (#3256)

- Update to v2.3.1
- Significant changes
  * A new fish_key_reader binary for decoding interactive keypresses (#2991).
  * fish_mode_prompt has been updated to reflect the changes in the way the
    Vi input mode is set up (#3067), making this more reliable.
  * fish_config can now properly be launched from the OS X app bundle (#3140).

- Notable fixes and improvements
  * Extra lines were sometimes inserted into the output under Windows (Cygwin
    and Microsoft Windows Subsystem for Linux) due to TTY timestamps
    not being updated (#2859).
  * The string builtin's match mode now handles the combination of -rnv (match,
    invert and count) correctly (#3098).
  * Improvements to TTY special character handling (#3064), locale handling (#3124)
    and terminal environment variable handling (#3060).
  * Work towards handling the terminal modes for external commands launched
    from initialisation files (#2980).
  * Ease the upgrade path from fish 2.2.0 and before by warning users to restart
    fish if the string builtin is not available (#3057).
  * type -a now syntax-colorizes function source output.
  * Added completions for alsamixer, godoc, gofmt, goimports, gorename, lscpu,
    mkdir, modinfo, netctl-auto, poweroff, termite, udisksctl and xz (#3123).
  * Improved completions for apt (#3097), aura (#3102),git (#3114), npm (#3158),
    string and suspend (#3154).

Mon May 23 01:05:17 UTC 2016 - sflees@suse.de

- Update to v2.3.0
- Significant Changes
   * A new string builtin to handle… strings!
   * After seeing an escape character wait up to 300ms for an a
     dditional character.
   * Add new directories for vendor functions and configuration
     snippets (#2498)
   * A new fish_realpath builtin and associated function to allow
     the use of realpath even on those platforms that don't ship
     an appropriate command. (#2932)
   * Alt-# toggles the current command line between commented and
     uncommented states, making it easy to save a command in
     history without executing it.
   * The fish_vi_mode function is now deprecated in favour of
     fish_vi_key_bindings
- Backward-incompatible changes
   * Unmatched globs will now cause an error, except when used
     with for, set or count (#2719, #2394) and and or will now bind
     to the closest if or while, allowing compound conditions without
     begin and end (#1428)
   * set -ql now searches up to function scope for variables (#2502)
   * status -f will now behave the same when run as the main script
     or using source (#2643)
   * source no longer puts the file name in $argv if no arguments
     are given (#139)

- update to 2.1.1
- The fish_config web interface now uses an authentication token
  to protect requests and only responds to requests from the local
  machine with this token, preventing a remote code execution
  attack (closing CVE-2014-2914).
- psub and funced are no longer vulnerable to attacks which
  allow local privilege escalation and data tampering (closing
  CVE-2014-2906 and CVE-2014-3856)
- fishd uses a secure path for its socket, preventing a local
  privilege escalation attack (closing CVE-2014-2905)
- __fish_print_packages is no longer vulnerable to attacks which
  would allow local privilege escalation and data tampering
  (closing CVE-2014-3219)
- fishd now ignores SIGPIPE, fixing crashes using tools like
  GNU Parallel and which occurred more often as a result of
  the other fishd changes.
