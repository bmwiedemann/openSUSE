Wed Aug 27 15:33:09 UTC 2025 - Soc Virnyl Estela <uncomfyhalomacro@opensuse.org>

- Update to 1.13.1:
  * Regression: input not being returned in dmenu mode.
  * Regression: `--password` not working.
  * Regression: Part of the background transparency disappearing after
    typing.
  * Add support for fallback icons in dmenu mode using comma-separated
  values in the icon metadata.
  * `--namespace` command line option.
  * Gamma-correct blending. Disabled by default. Enable with the new
  `--gamma-correct` command line option, or by setting
  `gamma-correct-blending=yes` in `fuzzel.ini`. Note that
  gamma-correct blending **is not supported in cairo enabled builds of
  fuzzel**, due to the lack of 16-bit image buffers in cairo.
  * `scaling-filter` option (and the corresponding `--scaling-filter`
  command line option). This option defines which scaling filter
  fuzzel uses when down scaling PNGs.
  * `--minimal-lines` command line and config option, causing fuzzel to
  adjust the number of displayed lines to the minimum of `--lines` and
  the number of input lines
  * Touchscreen support
  * `{cmd}` placeholder support in the `terminal` option. When `{cmd}` is
  present in the terminal command string, it will be replaced with the
  application command instead of appending the command at the end. Useful
  for setting the title or app_id.
  * `--hide-prompt` command line option to hide the prompt line, reducing
   window size while still accepting input. This cannot be used
  simultaneously with `--prompt-only`.
  * `--auto-select` option. When one entry is left, automatically select
  it.
  * `selection-radius` option and `--selection-radius` flag to set the border
  radius of the selected entry
  * `enable-mouse` option and `--no-mouse` flag to disable mouse input1
  * Crash when --match-workers >= 100. 
  * Keyboard modifiers not being reset on keyboard leave events. 
  * --with-nth: non-selected columns still being matched. 
  * Match highlighting being offset when --with-nth is used. 
  * Too wide PNGs bleeding into the text. 
  * Lookup of icon themes in ~/.icons and /usr/share/pixmans. 
  * Missing shell completions for --launch-prefix. 
  * Missing shell completions for --prompt-only. 
  * Empty window being displayed despite --no-run-if-empty being used. 
  * Fix border width and scaling for mixed-DPI environments 
  * Some icons not found on FreeBSD (/usr/local/share/pixmaps not searched) 
  * Segfault when “execute” action is pressed before there’s any item in the list.
  * Scrolling speed is now line-by-line instead of page-by-page 
  * Number of render workers is now automatically limited to the number of displayed entries. 
  * wayland-protocols >= 1.41 is now required. 
  * pixman >= 0.46.0 is now required. 
  * fcft >= 3.3.1 is now required. 
  * In application mode (not dmenu), fuzzel now ignores icon theme directories whose Context field is not Application or Apps, or Legacy. This is for performance reasons 
  * Default down scaling filter changed from lanczos3 to box. 
  * Use the width of ‘o’ instead of ‘W’ when calculating the window width. 
  * Default icon theme from hicolor to default. 
  * Error out (with an appropriate error message) if the command line we attempt to execute has non-specification-compliant quoting. 
  * Input text now “scrolls” with the cursor, if the string is longer than the available space. 
  * When using the mouse, the currently selected item is only changed when the mouse is over an item. Before this release, the X coordinate was ignored.

Fri Jun 27 20:37:51 UTC 2025 - Alessio Biancalana <dottorblaster@opensuse.org>

- Update to 1.12.0:
  - Added:
    * Add support for fallback icons in dmenu mode using comma-separated
      values in the icon metadata ([#504][504]).
    * `--namespace` command line option ([#512][512]).
    * Gamma-correct blending. Disabled by default. Enable with the new
      `--gamma-correct` command line option, or by setting
      `gamma-correct-blending=yes` in `fuzzel.ini`. Note that
      gamma-correct blending **is not supported in cairo enabled builds of
      fuzzel**, due to the lack of 16-bit image buffers in cairo
      ([#546][546]).
    * `scaling-filter` option (and the corresponding `--scaling-filter`
      command line option). This option defines which scaling filter
      fuzzel uses when down scaling PNGs ([#553][553]).
    * `--minimal-lines` command line and config option, causing fuzzel to
      adjust the number of displayed lines to the minimum of `--lines` and
      the number of input lines ([#144][144])
    * Touchscreen support ([#594][594])
    * `{cmd}` placeholder support in the `terminal` option. When `{cmd}` is
      present in the terminal command string, it will be replaced with the
      application command instead of appending the command at the end. Useful
      for setting the title or app_id. ([#600][600])
  - Changed:
    * Scrolling speed is now line-by-line instead of page-by-page ([#586][586])
    * Number of render workers is now automatically limited to the number
      of displayed entries.
    * wayland-protocols >= 1.41 is now required.
    * pixman >= 0.46.0 is now required.
    * fcft >= 3.3.1 is now required.
    * In application mode (not dmenu), fuzzel now ignores icon theme
      directories whose `Context` field is not `Application` or
      `Apps`. This is for performance reasons ([#553][553])
    * Default down scaling filter changed from `lanczos3` to `box`
      ([#553][553]).
    * Use the width of 'o' instead of 'W' when calculating the window
      width ([#560][560]).
    * Default icon theme from `hicolor` to `default`.
    * Error out (with an appropriate error message) if the command line we
      attempt to execute has non-specification-compliant quoting.
  - Fixed:
    * Crash when `--match-workers >= 100` ([#507][507]).
    * Keyboard modifiers not being reset on keyboard leave events.
    * `--with-nth`: non-selected columns still being matched.
    * Match highlighting being offset when `--with-nth` is used
      ([#551][551]).
    * Too wide PNGs bleeding into the text ([#313][313]).
    * Lookup of icon themes in `~/.icons` and `/usr/share/pixmans`.
    * Missing shell completions for `--launch-prefix`.
    * Missing shell completions for `--prompt-only`.
    * Empty window being displayed despite `--no-run-if-empty` being used.
    * Fix border width and scaling for mixed-DPI environments ([#595][595])

Tue Sep 24 10:53:11 UTC 2024 - Soc Virnyl Estela <obs@uncomfyhalomacro.pl>

- Completion packages require main package

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep 13 10:08:10 UTC 2024 - llyyr <llyyr@yukari.in>

- Update to 1.11.1:
  - Added:
    * New option --hide-before-typing for application launcher mode
      hides the list until the first character is typed
  - Changed:
    * Logging no longer reports "aborted" if dmenu mode is called with
      no input
  - Fixed:
    * Crash when the border size is larger than the border radius
    * Regression: cursor not centered when using a custom line height
    * Regression: selected background not rendered on top of the
      regular background
    * Regression: Supporting XDG_CONFIG_HOME as absolute path but not
      relative should be supported

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep  9 07:24:33 UTC 2024 - llyyr <llyyr@yukari.in>

- Update to 1.11.0:
  - Added:
    * Nanosvg updated to 93ce879dc4c04a3ef1758428ec80083c38610b1f
    * New options `--x-margin` `--y-margin` which place the launcher some
      distance away from the anchor point, in pixels. Default to 0
      ([#344][344]).
    * Support for the `StartupNotify` key in `.desktop` files.
    * Log output now respects the [`NO_COLOR`](http://no-color.org/)
      environment variable.
    * Rounded corners without cairo. With this, the **only** time cairo is
      needed is when you want to use the librsvg SVG backend. For nanosvg
      builds, there is no longer any need to link against cairo.
    * Support for linking against a system provided nanosvg library. See
      the new `-Dsystem-nanosvg` meson option. Default's to `disabled`
      (i.e. use the bundled version).
    * Mouse support. Left click selects/launches, right click quits
      fuzzel, wheel scrolls (a page at at time). This is, for the time
      being, not configurable ([#131][131])
    * `--cache=PATH` command line option, and `cache` option to
      `fuzzel.ini`, allowing a custom cache location to be used
      ([#189][189], [#219][219]).
    * `expunge` key binding, to remove an entry from the cache. Mapped to
      shift+delete by default.
    * `--prompt-color` and `colors.prompt`, controlling the
      text/foreground color of the prompt ([#365][365]).
    * `--input-color` and `colors.input`, controlling the text/foreground
      color of the input string ([#365][365]).
    * Much improved performance with large amounts of input ([#305][305]).
    * Improved rendering performance, by using threads. See the new
      `--render-workers` command line option, and the new `render-workers`
      option in `fuzzel.ini`.
    * dmenu mode: `--prompt-only=PROMPT` command line option
      ([#276][276]).
    * dmenu mode: start rendering input before STDIN has been closed.
    * `--match-workers` command line option and the new `match-workers`
      option in `fuzzel.ini`.
    * `delayed-filter-ms`, `delayed-filter-limit` options to `fuzzel.ini`,
      and `--delayed-filter-ms` and `--delayed-filter-limit` command line
      options.
    * Match count can now printed at the right-hand side of the input
      prompt. It is disabled by default, and can be enabled with either
      the `--counter` command line option, or the `match-counter` setting
      in `fuzzel.ini`.
    * `--counter-color` and `colors.counter`, controlling the color of the
      match count. The default value is `93a1a1ff` (_base1_ in the
      solarized palette).
    * The currently selected entry may now be rendered with a bold
      font. It is disabled by default, and can be enabled either via the
      new `--use-bold` command line option, or by setting `use-bold=yes`,
      in `fuzzel.ini`.
    * `sort-result` option to `fuzzel.ini`, and `--no-sort` command line
      option.
    * Placeholder text (for the input box), controlled by the new
      `--placeholder`, `--placeholder-color` command line options, and the
      `placeholder` and `colors.placeholder` options in `fuzzel.ini`
      ([#188][188]).
    * `--search=TEXT` command line option, allowing you to "pre-filter"
      the result ([#][274][274]).
    * Support for pasting text into fuzzel. Both the regular clipboard,
      and the primary clipboard are supported. See the new
      `clipboard-paste` and `primary-paste` key bindings ([#200][200]).
  - Changed:
    * The cache now stores desktop file **IDs** instead of the application
      titles. This way, we do not store multiple cache entries with the
      same value (title) ([#339][339]).
    * Always fallback on the icon theme `hicolor`.
    * Quitting without executing an entry in dmenu mode now exits with
      code 2 instead of 1 ([#353][353]).
    * The default `layer` is now `overlay` instead of `top`. This means
      fuzzel now renders on top of fullscreen windows by default
      ([#81][81]).
    * `--no-fuzzy` option has been replaced with `--match-mode`.
      Default match mode is `fzf`. Other options are `fuzzy` and `exact`. See
      `man fuzzel.ini` for details.
      ([#305][305]).
    * Default text color of the prompt and the selected entry to
      `586e75ff` (_base01_ in the solarized palette).
    * Initial application sorting is now done case insensitive.
    * Background is no longer transparent by default. You can change this
      by setting `colors.background`.
    * Search string is now font shaped, improving support for e.g Arabic
      ([#398][398]).
  - Fixed:
    * PNG images being way too dark.
    * Crash when the cache contains strings that are not valid in the
      current locale ([#337][337]).
    * Crash when `tabs` (in `fuzzel.ini`) is set to `0` ([#348][348]).
    * Crash while loading the cache, when `--list-executables-in-path` is
      used ([#356][356])
    * Rounding of window size when fractional scaling is used.
    * Dmenu mode failing with _"failed to read from stdin: Resource
      temporarily unavailable"_.
    * First frame flickers when fractional scaling is used.
    * Borders, padding etc not updated on scale changes when
      `dpi-aware=yes`. This mostly affected setups using fractional
      scaling, but all setups were affected in one way or another.
    * Mouse selection not working correctly (wrong item selected) when
      `dpi-aware=yes` and desktop scaling was enabled.

- Update to version 1.9.0:
  - Added:
    * Add support for startup notifications via xdg activation.
    * Convert tabs to spaces when rendering.
    * --dmenu0 command line option. Like --dmenu, but input is NUL separated instead of newline separated.
    * Support for localized strings. If you want the old behavior, run fuzzel with LC_MESSAGES=C.

    * When determining initial font size, do FontConfig config substitution if the user-provided font pattern has no {pixel}size option.
  - Fixed:
    * Update nanosvg to f0a3e10. Fixes rendering of certain SVG icons.
    * Not being able to input numbers using the keypad.
    * Absolute path PNG icons not being loaded.

    * Unsupported icon formats not being skipped when loading application icons.
    * Wrong size of PNG icons selected (#182)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct 28 12:11:39 UTC 2022 - Soc Virnyl Estela <socvirnyl.estela@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.8.1:
  - Fixed:
    * Regression: not able to input text with modifiers (e.g. Shift) pressed (#177).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct 25 22:22:00 UTC 2022 - Soc Virnyl Estela <socvirnyl.estela@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.8.0:
  - Added:
    * Support for file based configuration.
    * Customizable key bindings.
    * "Custom" key bindings (like Rofi’s `kb-custom-N` key
      bindings).
    * If `argv[0]` is _dmenu_, fuzzel now starts in dmenu mode.
    * `--password=[CHARACTER]` command line option. Intended to be used
      with “password input”; all typed text is rendered as _CHARACTER_,
      defaulting to `*` if _CHARACTER_ is omitted.
    * `Ctrl+y` binding to execute selected entry.
    * `Ctrl+j`/`Ctrl+k` binding to move to the next/previous item.
    * Escape sequences in `Exec` arguments are now supported.
    * Quoted environment variables in `Exec` arguments are now supported.
    * Multiple space-separated search words can now be entered at the prompt.
    * `-M,--selection-match-color`, that lets you configure the color of
      matched substrings of the currently selected item
    * New config option `image-size-ratio`, allowing you to control the
      size of the large image displayed when there are only a “few”
      matches.
    * Support for icons in dmenu mode, using Rofi’s extended dmenu
      protocol.
    * `--layer` command line option, allowing you to choose which layer to
      render the fuzzel window on (`top` or `overlay`).
    * `--no-exit-on-keyboard-focus-loss` command line option
      (`exit-on-keyboard-focus-loss` config option).
  
  - Changed:
    * `-i` is now **ignored**. This is to increase compatibility with
      other similar utilities. To set the icon theme, either use the long
      option (`--icon-theme=THEME`), or set it in the configuration file
      (default: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/fuzzel/fuzzel.ini`).
    * Minimum required meson version is now 0.58.
    * libpng warnings are now routed through fuzzel’s logging
      ([#101][101]).
    * Nanosvg is now the default SVG backend. librsvg is still supported,
      and can be used by setting the `-Dsvg-backend=librsvg` meson option.
    * It is no longer necessary to close stdin when using fuzzel in dmenu
      mode, as long as `--no-run-if-empty` is **not** being used.
    * Improved performance of initial rendering of icons.
    * `--terminal` now defaults to `$TERMINAL -e`.
    * Font shaping is now applied to the prompt
    * The large image displayed when there are only a “few” matches is now
      smaller by default.
    * Swapped meaning of the command line options `-p` and `-P`; `-p` is
      now the short option for `--prompt`.
    * Do not add icon-sized padding on the left size in dmenu mode.
    * Color config values are now allowed to be prefixed with `#`.
  
  - Fixed:
    * User `.desktop` entries with `NoDisplay=true` not overriding system
      entries.
    * Icon lookup is now better at following the XDG specification.
    * Backspace removes not only the previous character, but also
      everything **after** the cursor.
    * Crash on exit in dmenu mode when selection list is empty.
    * Keypad `enter` not executing the selected entry
  
- Fix build for meson having issue with c18 standard in spec by
  setting it to none. C18 standard is already supported in
  meson long before version 0.58.
