    <version>1.8.0</version>

    <comment>- Update to version 1.8.0:
  - Added:
    * Support for file based configuration.
    * Customizable key bindings.
    * &quot;Custom&quot; key bindings (like Rofi’s `kb-custom-N` key
      bindings).
    * If `argv[0]` is _dmenu_, fuzzel now starts in dmenu mode.
    * `--password=[CHARACTER]` command line option. Intended to be used
      with “password input”; all typed text is rendered as _CHARACTER_,
      defaulting to `*` if _CHARACTER_ is omitted.
    * `Ctrl+y` binding to execute selected entry.
    * `Ctrl+j`/`Ctrl+k` binding to move to the next/previous item.
    * Escape sequences in `Exec` arguments are now supported.
    * Quoted environment variables in `Exec` arguments are now supported.
    * Multiple space-separated search words can now be entered at the prompt.
    * `-M,--selection-match-color`, that lets you configure the color of
      matched substrings of the currently selected item
    * New config option `image-size-ratio`, allowing you to control the
      size of the large image displayed when there are only a “few”
      matches.
    * Support for icons in dmenu mode, using Rofi’s extended dmenu
      protocol.
    * `--layer` command line option, allowing you to choose which layer to
      render the fuzzel window on (`top` or `overlay`).
    * `--no-exit-on-keyboard-focus-loss` command line option
      (`exit-on-keyboard-focus-loss` config option).
  
  - Changed:
    * `-i` is now **ignored**. This is to increase compatibility with
      other similar utilities. To set the icon theme, either use the long
      option (`--icon-theme=THEME`), or set it in the configuration file
      (default: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/fuzzel/fuzzel.ini`).
    * Minimum required meson version is now 0.58.
    * libpng warnings are now routed through fuzzel’s logging
      ([#101][101]).
    * Nanosvg is now the default SVG backend. librsvg is still supported,
      and can be used by setting the `-Dsvg-backend=librsvg` meson option.
    * It is no longer necessary to close stdin when using fuzzel in dmenu
      mode, as long as `--no-run-if-empty` is **not** being used.
    * Improved performance of initial rendering of icons.
    * `--terminal` now defaults to `$TERMINAL -e`.
    * Font shaping is now applied to the prompt
    * The large image displayed when there are only a “few” matches is now
      smaller by default.
    * Swapped meaning of the command line options `-p` and `-P`; `-p` is
      now the short option for `--prompt`.
    * Do not add icon-sized padding on the left size in dmenu mode.
    * Color config values are now allowed to be prefixed with `#`.
  
  - Fixed:
    * User `.desktop` entries with `NoDisplay=true` not overriding system
      entries.
    * Icon lookup is now better at following the XDG specification.
    * Backspace removes not only the previous character, but also
      everything **after** the cursor.
    * Crash on exit in dmenu mode when selection list is empty.
    * Keypad `enter` not executing the selected entry
  
- Fix build for meson having issue with c18 standard in spec by
  setting it to none. C18 standard is already supported in
  meson long before version 0.58.
