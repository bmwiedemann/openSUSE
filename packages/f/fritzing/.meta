  <title>Intuitive EDA platform featuring from prototype to product</title>
  <description>Fritzing is an open-source initiative to support designers, artists,
researchers and hobbyists to take the step from physical prototyping
to actual product. It is in the spirit of Processing and Arduino which
allows users to document their Arduino and other electronic-based
prototypes, and to create a PCB layout for manufacturing.
