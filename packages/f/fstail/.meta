  <title>Scan a directory for changed files and tail them</title>
  <description>What's this for?

When you need to see the output from all changed files within a directory.

Why doesn't tail -f /var/logs/* work?

Unfortunately, tail -f /logs/* may not do what you want it to do. Bash will expand * to all existing files within /logs/ and then show the extra lines added to each of them.

It also will not recurse down, any levels deeper than the current directory.

How is fstail different then?

fstail uses the gopkg.in/fsnotify to detect both new files, and existing files that are changed. It then starts concatenting their contents to the terminal.

I needed this for actuated.dev which launches microVMs on servers for CI.

Each VM launched will create a different file at: /var/log/actuated/GUID.txt, and tail -f * would only find existing files.</description>
