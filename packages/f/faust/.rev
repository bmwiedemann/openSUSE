    <comment>Faust AUdio STreams is a functional programming language for real-time audio signal processing. Its programming model combines two approaches : functional programming and block diagram composition. You can think of FAUST as a structured block diagram language with a textual syntax.

FAUST is intended for developers who need to develop efficient C/C++ audio plugins for existing systems or full standalone audio applications. Thanks to some specific compilation techniques and powerful optimizations, the C++ code generated by the Faust compiler is usually very fast. It can generally compete with (and sometimes outperform) hand-written C code.

I updated it to the latest version which fixes the build issues :)</comment>
