- update to 0.3.4:
  - fscrypt now requires Go 1.16 or later to build.
  - pam_fscrypt now supports the option unlock_only to disable
    locking of directories on logout.
  - Fixed a bug where the number of CPUs used in the passphrase
    hash would be calculated incorrectly on systems with more than
    255 CPUs.
  - Added support for AES-256-HCTR2 filenames encryption.
  - Directories are now synced immediately after an encryption
    policy is applied, reducing the chance of an inconsistency
    after a sudden crash.
  - Added Lustre to the list of allowed filesystems.
  - Added a NEWS.md file that contains the release notes, and
    backfilled it from the GitHub release notes.

- update to 0.3.3:
  * Correctly handle malicious mountpoint paths in the fscrypt bash completion
    script (CVE-2022-25328, command injection).  
  * Validate the size, type, and owner (for login protectors) of policy and
    protector files (CVE-2022-25327, denial of service).
  * Make the fscrypt metadata directories non-world-writable by default
    (CVE-2022-25326, denial of service).
  * When running as a non-root user, ignore policy and protector files that
    aren't owned by the user or by root.
  * Also require that the metadata directories themselves and the mountpoint
    root directory be owned by the user or by root.
  * Make policy and protector files mode 0600 rather than 0644.
  * Make all relevant files owned by the user when root encrypts a directory
    with a user's login protector, not just the the login protector itself.
  * Make pam_fscrypt ignore system users completely.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb 10 20:16:40 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 0.3.2:
  * Made linked protectors (e.g., login protectors used on a non-root filesystem)
    more reliable when a filesystem UUID changes.
  * Made login protectors be owned by the user when they are created as root, so
    that the user has permission to update them later.
  * Made fscrypt work when the root directory is a btrfs filesystem.
  * Made pam_fscrypt start warning when a user's login protector is getting
    de-synced due to their password being changed by root.
  * Support reading the key for raw key protectors from standard input.
  * Made fscrypt metadata remove-protector-from-policy work even if the protector
    is no longer accessible.
  * Made fscrypt stop trying to access irrelevant filesystems.
  * Improved the documentation.
