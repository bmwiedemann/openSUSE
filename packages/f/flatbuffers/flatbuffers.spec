# Fixup CMake/FlatbuffersConfigVersion.cmake.in - Upstream releases tarballs
# that make no sense. They exect git describe to find correct information about
# the version in use - and replace that into the cmake file in the end. Obviously
# the tarball has no .git directory and thus does not carry that inormation
# We just inject %%version there. Easiest fix.
