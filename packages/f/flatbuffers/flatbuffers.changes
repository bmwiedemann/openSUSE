- update to 23.3.3:
  * Major release! Just kidding, we are continuing the versioning
    scheme of using a date to signify releases. This results in the
    first release of the new year to
    bump the tradition major version field.
  * Refactoring of flatc generators to use an interface (#7797).
  * Removed legacy cmake support and set min to 3.8 (#7801).
  * Reworked entry points for Typescript/Javascript and compatibility
    for single file build (#7510)
  * Removed go.mod files after some versioning issues were being
    report (#7780).
  * Go minimum version is now 1.19 (#7720) with the addition of Go
    modules.
  * Added CI support for Big Endian regression testing (#7707).
  * Fixed getFullyQualifiedName in typescript to return name
    delimited by '.' instead of '_' (#7730).
  * Fixed the versioning scheme to not include leading zeros which
    are not consistently handled by every package manager. Only the
    last release (12.12.06)
    should have suffered from this.
  * 20 Major releases in a row? Nope, we switched to a new versioning
    scheme that is based on date.
  * Python supports fixed size arrays now (#7529).
  * Behavior change in how C++ object API uses UnPackTo. The original
    intent of this was to reduce allocations by reusing an existing
    object to pack data into.
    At some point, this logic started to merge the states of the two
    objects instead of clearing the state of the packee. This change
    goes back to the original intention, the packed object is cleared
    when getting data packed into it (#7527).
  * Fixed a bug in C++ alignment that was using sizeof() instead of
    the intended AlignOf() for structs (#7520).

Fri Feb 14 12:01:50 UTC 2020 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Fix build: RPM 4.15 got a bit stricter and fails on
  find-provides script errors. Earlier RPM versions ignored it. In
  this specic case it turns out that the .cmake file installed is
  invalid, as it contained set(PACKAGE_VERSION "..") (so RPM is
  right to abort). Turns out that upstream simply did not really
  cater for the fact that this could be installed from tarball and
  not from a git checkout: they use 'git describe' to inject a
  version into the .cmake file. Fix this by replacing the
  placeholders using sed, injecting the rpm %version there.

- add remove-date-from-flatc-version.patch -- ensure reproducible builds
- update to 1.7.1
 * Calling CreateVector in C++ on a vector of Offset types with an explicit template parameter (of that Offset type) of could cause the wrong specialization to be selected in 1.7.0. This should affect very few people, but safer to use 1.7.1 just in-case. flatc from 1.7.0 is compatible with 1.7.1.
