- Fix build: RPM 4.15 got a bit stricter and fails on
  find-provides script errors. Earlier RPM versions ignored it. In
  this specic case it turns out that the .cmake file installed is
  invalid, as it contained set(PACKAGE_VERSION "..") (so RPM is
  right to abort). Turns out that upstream simply did not really
  cater for the fact that this could be installed from tarball and
  not from a git checkout: they use 'git describe' to inject a
  version into the .cmake file. Fix this by replacing the
  placeholders using sed, injecting the rpm %version there.

- add remove-date-from-flatc-version.patch -- ensure reproducible builds
- update to 1.7.1
 * Calling CreateVector in C++ on a vector of Offset types with an explicit template parameter (of that Offset type) of could cause the wrong specialization to be selected in 1.7.0. This should affect very few people, but safer to use 1.7.1 just in-case. flatc from 1.7.0 is compatible with 1.7.1.
- update to 1.7.0
 * Typescript support!
 * Improved GRPC API with proper zero-copy path. BREAKS API
 * Fixed many issues with ReleaseBufferPointer functionality BREAKS API
 * FlexBuffers: nested in FlatBuffer accessors, (nested) parsing from JSON, JSON output.
 * Vectors of unions and unions of structs/strings (C++ only so far).
 * Several speed optimizations for larger data types in C++ FlatBufferBuilder.
