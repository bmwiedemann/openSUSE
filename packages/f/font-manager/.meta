  <title>A simple font management application for Gtk+ Desktop Environments</title>
  <description>Font Manager is intended to provide a way for average users to easily
 manage desktop fonts, without having to resort to command line tools
 or editing configuration files by hand. While designed primarily with
 the Gnome Desktop Environment in mind, it should work well with other
 Gtk+ desktop environments.

Font Manager is NOT a professional-grade font management solution.
