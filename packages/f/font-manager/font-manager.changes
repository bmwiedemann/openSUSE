- update to 0.5.7:

  * dd font version field to the font information dialog
  * allow managing collections while in "Browse" mode
  * enable browse mode by default

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug  9 06:17:49 UTC 2010 - pascal.bleser@opensuse.org

- update to 0.5.6:

  * fix issue where failure to load a font file causes startup to abort with a useless error message
  * automatically try to move any customizations found in ~/.fonts.conf to ~/.config/font-manager/local.conf instead of simply overwriting them -- you should still edit local.conf directly and not rely on this
  * browse mode now displays disabled fonts and uses the same size setting as the rest of the application, it also includes a size slider
  * added a dialog which allows mass renaming and deletion of files in imported folders; this has to be enabled in the preferences dialog

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- update to 0.5.5:

  * fix issue where fonts with family names containing non-ASCII characters are unusable -- if you experienced this, please reset the applications cache to remove outdated entries
  * add a fontconfig editor which allows users to configure settings for individual families and styles; <matrix> transformations are not supported
  * add an alias editor which allows users to configure font substitution
  * cut down on the number of events that require a restart

- changes from 0.5.4:
  * fix several bugs introduced in the 0.5.x releases, hopefully without introducing new ones
  * several interface improvements, the most important one being that the application now saves most of it's state when closed, i.e. window size, preview font size, compare colors, pane positions, etc.
  * added an option to keep the current collection focused when adding families to other collections as suggested at http://code.google.com/p/font-manager/issues/detail?id=18
  * added a "browser mode" as suggested at http://code.google.com/p/font-manager/issues/detail?id=19
  * switch to Mallard-based help, unfortunately this means users who do not have Yelp installed will not have access to it
