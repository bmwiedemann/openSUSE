- update to version 3.2.1:
  Feature Improvements
  *  Add dictionary.ciena, dictionary.nile, and DHCPv4 dictionaries
  *  Add simultaneous-use queries for MS SQL
  *  Add radmin command for "stats pool <module-name>"
     which prints out statistics about the connection pools.
  *  Client statistics now shows "conflicts",
     to count conflicting packets.
  *  New optional "lightweight accounting-on/off" strategy.
     When refreshing queries.conf you should also add the new
     nasreload table and corresponding GRANTs to your DB schema.
  *  Add TLS-Client-Cert-X509v3-Certificate-Policies, which helps
     with Eduroam.
  *  Allow auth+acct for TCP sockets, too.
  *  Add rlm_cache_redis. See raddb/mods-available/cache for details.
  *  Allow radmin to look up home servers by name, too.
  *  Ensure that dynamic clients don't create loops on duplicates
  *  Removed rlm_sqlhpwippool. There was no documentation, no configuration,
     and the module was ~15 years old with no one using it.
  *  Marked rlm_python3 as stable.
  *  Add sigalgs_list. See raddb/mods-available/eap
  *  For rlm_linelog, when opening files in /dev, look at "permissions"
     to see whether to open them r/w.
  *  More flexibility for dynamic home servers. See
     doc/configuration/dynamic_home_servers.md and
     raddb/home_servers/README.md.
  *  Allow setting of application_name for PostgreSQL.
     See mods-available/sql.

  Bug Fixes
  *  Correct test for open sessions in radacct for MS SQL.
  *  The linelog module now opens /dev/stdout in "write-only" mode
     if the permissions are set to "u+w" (0002).
  *  Various fixes to rlm_unbound from Nick Porter.
  *  PEAP now correctly runs Post-Auth-Type Accept.
  *  Create "TLS-Cert-*" for outbound Radsec, instead of
     TLS-Client-Cert-* Fixes #4698. See sites-available/tls,
     and fix_cert_order.
  *  Minor updates and fixes to CI, Dockerfiles and packaging.
  *  Fix rlm_python3 build with python >= 3.10. Fixes #4441.

  Changes in version 3.2.0:
  Feature Improvements
  All features from 3.0.x are included in the 3.2.x releases.
  In addition:
  *  Add 'reset_day' and '%%r' parameter for rlm_sqlcounter to
     specify which day of the month the counter should be reset.
  *  Partial backport of rlm_json from v4, providing the json_encode
     xlat See mods-available/json for documentation.
  *  Support for haproxy "PROXY" protocol See sites-available/tls,
     "proxy_protocol" and doc/antora/modules/howto/pages/protocols/proxy/.
  *  Support for sending CoA-Request and Disconnect-Request packets
     in "reverse" down RadSec tunnels. Experimental for now,
     and undocumented.
  *  It is now possible to run a virtual server when saving / loading
     TLS cache attributes. See sites-available/tls-cache for more
     information.
  *  Removed the "cram" module. It was undocumented,
     and used old and insecure authentication methods.
  *  Remove the "otp" module. The "otpd" program it needs is
     no longer available, and the module has not been usable since
     at least 2015.
  *  All features from 3.0.x are included in the 3.2.x releases.
  *  3.2.0 requires OpenSSL 1.0.2 or greater.

Mon Jan 30 15:46:54 UTC 2017 - adam.majer@suse.de

- Merge changes from SLE to openSUSE (FATE#322416):
  * freeradius-server-radclient-init-error-buffer.patch - make sure
    we initialize error buffer. bsc#911886: radclient error free()
    invalid pointer

- update to 3.0.11 (fate#320481, bsc#961479, CVE-2015-8763,
  bsc#935573, CVE-2015-4680)
  * Changes of version 3.0.11
    + Feature improvements
      - "unlang" comparisons of IP addresses to IP prefixes are now
        detected, and types automatically cast.
      - Allow shorthand form of ipv4prefix values e.g. 127/8.
      - Add "auto_chain" to raddb/mods-available/eap, tls subsection.
        This allows the disabling of OpenSSL auto-chaining of
        certificates. Which might be wrong.
      - Added printing of coa and disconnect stats (radmin).
      - radclient defaults to expecting Access-Accept responses to
        Status-Server.
      - Updated dictionary.lancom, dictionary.starent.
      - Portability fixes for Solaris.
      - More errors from ntlm_auth gets passed to MS-CHAP.
      - Update abfab-tr-idp virtual server.
      - Added "filter_password" in policy.d/filter. This removes
        embedded zero bytes in User-Password, for compatibility with
        broken clients.
      - The server now issues a WARNING message if duplicate
        configuration items are found.
      - TLS can skip the "verify" section if OCSP returns OK. See
        raddb/mods-available/eap, "skip_if_ocsp_ok".
      - Set TLS-OCSP-Cert-Valid = yes / no / skipped, which is the
        result from the OCSP check.
      - Interoperate with AD and "LmCompatibiltyLevel = 5", by
        always setting WBC_MSV1_0_ALLOW_MSVCHAPV2 for native winbind
        in rlm_mschap.
      - TTLS and PEAP now require "virtual_server" to be a real
        server.
      - Print WARNING when TTLS or PEAP identities are spoofed or
        not properly anonymized. See RFC 7542 for requirements.
      - Various rlm_python fixes from Herwin Weststrate.
      - Allow setting Response-Packet-Type in "Post-Proxy-Type Fail",
        which is useful when the home server does not respond.
      - elasticsearch updates from Matthew Newton
    + Bug Fixes
      - Fix issue where field nas_type would not be accessible via
        the %{client:} xlat, for clients loaded from SQL.
      - Fix compatiblity issues with OpenSSL 1.0.2. Ignore calls to
        msg_callback with 'pseudo' content types.
      - Data type "ipv4prefix" is parsed correctly.
      - Use correct talloc context in rlm_exec. Fixes #1338.
      - Complain in unlang if "else" is used with no previous "if"
        or "elsif".
      - Send accounting status packets to the accounting port.
        Fixes #1364.
      - Print out CFLAGS when doing "radiusd -Xxv"
      - Fixed bug with coa/acct stats value #1339. Based on patch
        from Jorge Pereira.
      - Fixes for LEAP proxying. Don't use LEAP!
      - Fix issue with "directory already exists" seen when doing
        "make install".
      - Fixed bug with radmin related to the option "stats detail
        <filename>"
      - Complain if the detail file reader does not have permission
        to read the "detail.work" file. Fixes #1398
      - Fixed SoH. Attributes were not being copied to the virtual
        server.
      - Used a wrong list to global statistics in "stats".
      - Create EAP-PWD identity correctly. Prevents segfaults.
      - Dynamically validate authentication types for PEAP and
        EAP-MSCHAPv2.
      - Fix includes in installed headers.
      - OpenSSL 1.0.1f and 1.0.1g do NOT calculate TLS 1.2 keys
        correctly. See raddb/mods-available/eap, "disable_tlsv1_2"
      - Allow password change to work for MS-CHAP. This requires
        'r=0', because password changes are not retries.
      - Fix home server fail-over for home servers using TCP and/or
        RadSec.
      - Special characters in expanded regexes are now escaped e.g.
        User-Name containing '.', and comparing /%{User-Name}/, the
        '.' will now be escaped. See src/tests/keywords/regex-escape.
      - Use correct authentication vector when sending Access-Reject
        replies for RadSec.
      - Set FreeRADIUS-Proxied-To in TTLS again. You should use the
        "inner-tunnel" virtual server, instead of relying on this
        attribute.
      - Fix debugging constants in rlm_perl. Patch from Herwin
        Weststrate.
      - Add samba-dev / samba4-dev to debian builds so that
        rlm_mschap can automatically use the new winbind API.
      - Automatically skip zero-length attributes when sending
        packets, instead of erroring out.

- update to 3.0.10
  * Changes of version 3.0.10
    + Feature improvements
      - Do more optimization of unlang policies. This makes run-time
        a bit faster.
      - Re-name most of the functions in src/lib. Third-party module
        authors will have to do the same.
      - More documentation on contributing and how to write modules.

      - Add dictionary for Boingo Wi-Fi
      - Add support for DHCP lease queries.
        See raddb/sites-available/dhcp
      - On HUP, check all modules for config files which have
        changed. And only re-load those modules.
      - Allow FreeRADIUS-Response-Delay(-USec) to be set for RADIUS
        packets. Patch from Herwin Weststrate.
      - Documentation fixes from Alan Buxey and Matthew Newton.
      - Update "logrotate" script.
      - Added more RFCs to doc/rfc for new standards implemented by
        FreeRADIUS.
      - Don't crash when doing "radmin -e "help hup". Patch from
        Matthew Newton.
      - The dictionary parser now does more sanity checks, which
        prevents run-time problems with invalid attributes.
      - Update debian packages. Patches from Christopher Hoskin.
      - Many other debian packaging fixes from Matthew Netwon and
        Herwin Weststrate.
      - Add "session-state" to Perl. Patch from Herwin Weststrate.
    + Bug Fixes
      - Fix rlm_files so that there are no collisions when loading
        10's of 1000's of users.
      - Fix radclient to use our internal v4/v6 parsing functions.
        v6 addresses with ports now work correctly.
      - Fix sending/receiving packet messages to wrap v6 addresses
        in square brackets '[]'.
      - Check for sasl/sasl.h when building rlm_ldap, and disable
        SASL functionality if unavailable.
      - Fix issue which caused a non \0 terminated buffer to be
        assigned to attributes if the value being assigned contained
        an invalid escape sequence.
      - Fix deadlock when reconnecting connections in the connection
        pool.
      - Fix potential overrun in functions that used fr_utf8_char
        with a non nul terminated buffer.
      - Fix decoding issue for Tunnel-Password type attributes which
        were very long. Found by Denis Andzakovic.
      - Fix radclient issue with TCP sockets on FreeBSD.
      - The server now creates ${run_dir} and ${logdir} directories
        in daemon mode, when running as "root".
      - Handle tags when using maps. Fixes #1191.
      - Fix crash when CoA packets time out.
      - Fix parse error in rediswho
      - Fix regex support in SQL radcheck the "users" file and
        radsniff.
      - Register listen xlat earlier, so that it's available when
        the virtual servers are being parsed.

      - Allow old-style clients again. They will be disallowed for
        3.1.0 and following.
      - Complain instead of crash when "else" and "elsif" are in the
        wrong place.
      - Clean up memory more aggressively. This lowers the maximum
        memory used, most typically for TLS based EAP methods.
      - Prevent the server from unlinking the control socket of an
        already running instance.
      - Fallback to using the configured OCSP URL if one exists, and
        no URL is provided in the certificate.
      - Return CoA-NAK if proxying CoA fails. Based on patch from
        Jorge Pereira.
      - Lower peak memory usage by decreasing size of internal
        memory pools.
      - The control socket is now left in place if a second copy of
        the server is accidentally started.
      - Allow virtual attributes in "switch", "case", etc. Fixes
        #1240 and #1265.
      - Many spell check / typo fixes in comments and example
        configuration files.
      - Better handle multiple DHCP listeners.
      - Don't print secrets for old-style realms. Fixes #1267.
      - Don't fall through in empty "case" statements. Fixes #1274.
      - Update EAP-TTLS so that MPPE keys are correctly calculated
        with TLSv1.2.
      - Always delete MS-MPPE-* from the TTLS inner tunnel. This
        allows TTLS / EAP-MSCHAPv2 to work. Fixes #1206.
      - Fix off by one error that caused some MSCHAP-Error messages
        to be sent without the password change version (V=3) and the
        textual message component (M=).
      - Always include C= V= and M= in MSCHAPv2 errors. RFC 2759
        does not say that any of these fields are optional, and not
        including V= caused errors with wpa_supplicant.
      - Do not include M= in MSCHAPv1 errors. It's not supported.

- update to 3.0.9
  * Changes of version 3.0.9
    + Feature improvements
      - Make "pool" configurations more consistent, and update
        documentation for them.
      - Move connection pool logic to "most recently started",
        instead of MRU. This should help with pool stability.
      - More VSAs for 3GPP2
      - Added examples of multi-value attributes to rlm_perl.
      - LDAP-Group and SQL-Group attributes are now dynamically
        allocated.
      - Only the "sql" module registers SQL-Group. Other instances
        register "instance-name-SQL-Group", similarly to "ldap".
      - Unknown attributes are now complained about more often when
        used in unlang statements. e.g. if (Foo-Bar == 3) used to be
        a string to string comparison. It is now a parse error.
      - Rename RLM_COMPONENT_* to MOD_* in the code. This makes many
        things easier.
      - Move to C99 initializers for modules.
      - Load modules in raddb/mods-enabled. This allows attributes
        like "LDAP-Group" to be used in the "files" module, without
        explicit ordering or listing in "instantiate".
      - Added 'bootstrap' section to modules. Third-party modules
        will need to be updated.
      - When adding clients from a DB, add them to a virtual server
        if that virtual server has a "listen" section. Otherwise,
        add the clients to the global list.
      - When reading dynamic clients from a file, don't expire them
        if the underlying file is unchanged.
      - Allow the server to originate CoA requests from the
        post-auth stage.
      - The server creates ${run_dir} and ${logdir} in daemon mode,
        if they do not already exist.
      - Add dictionary for Wi-Fi Alliance Hotspot 2.0. The server
        now supports all mandatory and optional attributes for this
        specification.
      - HUP now re-loads the configuration only if the files have
        changed. If all files are unchanged, HUP re-opens the log
        file, and does nothing else.
      - Much better debug messages for EAP-TLS, including which
        attributes are cached, and when they are retrieved.
      - Increase default max_requests to 16384. Memory is cheap now.
      - Added "stats memory" commands to radmin. Debug build only.
      - Aptilo controller dictionary updates.
      - SQL modules now use Acct-Unique-Session-Id everywhere.
      - The redis modules are now stable.
      - The LDAP module now supports SASL "interactive bind" method.
        This allows Kerberos based administrator and user binds.
      - DHCP code is now in libfreeradius-dhcp.
      - More DHCP encoding / decoding unit tests.
      - rlm_replicate can now be listed in the "accounting" section.
      - Better sqlite debugging output.
      - Remove "required" option from many sql_ippool directives.
      - Set default CA "basic constraints" to "critical". Fixes #1073
      - Updates to help / man pages from Jorge Pereira.
      - Added more tests.
    + Bug Fixes
      - Be more careful about unused config item warnings when
        using -Xx.
      - Move more defines to be auto-generated.
      - Allow virtual servers in proxy fallback.
      - Allow %{module:} to work.
      - Don't crash in RadSec. Closes #980.
      - Return better errors when a unix group / user is not found.
      - Re-enable detail module "locking" parameter.
      - Don't crash when logging replies from Status-Server packets.
      - The couchbase module now uses "update" instead of "map", for
        consistent with the rest of the server.
        See raddb/mods-available/couchbase
      - Don't require NT-Password for MS-CHAP password changes.
      - Be a bit more careful about decrypting MS-CHAP-MPPE-Key
        attributes. Closes #1013. There is no perfect fix, tho.
      - Fix security issues with EAP-PWD.
        See http://freeradius.org/security.html#eap-pwd-2015
      - Fix dynamic clients read from SQL in non-debug mode
      - MS-CHAP now allows retries (i.e. password change) when
        passwords are expired.
      - Allow "user=radiusd" when the server is already user
        "radiusd"
      - suid up/down works on non-Linux systems. This means that the
        control socket should have the correct ownership.
      - Fix issue which caused the server to sometimes have problems
        when a home server was marked zombie.
      - Fix format.pl because Perl is now more picky.
      - Fix proxy to Packet-Dst-IP-Address, so that it uses the
        correct destination port.
      - Fix corner case with cursor functions and removal.
      - OpenDirectory fixes and documentation.
      - Fix leaks in rlm_redis.
      - RFC 6929 "evs" attributes are now encoded / decoded properly.
      - Fix talloc pool leaks when receiving malformed or
        retransmitted Accounting/CoA requests.
      - Printed attributes again use double quotes instead of single
        quotes.
      - Set X509_V_FLAG_CRL_CHECK_ALL, and add "check_all_crl" to
        eap.conf. Fixes oCert CVE-2015-4680.
      - rlm_expr now errors out correctly on malformed attribute
        references instead of triggering an assert.
      - Make "break" work in "foreach" loops
      - Allow dynamic expansions to work again in the "hints" file.
      - Correct minor typos in comments and examples from Alan Buxy.
      - Re-urlencode the path portion of ldapi:// urls before
        passing it to ldap_initialise.
- freeradius-server-rlm_sql_unixodbc-configure.patch removes
  hard-coded directory in configure script of rlm_sql_unixodbc
- install new module rlm_sqlhpwippool.so

      - Allow defaults to be set for bulk clients in LDAP and
        couchbase.
      - Updates to dhcpclient. Patches from Nicolas C.
      - rlm_mschap now supports direct connections to winbind,
        which is faster than ntlm_auth.
        See raddb/mods-available/mschap. Patch from Matthew Newton.
      - Recommend /dev/urandom for TLS randomness, instead of
        ${certdir}/random
      - Allow TLSv1 to be disabled via "disable_tlsv1" in tls{}.
      - Allow Expanded EAP types where vendor is 0 (IETF) and type
        is normal EAP type. Supplicants sending Expanded EAP types
        like this are broken.
      - Add support for server side sort controls when searching
        for user objects in rlm_ldap.
    + Bug Fixes
      - Don't complain about "authorize" in "server {}" blocks, but
        only if there's no "server" block.
      - Fix cosmetic issue where debug from the first packet read by
        a detail reader thread would be emited during config parsing.
      - Fix ASSERT on truncated detail packets.
      - Don't use main server log functions from within panic_action,
        as in the case of syslog this would cause deadlocks if the
        fault was triggered from within a malloc.
      - Fix issue in "switch" when "correct_escapes = false".
        Fixes #911.
      - Fix sqlcounter configuration to use "%%b" instead of "%b",
        otherwise the new syntax validation will fail.

        aren't always loaded in a sane order.
      - Fix more escaping issues. Closes #912.
      - Decode MAC addresses correctly for VMPS.
      - Fix memory leak with TLS connections.
      - Fix state machine threading issues for conflicting packets.
      - Fix copy_request_to_tunnel issues for tagged attributes.
      - Allow "ok" to over-ride "updated" inside of Auth-Type
        sections.
      - Update state machine so that post-proxy is run though child
        threads for performance, instead of blocking the main thread.
      - Allow "netmask" to work again in client definitions.
      - Relax restrictions on SQL group queries.
      - track outgoing proxy sockets and clean them up more
        aggressively.
      - track proxy statistics, including CoA and Disconnect.
      - If radmin has a connection failure when running a command,
        it re-connects and runs the command again.
      - mark home servers "unknown" less aggressively.
      - Fix potential SEGV in PostgreSQL driver on error.
      - Fix issue where fields like nas_type would not be
        accessible via the %{client:} xlat, for dynamic clients.
      - Set default busy_timeout (of 200ms) in the sqlite driver, so
        writes don't cause selects to fail in multithreaded mode.
        This is user configurable, and may be increased if required.
      - Convert Password-With-Header attributes to binary (from hex
        or base64), in the authorize method of rlm_pap.
      - Fix invalid assert in state.c, that could cause abort in
        post-auth.
      - Fix double free when -m flag is used, and connection pools
        are referenced by multiple modules.
      - RADIUS over TLS accounting uses the same port as
        authentication.
      - Regularized return codes from radmin commands.
      - Fix RHEL spec file so it works correctly for Centos7 which
        uses systemd, and didn't like the SystemV init script.
      - radwho and radlast now have a -D option to load dictionaries
      - DHCP packets are no longer checked for duplicates.
      - Don't crash in sql module group comparisons in corner case.
      - Calculate MPPE keys correctly when using TLS 1.2.
      - Fix load-balance sections. Closes #945
      - TLS certificates are available again in the post-auth
        section. They are not available for session resumption.
      - radclient encodes CHAP-Password properly when using -c
        Closes #955.
      - Fix issue in rlm_cache_memcached driver that caused variable
        length values to be truncated.
      - Fix track functionality in detail reader, so it no longer
        fails with a "Failed marking detail request as done: Bad
        file descriptor" error.
      - Actually add the peer identity (as User-Name) to the inner
        tunnel in EAP-PWD requests, so it's available for lookups.
      - Fixes to PostgreSQL queries. Patches from Santiago Gimeno.
- new set of consolidated patch files:

  * radmin auto-reconnects if the connection to the server has gone away.
  * rlm_cache now has submodule support. See raddb/mods-available/cache
  * New memcached driver for rlm_cache. See raddb/mods-available/cache
  * Add support for &Attribute-Name[*] in conditions. See "man unlang" for details.
  * Add &Attribute-Name[n] which gets the last instance of an attribute e.g. Module-Failure-Message[n].
  * Allow for redundant string expansions. See the "instantiate" section of radiusd.conf.
  * When checking IP addresses in conditions, make the right side be parsed as an IP prefix.
  * Support JIT compilation of compiled regular expressions when built with libpcre.
  * Support named capture groups with "%{regex:<name>}" when built with libpcre.
  * Increase regular expression capture groups from 8 to 32.
  * Emit error markers for badly formed regular expressions.
  * Allow 'm' flag to enable multiline mode in regular expressions.
  * Support limited implicit attribute conversion in update sections.
  * Support casting between IPv6 and IPv4 where the IPv6 address has the v4/v6 mapping prefix (::ffff:).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec 22 09:09:16 UTC 2014 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Drop .keyring and .sig file: freeradius-server still uses MD5
  signatures, which are no longer validated/accepted by GPG 2.1.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec  3 14:22:03 UTC 2014 - vcizek@suse.com

- update to 3.0.5
  Some of the new features:
  * Allow LDAP to specify arbitrary attributes for dynamic
    clients.
  * Allow one level of backslashes (finally).  See radiusd.conf,
    "correct_escapes" setting.
  * When supported by OpenSSL, allow TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.2
    in EAP methods.
  * Allow multiple new connections to be spawned simultaneously
    in the connection pool, to cope with spikes in traffic.
  * Use kqueue on systems which support it.  This allows for
    better scaling when using many sockets.
  * Home server "response_window" can now take fractions of a
    second.  See proxy.conf.
  * radmin now supports "show module status", as thee counterpart
    to "set module status"
  * "ipaddr" will now use v6 if no v4 address is present.  You should
    use "ipv4addr" or "ipv6addr" to force v4/v6 addresses.
  * "client" sections will allow "ipaddr = 192.192.0/24".  The old
    "netmask" is still accepted, but the new format is preferred.
  * Allow custom HTTP headers to be set for rlm_rest requests using
    control:REST-HTTP-Header (attributes consumed after use).
  * Extend format of %{rest:} expansion to allow HTTP method and POST
    data to be specified
    and urlquoting.
  * Add support for aliases in rlm_ldap.
  * Add support for connection pool sharing to all modules that use
    the connection pool (pool = <instance>).
  * "tls" sections now have a "psk_query" configuration item, for dynamic
    queries to discover a key from a PSK identity.
  * Preliminary support for EAP channel bindings.
  * Foundational work for dynamic home servers.  They do not yet work,
    but this is now only a matter of updating the "realm" module in
    a future release.
  * Support &attr[*] syntax to copy all instances of an attribute when
    used with the += operator in an update section. May be qualified with
    a tag.
  * The logintime and expiration modules can now be listed in the
    post-auth section.  This makes some configurations simpler.
  * rlm_sqlippool is now IPV6 capable.  Set "ipv6 = yes" to get
    Framed-IPv6-Prefix returned.  The SQL queries have NOT been updated.
    Please submit patches.

	Many bugfixes
	Feature improvements
	* Everything now builds with no warnings from the C compiler,
	  clang static analyzer, or cppcheck.
	* rlm_ldap now supports defining the LDAP attribute name via
	  backticked expansion (i.e. shell command) in
	  RADIUS <-> LDAP mappings.
	* rlm_ldap now supports older style generic attributes.
	* dynamic expansions (e.g. "%{expr:1 + 2}" are now parsed
	  when the server starts.  Syntax errors in the strings
	  are caught, and a descriptive error is printed.
	* Static regular expressions (e.g. /a*b/) are now parsed
	  when the server starts.  Syntax errors in the strings
	  are caught, and a descriptive error is printed.
	* dynamic expansions are cached after being parsed.  They are
	  no longer re-parsed at run-time for every request.
	* regular expressions are now parsed and cached when the server
	  starts.
	* Added the %{rest:} expansion to rlm_rest, which will send
	  a GET request to the URL passed as the format string.
	  Any body text will be written to the expansion buffer.
	* rlm_rest now available as a debian package.
	* When an 'if' condition statically evaluates to true/false,
	  unlang does more static optimization.  For examples, see
	  src/tests/keywords/if-skip
	* All modules are marked as safe for '-C', which lets the
	  dynamic expansion checks work in more situations.
	* Added 'none' and 'custom' rlm_rest body types. 'custom'
	  allows sending of arbitrary expanded text and content-type
	  headers.
	* Added "config" section to Perl.  See mods-available/perl
	* Added '%v' which expands to the server version - Patch
	  from Alan Buxey.
	* more mis-matched casts are caught in "if" conditions,
	  and descriptive errors are printed.
	* Support basic response validation in radclient. This allows
	  administrators to write local test cases for their
	  site-specific configurations.
	* Removed radconf2xml and radmin "show client config" and
	  "show home_server config".
	* Forbid running with vulnerable versions of OpenSSL.
	  See "allow_vulnerable_openssl" in the "security"
	  subsection of "radiusd.conf"
	* Catch underlying "heartbleed" problem, so that nothing bad
	  happens even when using a vulnerable version of OpenSSL.
	* Add locking API for sql_null, linelog, and detail modules,
	  which should improve performance and work around issues
	  on platforms with bad file locking.
	* Allow DHCP NAKs to be delayed, via setting
	  reply:FreeRADIUS-Response-Delay = 1
	* Allow tag and array references anywhere attributes
	  are allowed in "unlang".
	* many enhancements to radsniff, including output
	  to collectd, ipv6 support and packet loss statistics.
	* Many dictionary updates (ZTE, Brocade, Motorola).
	* rlm_yubikey now automatically splits passwords from OTP
	  strings.
	* The detail file reader is now threaded by default.
	  This should improve performance reading the files.
- dropped freeradius-server-CVE-2014-2015.patch (upstream)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb 28 09:04:08 UTC 2014 - vcizek@suse.com

- remove the old 3.0.0 sources

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jan 25 14:44:31 UTC 2014 - mardnh@gmx.de

- update to 3.0.1
    Feature improvements
    * Add "timeout" to exec, and "ntlm_auth_timeout" to mschap.
      So that run-away child processes are caught earlier.
    * Allow TLS clients to use "proto = tls", in which case
      TLS is required.  The shared secret is then set to "radsec".
    * More documentation in the tls virtual server.
    * Add "date" module for date formatting.
      See raddb/mods-available/date.
    * Added unit test suite for internal server functionality
    * When loading "update" sections, check if the RHS is a literal
      value.  If so, syntax check it immediately.
    * Update LDAP module documentation and functionality.
      The generic attribute can now update lists.
    * Updated dictionary.extreme.
    * Update sqlippool to do clears as a separate transaction,
      and at most once per second.  This should help MySQL.
    * Respect control:Response-Packet-Type for all types of
      requests.
    * Add support for SSL encryption to the MySQL driver.
    * Allow arbitrary connection parameters to be used with the
      PostgreSQL driver.
    * Changes to the OpenLDAP schema to fully expose functionality
      of the new LDAP module.
    * Update debian packaging to include a freeradius-config
      package. This package may be provided as a site local
      package to avoid fighting with the preinstalled config
      files.
    Bug fixes
    * Use correct field for ARP setting in DHCP.
    * Fix crash on debug condition (#454).
    * Fix a number of minor issues caught by the clang
      analyzer.
    * Set WARNING messages to yellow instead of normal text.
    * Correct debug colorise logic.  Patch from Phil Mayers.
    * Encode attributes of type "ethernet".  No one uses them,
      but it makes sense.
    * Work around regex initialization issues.
    * Fix build when linking against OpenSSL.
    * Print IDs as positive numbers, which helps for large DHCP
      XIDs.
    * Fix issue with sql_ippool.
    * sqlcounter now uses 64-bit counters, to deal with 4G overflow.
    * Fix issues with DHCP subsystem.
    * Don't build / install disabled modules, or their config
      files.
    * Fix build for OSX Mavericks, which hid the header files
      in a magical place.
    * Fix LEAP buffer issue.  You should still avoid LEAP.
    * Mark "unknown" WiMAX attributes as being WiMAX.
    * Fix typo in packet decoder for fragmented extended attrs
    * RPM spec fixes.
    * Fix rlm_perl build issues when not using threads.
    * Enable %{Response-Packet-Type} again.
    * Update configuration file parser to handle "bool"
      consistently.
    * Update declarations of global boolean variables to use
      "bool" consistently. This fixes an issue where some
      modules were instantiated in "config check" mode and
      did not work correctly.
    * Make more messages debug instead of info, to avoid
      polluting the logs with messages that can't be fixed.
    * Set operator in internal unlang code to suppress spurious
      warning messages.
    * Fix debian packaging.
    * Added "status" to Debian init script.
    * Fix "update outer.request" to update the outer request.
    * Don't print TLS debugging messages when not in debug mode.
    * Correctly manage counters for "limit" sections of TCP / TLS
      "listen" sockets.
    * Fix libldap debug output.
    * Fix rlm_ldap tls functionality.
    * Initialise OpenSSL globals early to avoid issues with the
      PostgreSQL library.
    * Fix typo in sqlcounter expansion code.  Fixes #463
    * Overwrite previous instances of SQL-User-Name when adding
      it to the request.
    * Work around bugs in both MIT and heimdal versions of
      krb5_copy_context(), which caused segfaults in
      multithreaded mode.
    * Provide meaningful error messages if Heimdal krb5 is used.
    * Fix attribute supression in rlm_detail.
    * Exit with error code if child fails to complete server
      initialisation after forking.  This allows init scripts to
      correctly report whether the server started ok.

  o Feature improvements
	* radclient exits with 0 on successful (accept / ack), and 1
	  otherwise (no response / reject)
	* Added support for %{sql:UPDATE ..}, and insert/delete
	  Patch from Arran Cudbard-Bell
	* Added sample "do not respond" policy.  See raddb/policy.conf
	  and raddb/sites-available/do_not_respond
	* Cleanups to Suse spec file from Norbert Wegener
	* New VSAs for Juniper from Bjorn Mork
	* Include more RFC dictionaries in the default install
	* More documentation for the WiMAX module
	* Added "chase_referrals" and "rebind" configuration to rlm_ldap.
	  This helps with Active Directory.  See raddb/modules/ldap
	* Don't load pre/post-proxy if proxying is disabled.
	* Added %{md5:...}, which returns MD5 hash in hex.
	* Added configurable "retry_interval" and "poll_interval"
	  for "detail" listeners.
	* Added "delete_mppe_keys" configuration option to rlm_wimax.
	  Apparently some WiMAX clients misbehave when they see those keys.
	* Added experimental rlm_ruby from
	  http://github.com/Antti/freeradius-server/tree/master
	* Add Tunnel attributes to ldap.attrmap
	* Enable virtual servers to be reloaded on HUP.  For now, only
	  the "authorize", "authenticate", etc. processing sections are
	  reloaded.  Clients and "listen" sections are NOT reloaded.
	* Updated "radwatch" script to be more robust.  See scripts/radwatch
	* Added certificate compatibility notes in raddb/certs/README,
	  for compatibility with different operating systems. (i.e. Windows)
  o Bug fixes
	* Minor changes to allow building without VQP.
	* Minor fixes from John Center
	* Fixed raddebug example
	* Don't crash when deleting attributes via unlang
	* Be friendlier to very fast clients
	* Updated the "detail" listener so that it only polls once,
	  and not many times in a row, leaking memory each time...
	* Update comparison for Packet-Src-IP-Address (etc.) so that
	  the operators other than '==' work.
	* Did autoconf magic to work around weird libtool bug
	* Make rlm_perl keep tags for tagged attributes in more situations
	* Update UID checking for radmin
	* Added "include_length" field for TTLS.  It's needed for RFC
	  compliance, but not (apparently) for interoperability.
  - FreeRADIUS 2.1.5
	* Release number skipped due to procedural issues.
  - FreeRADIUS 2.1.4
  o	Feature improvements
	* Permit multiple "-e" in radmin.
	* Add support for originating CoA-Request and Disconnect-Request.
	  See raddb/sites-available/originate-coa.
	* Added "lifetime" and "max_queries" to raddb/sql.conf.
	  This helps address the problem of hung SQL sockets.
	* Allow packets to be injected via radmin.  See "inject help"
	  in radmin.
	* Answer VMPS reconfirmation request.  Patch from Hermann Lauer.
	* Sample logrotate script in scripts/logrotate.freeradius
	* Add configurable poll interval for "detail" listeners
	* New "raddebug" command.  This prints debugging information from
	  a running server.  See "man raddebug.
	* Add "require_message_authenticator" configuration to home_server
	  configuration.  This makes the server add Message-Authenticator
	  to all outgoing Access-Request packets.
	* Added smsotp module, as contributed by Siemens.
	* Enabled the administration socket in the default install.
	  See raddb/sites-available/control-socket, and "man radmin"
	* Handle duplicate clients, such as with replicated or
	  load-balanced SQL servers and "readclients = yes"
  o Bug fixes
	* Clean up control sockets when they are closed, so that we don't
	  leak memory.
	* Define SUN_LEN for systems that don't have it.
	* Correct some boundary conditions in the conditional checker ("if")
	  in "unlang".  Bug noted by Arran Cudbard-Bell.
	* Work around minor building issues in gmake.  This should only
	  have affected developers.
	* Change how we manage unprivileged user/group, so that we do not
	  create control sockets owned by root.
	* Fixed more minor issues found by Coverity.
	* Allow raddb/certs/bootstrap to run when there is no "make"
	  command installed.
	* In radiusd.conf, run_dir depends on the name of the program,
	  and isn't hard-coded to "..../radiusd"
	* Check for EOF in more places in the "detail" file reader.
	* Added Freeswitch dictionary.
	* Chop ethernet frames in VMPS, rather than droppping packets.
	* Fix EAP-TLS bug.  Patch from Arnaud Ebalard
	* Don't lose string for regex-compares in the "users" file.
	* Expose more functions in rlm_sql to rlm_sqlippool, which 
	  helps on systems where RTLD_GLOBAL is off.
	* Fix typos in MySQL schemas for ippools.
	* Remove macro that was causing build issues on some platforms.
	* Fixed issues with dead home servers.  Bug noted by Chris Moules.
	* Fixed "access after free" with some dynamic clients.

- do not ship static modules 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb 10 10:38:27 CET 2009 - prusnak@suse.cz

- updated to 2.1.3
  o Feature Improvements
    * Allow running with user=radiusd and binding to secure sockets.
    * Start sending Status-Server "are you alive" messages earlier,
      which helps with proxying multiple realms to a home server.
    * Removed thread pool code from rlm_perl. It's not necessary.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep  9 19:49:08 CEST 2008 - prusnak@suse.cz

- updated to 2.1.0
  o Feature Improvements

    * Debug logs can now be turned on/off while the server is running,
      for a user, group, realm, etc. See the log section of raddb/radiusd.conf.
    * Added support for WiMAX Forum attributes. The dynamic keys are
      not yet calculated. See share/dictionary.wimax

      can go to the log file, and not stdout.
    * Added dictionary.rfc5176
    * EAP module now checks for instance name, and uses that for
      authentication.  This avoids the need to set Auth-Type when
      there are multiple instances of the EAP module.
    * Added Module-Return-Code attribute, which contains the value
      returned by the previous module (ok/fail/update/etc.)
    Bug fixes
    * Corrected typos in rlm_dbm.  Closes bugs #521 and #522.
    * Detail file "listen" sections now work much better.
    * Don't allow old "log_*" to over-ride new format.  Closes bug #525
    * Initialize allocated memory in Oracle SQL driver.  This fixes
      occasional crashes on some systems.  Closes bug #518
    * Call correct function in rlm_protocol_filter.  This enables the
      module to build.  Closes bug #512.
    * Added deprecated flag to build for rlm_krb5.  This allows it to
      run on 64-bit systems.  Closes bug #491

      needed for importing CA certs into Windows.
    * Added ability send raw attributes via "Raw-Attribute = 0x0102..."
      This is available only debug builds.  It can be used
      to create invalid packets! Use it with care.
    * Permit "unlang" policies inside of Auth-Type{} sub-sections
      of the authenticate{} section.  This makes some policies easier
      to implement.
    * "listen" sections can now have "type = proxy".  This lets you
      control which IP is used for sending proxied requests.
    * Added note on SSL performance to raddb/certs/README

      Based on a patch from Vincent Magnin.
    * Updated example raddb/sites-available/proxy-inner-tunnel
    * Corrected behavior of attr_filter to match documentation.
      This is NOT backwards compatible with previous versions!
      See "man rlm_attr_filter" for details.

    * Debugging mode is much clearer and easier to read.
    * A new policy language makes many configurations trivial.
      See "man unlang" for a complete description.
    * Virtual servers are now supported.  This permits clear separation
      of policies.  See raddb/sites-available/README
    * EAP-TLS (PEAP, EAP-TTLS) and OpenSSL certificates "just work".
      See raddb/certs/README for details.
    * Proxying is much more configurable than before.
      See proxy.conf for documentation on pools, and new config items.
    * Full support for IPv6.
    * Much more complete support for the RADIUS SNMP MIBs.
    * HUP now works.  Only some modules are re-loaded,
      and the server configuation is *not* reloaded.

    * Output more information on blocked threads, which should help
      narrow down which modules is causing the problem.
    * Added more eDirectory support.
    * rlm_ldap now prints out attributes in the standard format
    * Enabled server-side handling of procedures in MySQL
    Bug Fixes

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr 20 15:10:28 CEST 2007 - pth@suse.de

- Update to 1.1.6. Changes since 1.1.3:
    Feature improvements
    * Added dictionary.rfc4372 (Chargeable User Identity)
    * Added dictionary.rfc4675 (VLAN and Priority)
    * Added dictionary.rfc4679 (ADSL Forum)
      NOTE some name differences from the RFC, due to dictionary.redback
    * Updated rlm_python to something usable
    * Added experimental sql "HPW" IPPools.
    * Added more dictionaries
    * Dictionary files now MUST NOT be globally writable.
    * Configuration files now MUST NOT be globally readable,
      or globally writable.
    * Be more aggressive about freeing memory on clean exit.
      This helps track down run-time leaks.
    * Updated rlm_python to something usable
    * Added experimental sql "HPW" IPPools.
    * Major enhancements to rlm_pap, that make "encryption_scheme"
      a thing of the past.  See "man rlm_pap" for details.
    * Added SSL_OP_DONT_INSERT_EMPTY_FRAGMENTS flag to use
      work-arounds that enable Windows Vista clients to work.
    * Added preliminary code to support Firebird.
      Use at your own risk!
    * Send MS-CHAP2-Success, which makes EAP-TTLS/MSCHAP work on more
      platforms.
    * Add a new "reply-name" directive in rlm_sqlcounter to define the
      name of the reply attribute.
    * Added more dictionaries and attributes
    * Print ntlm_auth failure reason in Module-Failure-Message
    * radsqlrelay is able to get the DB password from a file instead
      of command line.

    Bug fixes
    * Corrected typo in rlm_pap.c
    * Corrected typo in src/main/auth.c
    * Suppress SSL error messages if error is zero.
    * Don't complain about "Error in read client certificate A"
      if we expect to read it in the next packet.  Fix based on patch
      by Dan Lukes.
    * Corrected nearly 30 bugs found by Coverity
      See also http://scan.coverity.com
    * Don't die on HUP.  Instead leak memory (sorry).  After a few
      hundred HUP's, the server will have leaked a few megabytes of
      memory, and you should probably re-start it.  It's ugly, but
      better than dying.
    * Corrected a few double free's
    * Corrected typo in radrelay, which prevented it from working
    * Made Firebird module build
    * Fixed bug in PostgreSQL module that caused server crash.
    * Fixed bug in SQL module that could cause server to crash.
    * Corrected base64 decoding in rlm_pap
    * Don't retransmit accounting packets.  The NAS should do this.
    * Handle Client-Error in EAP-SIM.
    * Port OpenSSL locking fixes from CVS head.  This makes PEAP
      more stable on some systems.
    * Require Message-Authenticator in Status-Server packets
    * Correct Tunnel-Medium-Type VALUEs in dictionary.rfc2868
    * Be more aggressibe about freeing memory on clean exit.
      This isn't strictly a bug fix, but it makes it easier to
      find memory leaks
    * Increase buffer size for dynamic expansion, which allows
      longer SQL qeuries.
    * Use correct line number when there's a parse error in one
      of the configuration sections.
    * Terminate SSL sessions in EAP on error, rather than continuing
      in some cases.
    * Increase buffer size to allow parsing of long octet strings
    * Fix string termination on xlat in rlm_perl
    * Fix a parse error in the digest module, where malformed
      digest requests would result in the user being accepted.  Oops...
    * VALUEs can only be defined for 'integer', to catch mistakes
      with setting VALUEs for type 'string'.
    * Better parsing of VALUE names, so that values starting with
      a digit work correctly.
    * Check return from malloc.
    * Fix a double free() in rlm_eap_tls.c
    * Check return code of malloc() during initialization.
    * Fix a corner case where the proxy port isn't set either in
      radiusd.conf or in proxy.conf.
