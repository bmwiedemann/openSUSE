- Update to version 0.0.0+git20211018:
  * changelog: Bump changes line to a recent date too. It was still
    stuck at 2021-10-07. Fixup version too while at that.
- Changes from version 0.0.0+git20210426:
  * implement fbd_dev_sound_stop
    tracks the FdbFeedbackSounds in a GHashTable in the FdbDevSound
  * fbd-dev-sound: Don't leak GError
  * fbd-dev-sound: Don't warn when sound was cancelled. This is not
    an error per se.
  * lfb-event: Don't leak error.
    Don't leak the error values in the success case
  * tests: Run lfb_event_{get,set}_timeout
  * test-lfb-integration: Test invocation error
  * event: Make log-domain match source file name
  * tests: Run event tests too
  * event: Remove 'g' prefix from common C types.
    This matchs phosh's style.
  * fbd-event: Add sender property.
    This allows us to store the DBus sender
  * fbd-manager: Keep DBus sender around
  * feedback-manager: Track DBus clients and end feedbacks if they
    go away. When the client goes away we build up a list of events
    to end feedback for to make sure the hash table isn't modified
    in place. The alternative approach would be to disconnect the
    on_event_feedbacks_ended handler, duplicate the DBus signal
    emission and use g_hash_table_foreach_remove but that looks
    less robust than using the same code path.
  * Help emacs to indent properly
  * fbd-feedback-theme: Don't leak JSON node
  * fbd-dev-leds: Free actual FbdDevLed as well.
    So far we only unref'ed the device.
  * fbd-dev-leds: Don't leak enum_name
    g_enum_to_string() is transfer full.
  * fbd-dev-leds: Don't leak color
    g_ascii_strdown() creates a copy already.
  * fbd-dev-leds: Use automatic deep cleanup for device list.
    The current logic was fragile and failed e.g. when the
    FEEDBACKD_UDEV_VAL_LED would not match leaking the dev since
    the g_object_unref() at the end of the loop was never hit.
    Prevent that with automatic cleanup and explicitly ref'ing the
    devs we want to use.
  * fbd-dev-sound: Use correct cleanup for hash table.
    This went unnoticed since the manager forgot to cleanup
    this at all (see follow up commit).
  * fbd-feedback-manager: Make sure to dispose sound device as
    well. Fixes another leak.
  * fbd-feedback-manager: Don't leak config_path. It's assigned
    multiple times.
  * fbd-feedback-manager: Don't leak device list
  * fbd-ledctrl: fix matching of trigger in list of triggers.
    If the trigger is the last thing in
    sysfs_path/LED_TRIGGER_ATTR, then the new-line at the end of
    the output causes g_strv_contains to fail to find the trigger
    in the list. This strips the new-line before splitting the
    output into a list for searching.
  * README: Fix gdbus test command. It is TriggerFeedback and not
    Feedback (anymore). Also add a note how to end the feedback in
    order to prevent loss of hearing :-).
- Switch to buildtime tarball generation, use cpio format. Also
  switch to a explicit released tag, we like to know what we are
  getting is the same every time. At the same strip v prefix from
  version in upstream tag.
- Split out shared library and typelib in separate packages, and
  name them after their soname and typelibname, follow the SLPP!
- Drop unneeded systemd-devel BuildRequires and
  sound-theme-freedesktop Requires.
- Replace gcc with generic c_compiler BuildRequires.
