  <title>Framework for Audio/Video Conferencing Protocols</title>
  <description>The Farsight project is an effort to create a framework to deal with
all known audio/video conferencing protocols. On one side it offers a
generic API that makes it possible to write plugins for different
streaming protocols, on the other side it offers an API for clients to
use those plugins.
