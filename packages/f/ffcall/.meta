  <title>Libraries for foreign function call interfaces</title>
  <description>This is a collection of four libraries which can be used to build foreign function call interfaces in embedded interpreters.  The four packages are:
 - avcall: calling C functions with variable arguments
 - vacall: C functions accepting variable argument prototypes
 - trampoline: closures as first-class C functions
 - callback: closures with variable arguments as first-class C functions  (a reentrant combination of vacall and trampoline)
