-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jul  1 10:06:36 UTC 2018 - tbechtold@suse.com

- Add "BuildRequires pkgconfig(yaml-0.1)" in flatpak-builder.spec
  to enable yaml manifest file support. This is needed to build
  flatpaks when flatpak manifest files are written in yaml (instead
  of json).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May  2 05:54:26 UTC 2018 - bjorn.lie@gmail.com

- Update to version 0.10.10:
  + We now support yaml manifest as well as json.
  + New source type "svn" to download subversion checkouts.
  + New source type "dir" for local directories.
  + Set FLATPAK_BUILDER_N_JOBS in environment during build.
  + If not using ccache, enforce it of. This helps builds with
    meson as they pick up ccache by default, which makes no
    sense when there is no persistent storage for ccache to use.
  + New options prepend--path similar to the existing append--path
    ones, but prepending instead.
  + New argument --no-shallow-clone which disables any shallow
    clone optimizations.
  + New inherit-sdk-extensions property similar to
    inherit-extensions, but is not inherited in the platform.
  + We now ignore json keys starting with "//" and "__" allowing
    these to be used for comments.
  + Fixed a bug that caused --install to not work properly.
  + New argument --extension-tag for using the new tagged extension
    feature.
  + The build metadata now records which extensions were produced
    as part of a build.
  + New property add-build-extensions allows creating exension
    points that can be used during the build.
  + flatpak-builder --run now also binds /run/build-runtime to the
    builds, allowing it to work when building runtimes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar  5 16:25:40 UTC 2018 - fcrozat@suse.com

  + Fix build on recent glibc.
- Changes from version 0.10.7:

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec 20 11:06:23 UTC 2017 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 0.10.6:
  + New checksum types for file/archive sources: md5, sha1, sha512.
  + Support including source snippets from another file, similar to
    how module includes are supported.
  + The app id renaming in the appdata file is now more careful to
    avoid renaming other parts.
  + The cache default repo format for new caches is now
    bare-user-only which means building with flatpak-builder works
    on filesystems that don't support xattrs.
  + New --install argument will install the finished build using
    the new flatpak install install-directly-from-local-repo
    feature. This makes it easier to test local builds.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov 27 09:16:01 UTC 2017 - adrien.plazas@suse.com

- Update to version 0.10.5:
  + Add support for running tests during the build (disable with
    --disable-tests).
  + New build-option append-pkg-config to append to
    PKG_CONFIG_PATH.
  + --state-dir option lets you reuse a single directory instead of
    scattered .flatpak-builder dirs for builds, downloads and cache
    data.
  + git: Allow updates with non-fastforwarded branched.
  + Don't fail if app ships both appdata and metainfo file.
  + Support --log-system/session-bus in --run.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov 02 10:30:15 UTC 2017 - aplazas@suse.com

- Update to version 0.10.3:
  + Yet more fixed or older versions of git. In particular, we
    disable fsck during transfer when doing a shallow clone and the
    git version is less than 1.8.3.2.
- Changes from version 0.10.2:
  + Even more fixes for shallow git clones with older versions of
    git.
  + New property for git sources, disable-shallow-clone which falls
    back to cloning the entire remote.
- Changes from version 0.10.1:
  + Fix handling of shallow git clones with older versions of git.
  + Fix issue where flatpak-builder --run could exit if some thread
    in the parent process exited, exposeb by e.g. gnome-builder.
- Changes from version 0.10.0:
  + We now do shallow clones of git repos when downloading if
    possible.
  + The way the cache works internally was slightly tweaked which
    will cause all existing caches to be rebuilt.
- Changes from version 0.9.99:
  + Fix git source bundling on older git version.
  + New property: appdata-license lets you easily modify the
    appstream license field.
  + New source type "extra-data" which makes it easier to use
    extra-data apps.
  + We now automatically compress debuginfo unless the
    no-debuginfo-compression option is specified.
  + Appstream files called .metainfo.xml are now recognized.
  + New prepare-platform-commands property, similar
    to cleanup-platform-commands, but run before importing all the
    changes from the SDK.
  + We now apply all the deletions that happened in the SDK on the
    base when creating the platform.
- Changes from version 0.9.98:
  + build cache hits are now faster.
  + git sources have a new property "tag" which works the same as
    "branch", but improves readability when referencing a git tag.
  + flatpak-builder --run now passes --with-appdir which is useful
    when testing uninstalled builds.
  + When bundling git repos in .Sources we now make a shallow clone
    which uses a lot less space.
  + .Locale extensions now always set the new locale-subset
    property.
  + locale-subset is supported in the add-extension property.
  + build-options now also supports make-args and make-install
    args, which allows per-arch make flags.
- Bump pkgconfig(flatpak) BuildRequires to 0.10.0.
- Bump pkgconfig(ostree-1) BuildRequires to 2017.12.
