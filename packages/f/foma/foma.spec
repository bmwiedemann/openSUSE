%description
Foma is a compiler, programming language, and C library for constructing
finite-state automata and transducers for various uses. It has specific
support for many natural language processing applications such as producing
morphological analyzers. Although NLP applications are probably the main
use of foma, it is sufficiently generic to use for a large number of purposes.

%package -n %{libname}
Summary:        Finite-state C library

%description -n %{libname}
The library contains efficient implementations of all classical
automata/transducer algorithms: determinization, minimization,
epsilon-removal, composition, boolean operations. Also, more
advanced construction methods are available: context restriction,
quotients, first-order regular logic, transducers from replacement
rules, etc.
