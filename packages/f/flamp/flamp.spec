%description
FLAMP is a program for AMP or Amateur Multicast Protocol. An FLAMP session will
transmit one or more files with one or more iterations of the transmission. Each
file is broken into blocks, each of which has a check sum. The receiving station
saves the blocks that pass check sum. Successive transmissions will fill in the
missing blocks provided that the new blocks pass the check sum. After the
transmission sequence, the entire file is assembled and may be saved. “Fills”
may be provided by retransmitting the entire file or by the sending station
only sending the missing blocks.
