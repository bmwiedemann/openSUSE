  <title>F3 (Fight Flash Fraud / Fight Fake Flash)</title>
  <description>This package contains tools for identifying fake flash drives (primarily USB
sticks and memory cards).

A fake flash drive fraudulently inflates its apparent storage capacity (far)
beyond the physical capacity of its flash memory. Not surprisingly, using such
a flash drive will, sooner or later, result in data loss and/or corruption.

The main tools in this package are an open-source implementation of the H2testw
algorithm. Some experimental tools are also provided, among them one for using
the actual storage capacity of fake drives as safely as possible.
