Wed May 20 09:51:47 UTC 2020 - Paolo Stivanin <info@paolostivanin.com>

  * Features
    - Add new --owner [user][:group] command-line option
    - Add support for a global ignore file (~/.config/fd/ignore on Unix)
    - Do not exit immediately if one of the search paths is missing
  * Bugfixes

      Windows terminals (see below) in order to support
      older Windows versions again
    - Fix --glob behavior with empty pattern

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 16 10:56:42 UTC 2020 - Martin Rey <mrey@suse.com>

- Update to 8.0.0
  * Features
    - Add a new -l/--list-details option to show more details about
      the search results.
    - Add a new --max-results=<count> option to limit the number of
      search results, see #472, #476 and #555
    - Add the alias -1 for --max-results=1, see #561.
    - Add new --type socket and --type pipe filters, see #511.
    - Add new --min-depth <depth> and --exact-depth <depth> options
      in addition to the existing option to limit the maximum
      depth. See #404.
    - Support additional ANSI font styles in LS_COLORS: faint, slow
      blink, rapid blink, dimmed, hidden and strikethrough.
  * Bugfixes
    - Preserve non-UTF8 filenames: invalid UTF-8 filenames are now
      properly passed to child-processes when using --exec,
      --exec-batch or --list-details. In fd's output, we replace
      non-UTF-8 sequences with the "�" character. However, if the
      output of fd goes to another process, we print the actual
      bytes of the filename. For more details, see #558 and #295.
    - LS_COLORS entries with unsupported font styles are not
      completely ignored, see #552
  * Changes
    - When using --glob in combination with --full-path, a *
      character does not match a path separation character (/ or
      \\) anymore. You can use ** for that. This allows things like
      fd -p -g '/some/base/path/*/*/*.txt' which would previously
      match to arbitrary depths (instead of exactly two folders
      below /some/base/path. See #404.
    - "Legacy" support to use fd -exec (with a single dash) has
      been removed. Use fd -x or fd --exec instead.
    - Overall improved error handling and error messages.
  * Other
    - Korean translation of the README, see: 한국어

- Changes from 7.5.0
  * Features
    - Added --one-file-system (aliases: --mount, --xdev) to not
      cross file system boundaries on Unix and Windows, see #507
    - Added --base-directory to change the working directory in
      which fd is run, see #509 and #475
    - fd will not use colored output if the NO_COLOR environment
      variable is set, see #550 and #551
    - fd --exec will return exit code 1 if one of the executed
      commands fails, see #526 and #531
  * Bug Fixes
    - Fixed 'command not found' error when using zsh completion,
      see #487
    - fd -L should include broken symlinks, see #357 and #497
    - Display directories even if we don't have permission to
      enter, see #437
  * Changes
    - A flag can now be passed multiple times without producing an
      error, see #488 and #496
    - Search results are sorted when using the -X option to match
      the behaviour of piping to xargs, see #441 and #524

  * When fd is run with the --exec-batch/-X option, it now exposes
    the exit status of the command that was run

    two new options --changed-before <date|duration> and --changed-within <..>.
    For more details, see the --help text, the man page,
    the relevant issue #165 and the PR #339 (@kimsnj)
  * Added --show-errors option to enable the display of filesystem error messages
    such as "permission denied", see #311 (@psinghal20 and @majecty)
