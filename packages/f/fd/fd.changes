- Update to version 8.5.0:
 - Features
  - --type executable/-t now works on Windows, see #1051 and #1061
 - Bugfixes
  - Fixed differences between piped / non-piped output. This changes fds behavior back to what we
  - had before 8.3.0, i.e. there will be no leading ./ prefixes, unless --exec/-x,
  - --exec-batch/-X, or --print0/-0 are used. --strip-cwd-prefix can be used to strip that
  - prefix in those cases. See #1046, #1115, and #1121
  - fd could previously crash with a panic due to a race condition in Rusts standard library
  - (see rust-lang/rust#39364). This has been fixed by switching to a different
  - message passing implementation, see #1060 and #1146
  - fds memory usage will not grow unboundedly on huge directory trees, see #1146
  - fd returns an error when current working directory does not exist while a search path is
  - specified, see #1072
  - Improved "command not found" error message, see #1083 and #1109
  - Preserve command exit codes when using --exec-batch, see #1136 and #1137
 - Changes
  - No leading ./ prefix for non-interactive results, see above.
  - fd now colorizes paths in parallel, significantly improving performance, see #1148
  - fd can now avoid stat syscalls even when colorizing paths, as long as the color scheme doesn't
  - require metadata, see #1148
  - The statically linked musl versions of fd now use jmalloc, leading to a significant performance
  - improvement, see #1062
 - Other
  - Added link back to GitHub in man page and --help text, see #1086
  - Major update in how fd handles command line options internally, see #1067

- Update to 8.2.1
  * No functional changes with respect to v8.2.0. Bugfix in the release process.

- Update to 8.2.0
  * Features
    - Add new `--prune` flag, see #535 (@reima)
    - Improved the usability of the time-based options, see #624 and #645 (@gorogoroumaru)
    - Add support for exact file sizes in the `--size` filter, see #669 and #696 (@Rogach)
    - `fd` now prints an error message if the search pattern requires a leading dot but
      `--hidden` is not enabled (Unix only), see #615
  * Bugfixes
    - Avoid panic when performing limited searches in directories with restricted permissions, see #678
    - Invalid numeric command-line arguments are silently ignored, see #675
    - Disable jemalloc on Android, see #662
    - The `--help` text will be colorless if `NO_COLOR` has been set, see #600 (@xanonid)
  * Changes
    - If `LS_COLORS` is not set (e.g. on Windows), we now provide a more comprehensive default which
      includes much more filetypes, see #604 and #682 (mjsir911).
  * Other
    - Added `zsh` completion files, see #654 and #189 (@smancill)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul 28 09:03:50 UTC 2020 - Martin Rey <mrey@suse.com>

- Update to 8.1.1
  * Bugfixes
    - Support colored output on older Windows versions if either
      (1) --color=always is set or
      (2) the TERM environment variable is set. See #469 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 20 09:51:47 UTC 2020 - Paolo Stivanin <info@paolostivanin.com>

- Update to 8.1.0
  * Features
    - Add new --owner [user][:group] command-line option
    - Add support for a global ignore file (~/.config/fd/ignore on Unix)
    - Do not exit immediately if one of the search paths is missing
  * Bugfixes
    - Reverted a change from fd 8.0 that enabled colors on all
      Windows terminals (see below) in order to support
      older Windows versions again
    - Fix --glob behavior with empty pattern

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 16 10:56:42 UTC 2020 - Martin Rey <mrey@suse.com>

- Update to 8.0.0
  * Features
    - Add a new -l/--list-details option to show more details about
      the search results.
    - Add a new --max-results=<count> option to limit the number of
      search results, see #472, #476 and #555
    - Add the alias -1 for --max-results=1, see #561.
    - Add new --type socket and --type pipe filters, see #511.
    - Add new --min-depth <depth> and --exact-depth <depth> options
      in addition to the existing option to limit the maximum
      depth. See #404.
    - Support additional ANSI font styles in LS_COLORS: faint, slow
      blink, rapid blink, dimmed, hidden and strikethrough.
  * Bugfixes
    - Preserve non-UTF8 filenames: invalid UTF-8 filenames are now
      properly passed to child-processes when using --exec,
      --exec-batch or --list-details. In fd's output, we replace
      non-UTF-8 sequences with the "ï¿½" character. However, if the
      output of fd goes to another process, we print the actual
      bytes of the filename. For more details, see #558 and #295.
    - LS_COLORS entries with unsupported font styles are not
      completely ignored, see #552
  * Changes
    - When using --glob in combination with --full-path, a *
      character does not match a path separation character (/ or
      \\) anymore. You can use ** for that. This allows things like
      fd -p -g '/some/base/path/*/*/*.txt' which would previously
      match to arbitrary depths (instead of exactly two folders
      below /some/base/path. See #404.
    - "Legacy" support to use fd -exec (with a single dash) has
      been removed. Use fd -x or fd --exec instead.
    - Overall improved error handling and error messages.
  * Other
    - Korean translation of the README, see: íêµ­ì´

- Changes from 7.5.0
  * Features
    - Added --one-file-system (aliases: --mount, --xdev) to not
      cross file system boundaries on Unix and Windows, see #507
    - Added --base-directory to change the working directory in
      which fd is run, see #509 and #475
    - fd will not use colored output if the NO_COLOR environment
      variable is set, see #550 and #551
    - fd --exec will return exit code 1 if one of the executed
      commands fails, see #526 and #531
  * Bug Fixes
    - Fixed 'command not found' error when using zsh completion,
      see #487
    - fd -L should include broken symlinks, see #357 and #497
    - Display directories even if we don't have permission to
      enter, see #437
  * Changes
    - A flag can now be passed multiple times without producing an
      error, see #488 and #496
    - Search results are sorted when using the -X option to match
      the behaviour of piping to xargs, see #441 and #524

    two new options --changed-before <date|duration> and --changed-within <..>.
