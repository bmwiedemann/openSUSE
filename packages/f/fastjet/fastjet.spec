%description
FastJet is a software package for jet finding in pp and e+e-
collisions. It includes fast native implementations of many sequential
recombination clustering algorithms, plugins for access to a range of
cone jet finders and tools for advanced jet manipulation.

It provides a fast implementation of several
longitudinally invariant sequential recombination jet algorithms, in
particular the longitudinally invariant kt jet algorithm, the
inclusive longitudinally invariant version of the Cambridge/Aachen
jet-algorithm, and the inclusive anti-kt algorithm.
