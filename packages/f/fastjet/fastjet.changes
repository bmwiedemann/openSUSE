- Update to version 3.2.1:
  * Added a missing assignment operator for ClusterSequence.
  * Eliminated a warning about unused variables when assertions
    are disabled.
  * Included SISCone-3.0.3 which now installs config.h to improve
    build stability.
- Changes from version 3.2.0:
  * Exposed the N2Plain and N2Tiled strategies for 3rd-party
    clustering algorithms under the form of two new classes
    (NNFJN2Plain and NNFJN2Tiled), similar to NNH.
  * Included version 3.0.2 SISCone with minor bug fixes.
  * Made template implementation of
    PseudoJet::obj_sorted_by_values() public.
  * Added a --guess-prefix option to fastjet-config (guesses
    prefix from location of fastjet-config instead of prefix from
    configure).
  * Added a --disable-auto-ptr option to configure.
  * Added internal helpers for C++11 and C++14 features:
    compile-time deprecation and the override keyword.

- Update to version 3.1.3
  * disables JetDefinition::operator(...) when CINT is detected, for
    ROOT v5 compatibility
  * works around an issue with recent versions of CGAL and the clang
    compiler 
- Changes from version 3.1.2
  * fixes a rounding error issue in the "lazy" clustering strategies 
    that, in rare cases, caused infinite loops or crashes
  * adds a check on clustering's internal consistency; a failure will 
    throw a new "InternalError" exception (derived from Error)
  * fixes a bug in the extraction of the fjcore code that resulted in
    fjcore failing for high multiplicities (~1000). This issue only 
    affects fjcore, not the full fastjet library
