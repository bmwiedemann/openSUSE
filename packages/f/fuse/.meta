  <title>User space File System</title>
  <description>With FUSE, a user space program can export a file system through the
kernel-default (Linux kernel).

User space file systems which are implemented using FUSE are provided
by the following packages:

- curlftpfs (mount FTP servers),

- encfs (layered file encryption),

- fuseiso (mount iso, img, bin, mdf and nrg CD-ROM images),

- fusepod (mount iPods),

- fusesmb (mount a fully browseable network neighborhood),

- gphotofs (mount gphoto-supported cameras),

- ntfs-3g (mount NTFS volumes read-write),

- obexfs (mount of bluetooth devices),

- sshfs (mount over ssh),

- wdfs (mount of WebDAV shares)

This package contains the mount binaries for fuse (might not be needed
by some FUSE filesystems like ntfs-3g) and the documentation for FUSE.

After installing fuse-devel, administrators can compile and install
other user space file systems which can be found at
