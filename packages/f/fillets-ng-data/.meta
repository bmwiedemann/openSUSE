  <title>Game Data for Fish Fillets - Next Generation</title>
  <description>Fish Fillets is strictly a puzzle game. The goal in each of the 70
levels is always the same: to find a safe way out. The fish utter witty
remarks about their surroundings and the various inhabitants of their
underwater realm quarrel among themselves or comment on the efforts of
your fish. The whole game is accompanied by quiet, comforting music.

This package contains data for the game.</description>
