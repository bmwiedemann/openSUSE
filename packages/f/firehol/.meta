  <title>Tools to build stateful firewalls and traffic shaping</title>
  <description>FireHOL is a language (and a program to run it) which builds stateful firewalls
from human-readable configuration files.

FireQOS is a program which sets up traffic shaping from human-readable
configuration files.

Both programs abstract away the differences between IPv4 and IPv6, and rules
for each protocol can be applied as needed.</description>
