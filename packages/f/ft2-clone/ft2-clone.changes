Tue Apr  9 17:41:44 UTC 2024 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 1.81
  * Rewrote some of the MIDI init/close code, as it looked like
    it could be buggy.
- Update to version 1.80
  * Doing note transpose on the whole song wouldn't count
    overflowing notes properly (it would sometimes not show a
    warning message first)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 18 17:09:25 UTC 2024 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 1.79
  * Fullscreen mode code has been refactored, as I apparently had
    coded it the wrong way. "Stretched" mode always fills the
    whole screen now too, and other issues may have been fixed as
    well.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Mar 17 23:15:33 UTC 2024 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 1.78
  * Fixed: It was possible to deadlock the tracker by attempting
    to load samples that had a filesize of zero bytes, or if the
    sample was in use by another program.
  * Fullscreen mode has received more bugfixes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Mar 17 12:19:41 UTC 2024 - Dirk MÃ¼ller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.77.1:
  * The 32-point sinc resampling interpolator was reduced to
    16-point again because of the trade-off not being big enough,
    and it was slightly wrongly implemented and would alias a
    little bit in some cases. I'll implement a better sinc
    interpolator in the future, if I ever stumble across a nice
    and simple implementation. Please let me know if you have
    one!

- Update to version 1.77
  * The 32-point sinc resampling interpolator was reduced to
    16-point again because of the trade-off not being big enough,
    and it was slightly wrongly implemented and would alias a
    little bit in some cases. I'll implement a better sinc
    interpolator in the future, if I ever stumble across a nice
    and simple implementation.

Fri Feb 23 21:04:00 UTC 2024 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 1.76
  * The 16-point sinc resampling interpolator has been upgraded to
    32-point for better sound quality in the tracker (if you have
    selected "Sinc (32 point)"). This interpolator is so good that
    a lot of old XM tunes will sound muddy because of lo-fi samples
    I recommend that you experiment with the choice of
    interpolators. "Cubic spline" is a good choice if you listen
    to a wide variety of XMs, while "Sinc (32 point)" is the best
    option if you create your own tunes using hi-fi samples, or if
    you mostly listen to XMs with hi-fi samples (or if you can
    accept a muddy/filtered sound from lo-fi samples).
  * Removed text fading from "about screen" (more is less)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Feb 17 16:10:20 UTC 2024 - Andrea Manzini <andrea.manzini@suse.com>

- Update to version 1.75
  * Note transpose (block), instrument remapping (block), Cut Block (ALT+F3)
    and Copy Block (ALT+F4) had issues if you had made a block selection in
    the last channel/track in a pattern.
    Thanks to Roz for finding this and reporting it, and sorry to all the people
    who may have had this bug without knowing what was going on!

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Dec 16 19:23:29 UTC 2023 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 1.74
  * Added a cubic spline audio interpolation option.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 30 18:53:32 UTC 2023 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 1.73
  * Sample editor: Shift + mouse-wheel = scroll sample data view
- Update to version 1.72
  * Block Cut (ALT+F3) and Block Copy (ALT+F4) was broken in v1.70

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct  4 15:36:01 UTC 2023 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 1.71
  * CTRL+A/ALT+A keybindings were swapped.
- Update to version 1.70
  * Bugfix: Shrink Pattern ("Srnk.") could lead to a pattern
    length of 0.
  * Better variable sanitation for some pattern editing routines,
    may (?) prevent some rare crashes.
  * CTRL+F5 (Paste Pattern) had wrong button names in its
    message box when asking to adjust the pattern length after
    pasting.
  * Changed the above message box text to be easier to understand.
  * Removed audio dithering for 16-bit audio bit depth mode. It
    seemed to be wrongly implemented anyway.
  * Some small changes done to the about screen.
  * Code cleanup.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Aug 27 13:13:37 UTC 2023 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 1.69
  Bugfixes
  * The 'pattern expand' feature was heavily broken and would mess
    up the pattern data (and potentially crash the program).
  * The program crash message could overflow and not show the full
    text on some system
- Update to version 1.68
  * De-minimize window (if minimized) and set focus after
    drag n' drop of file.
- Update to version 1.67
  * The song-to-WAV export screen now defaults to the tracker's bit
    depth and audio rate. This was actually the behavior for
    earlier versions of the FT2 clone, but I decided to change it
    back.
  * The song-to-WAV exporter now allows rates up to 384kHz.
  * Alpha-based fade in for the about screen content.
  * Some small text string changes (config and song-to-WAV export
    screen)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Apr 15 10:35:38 UTC 2023 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 1.66
  * Added a 16 point sinc interpolation option (higher quality).
  * Changed some settings for the default configuration:
    1. Palette theme = Dark mode
    2. Scopes = Lined
       Note: Your existing configuration will not be changed!
  * Changed the layout a little in the Config section (Audio /
    "I/O Devices")
  * Removed the 192kHz audio output setting. This was a bit
    extreme to begin with. Note: You can still select this rate
    when exporting songs to WAV.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Mar  4 11:56:27 UTC 2023 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 1.65
  * Quick fix for volume ramp delta.
- Update to version 1.64
  * Increased number of precision bits for song BPM, playback time
    counter and audio->video syncing. This is a minor change and
    does very little in practice as the previous precision was
    already quite good.
  * Audio/video sync timestamps are reset every half an hour to
    prevent possible sync drifting after several hours of playing
    a song without a single song stop (resets timestamp) in-between
  * The HPC timers are reset every half an hour instead of every
    hour. Video (if no vsync) and the scopes use these timers.
  * Small code refactor for how the song is timed/ticked. Longer
    song-to-WAV renders may have a filesize change of a few bytes,
    but this is actually more correct.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb 14 21:42:47 UTC 2023 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 1.63
- Build with system-wide flac
- Use pkg-config style dependencies

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Oct  9 14:04:02 UTC 2021 - Arachnos

- Initial package with Fasttracker II clone v1.47
