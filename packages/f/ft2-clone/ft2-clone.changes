- Update to version 1.66
  * Added a 16 point sinc interpolation option (higher quality).
  * Changed some settings for the default configuration:
    1. Palette theme = Dark mode
    2. Scopes = Lined
       Note: Your existing configuration will not be changed!
  * Changed the layout a little in the Config section (Audio /
    "I/O Devices")
  * Removed the 192kHz audio output setting. This was a bit
    extreme to begin with. Note: You can still select this rate
    when exporting songs to WAV.

- Update to version 1.65
  * Quick fix for volume ramp delta.
- Update to version 1.64
  * Increased number of precision bits for song BPM, playback time
    counter and audio->video syncing. This is a minor change and
    does very little in practice as the previous precision was
    already quite good.
  * Audio/video sync timestamps are reset every half an hour to
    prevent possible sync drifting after several hours of playing
    a song without a single song stop (resets timestamp) in-between
  * The HPC timers are reset every half an hour instead of every
    hour. Video (if no vsync) and the scopes use these timers.
  * Small code refactor for how the song is timed/ticked. Longer
    song-to-WAV renders may have a filesize change of a few bytes,
    but this is actually more correct.
