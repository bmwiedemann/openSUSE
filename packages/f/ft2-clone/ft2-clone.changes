Mon Oct 30 18:53:32 UTC 2023 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 1.73
  * Sample editor: Shift + mouse-wheel = scroll sample data view
- Update to version 1.72
  * Block Cut (ALT+F3) and Block Copy (ALT+F4) was broken in v1.70

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct  4 15:36:01 UTC 2023 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 1.71
  * CTRL+A/ALT+A keybindings were swapped.
- Update to version 1.70
  * Bugfix: Shrink Pattern ("Srnk.") could lead to a pattern
    length of 0.
  * Better variable sanitation for some pattern editing routines,
    may (?) prevent some rare crashes.
  * CTRL+F5 (Paste Pattern) had wrong button names in its
    message box when asking to adjust the pattern length after
    pasting.
  * Changed the above message box text to be easier to understand.
  * Removed audio dithering for 16-bit audio bit depth mode. It
    seemed to be wrongly implemented anyway.
  * Some small changes done to the about screen.
  * Code cleanup.

- Update to version 1.69
  Bugfixes
  * The 'pattern expand' feature was heavily broken and would mess
    up the pattern data (and potentially crash the program).
  * The program crash message could overflow and not show the full
    text on some system
- Update to version 1.68
  * De-minimize window (if minimized) and set focus after
    drag n' drop of file.
- Update to version 1.67
  * The song-to-WAV export screen now defaults to the tracker's bit
    depth and audio rate. This was actually the behavior for
    earlier versions of the FT2 clone, but I decided to change it
    back.
  * The song-to-WAV exporter now allows rates up to 384kHz.
  * Alpha-based fade in for the about screen content.
  * Some small text string changes (config and song-to-WAV export
    screen)

Sat Apr 15 10:35:38 UTC 2023 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 1.66
  * Added a 16 point sinc interpolation option (higher quality).
  * Changed some settings for the default configuration:
    1. Palette theme = Dark mode
    2. Scopes = Lined
       Note: Your existing configuration will not be changed!
  * Changed the layout a little in the Config section (Audio /
    "I/O Devices")
  * Removed the 192kHz audio output setting. This was a bit
    extreme to begin with. Note: You can still select this rate
    when exporting songs to WAV.

Sat Mar  4 11:56:27 UTC 2023 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 1.65
  * Quick fix for volume ramp delta.
- Update to version 1.64
  * Increased number of precision bits for song BPM, playback time
    counter and audio->video syncing. This is a minor change and
    does very little in practice as the previous precision was
    already quite good.
  * Audio/video sync timestamps are reset every half an hour to
    prevent possible sync drifting after several hours of playing
    a song without a single song stop (resets timestamp) in-between
  * The HPC timers are reset every half an hour instead of every
    hour. Video (if no vsync) and the scopes use these timers.
  * Small code refactor for how the song is timed/ticked. Longer
    song-to-WAV renders may have a filesize change of a few bytes,
    but this is actually more correct.

- Build with system-wide flac
