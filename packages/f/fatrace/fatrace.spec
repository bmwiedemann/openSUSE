%description
The fatrace trace uses fanotify, a couple of /proc lookups and some
glue to trace file access events system-wide, in an effort to
identify processes which keep waking up the disk even when the
computer is idle.

By default, it monitors the whole system, i.e. all mounts except
virtual ones like /proc, tmpfs, etc. It can be told to monitor just
the mount of the current directory. The log can be written to a file
and runtime be capped. Optional time stamps and PID filters are also
provided.
