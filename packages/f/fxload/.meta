  <title>Download Firmware into USB FX and FX2 Devices</title>
  <description>This program can download firmware into FX and FX2 EZ-USB devices as
well as the original AnchorChips EZ-USB.  It is intended to be invoked
by hotplug scripts when the unprogrammed device appears on the bus.

Primarily as an aid for developers, this can also be used to update
firmware on devices that boot from I2C serial EEPROMs.	For that use,
as well as downloading firmware to all other off-chip memory, a second
stage loader must first be downloaded.</description>
