    <comment>- Update to 0.9:
  * Added an option for the text tab size in terms of spaces.
  * Added &quot;To Upper Case&quot; and &quot;To Lower Case&quot;.
  * Disable the language button for documents that are made uneditable because of their contents.
  * Open the files of the last window instead of starting with all recent files (if the related option is checked).
  * Restore cursor positions with last window files too.
  * Remove the lock file only at the end, when the config is written, because writing may take some time with cursor positions.
  * Before focusing an existing side-pane with its toggling shortcut, ensure its visibility.
  * Added the overwrite mode, which is toggled by pressing the Insert key.
  * Added an option for saving unmodified files.
  * Added an option for closing a window on closing its last tab.
  * Fixed a regression in recognizing special files (started when QRegExp was replaced by QRegularExpression).
  * Added Ctrl+Up/Down for scrolling by one line without moving the cursor.
  * Added Meta+Up/Down for going to the same position in the previous/next unwrapped line.
  * Added shortcuts (Ctrl+Shift+Up/Down) for moving lines.
  * Added a history popup to the search bar.
  * Set the window title to the path.
  * Also open paths that point to nonexistent files (to save them later).
  * Don't show the warning bar when there's a modal dialog.
  * Added command-line options for cursor position.
  * Deal with relative paths completely.
  * Added an option to not permit opening of non-text files.
  * Added the number of pages to tab/side-item context menu.
  * Made Ctrl+Tab, Ctrl+Meta+Tab and Shift+Tab really align the text.
  * Covered regex inside QML too (with syntax highlighting).
  * Never remove trailing spaces with diff files.
  * Made highlighting of JavaScript regex faster and fixed some bugs in it.
  * Added an option for thick text cursor.
  * Made the current line number bold and added a marker for wrapped lines. Also made the line highlighter much milder.
  * Center the current line on clicking inside the line number strip.
  * Toggle side-pane by middle clicking an empty space inside it or inside the tab-bar.
  * Put the line number strip on the right with an RTL layout.
- Run spec-cleaner
- Delete _service file
- Remove desktop and icon cache update
- Update to 0.8:
  * Close the warning-bar when the text is scrolled.
  * Fixed highlighting and markdown.
  * Added the symlink &quot;fpad&quot;.
  * Added an options for auto-saving of opened files (disabled by default).
  * Add a new tab on double clicking an empty space of the tabbar.
  * An option for showing the cursor position on the statusbar (disabled by default).
  * Support syntax override (disabled by default).
  * An option for vertical position lines.
  * Open hyperlinks of highlighted texts by left-clikcing them while the Ctrl key is pressed and also with an item in the context menu.
  * Added an option for removing trailing spaces on saving (Markdown's trailing double spaces are taken care of).
  * Added Undo/Redo to custom shortcuts, although their default shortcuts are hard-coded in Qt.
  * Show whitespaces or line/document ends with normal texts too (by using the URL syntax highlighting).
  * Never show the horizontal scrollbar on wrapping (when whitespaces are visible).
  * Handle &quot;&amp;quot;&quot;, &quot;&amp;gt;&quot; and &quot;&amp;lt;&quot;, especially in XML.
  * Support hard-coded symbolic icons that change their colors appropriately (adapted from Cantata).
  * Bug fixes

  * A workaround is added for a new bug in KDE's file dialog.
  * Compilation without X11 is possible with qmake WITHOUT_X11=YES. Also, Haiku OS is supported.

  * Fix a regression in compilation without X11.
  * Fixes and improvements to syntax highlighting and support it with printing.
- Changes from 0.11.0:

  * Shift+Enter is made smarter, especially with numbered lists.
  * Better handling of typed custom shortcuts (including a workaround
    for a new Qt bug related to Meta key).

  *  The recent files feature can be disabled by setting its

    <user>dimstar_suse</user>
    <comment>- Update to 0.17.1:
  * Avoided making the cursor busy from a separate thread

- Update to 0.17.0:
  Main changes:
  * Now, FeatherPad can save as root without a root instance when
    the user doesn't have the permission to write. Polkit's
    pkexec is used (as a run-time dependency) for gaining the
    root privilege.
  * Printing is done in a separate thread, so that, if it takes
    a long time, other windows of FeatherPad could still be used.
  * Workarounds are added for bugs in Qt's default printing.
    Qt can't handle dark color schemes and the reverse order
    with printing; FeatherPad supports both.
  Other changes:
  * Made the warning bar more flexible for use with saving to
    root as well as printing.
  * Guarantee that the session dialog has focus after opening
    a session.
  * Added LaTex to the recognized syntaxes.
  * Added simple support for gvfs' admin.
  * Fixes to Perl syntax highlighting.
  * Several fixes to various small issues.</comment>

    versatile, and much more reliable, especially under
    extreme circumstances.
    FeatherPad still works under non-Linux systems without D-Bus,
    but as a multi-process app.
  * The qmake compilation has been removed. Its maintenance wasn't
    justified, especially with D-Bus.
  * A workaround has been added for a Qt5 bug that caused a crash
    if SIGTERM was sent while the replacement dock was visible.
    The bug doesn't exist in Qt6.</comment>

    <comment>- Update to 1.3.2:
  * The Unix signal handling is revamped.
  * Instant tab tooltips are replaced by ordinary ones under Wayland
    (because Wayland compositors have problem with instant tooltips
    of inactive windows).
  * Toml syntax highlighting is added.
  * The detection of legacy encodings has been totally removed with Qt6.</comment>

    <comment>- Update to 1.3.3:
  * A crash on pasting empty clipboard is fixed.
    The fix can be seen as a workaround because the root cause is in Qt.
  * Silenced the compilation warnings with Qt 6.4.
  * Covered indented here-docs in Bash and Perl syntax highlighting.</comment>

    <comment>- Update to 1.3.4:
  * A potential cause of crash is removed (by initializing the
    variables of TextEdit and TabBar before any event is triggered).
  * The Paste item of the Edit menu is enabled/disabled appropriately.
  * The single quote is covered as the digit separator in C++(≥14)
    syntax highlighting.
  * Enabled instant tooltips and corrected context menus on Wayland.</comment>

    <comment>- Update to 1.3.5:
  * Grouped files are always opened in a single window, even when
    the app is configured to open files in separate windows.
  * Tab DND is enabled under Wayland.
  * A total item deselection is prevented in the side-pane with
    Qt6 (Qt5 had no problem).
  * Side-pane and session buttons have been added to the tool-bar.</comment>
