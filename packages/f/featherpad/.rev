    <comment>- Update to 0.9:
  * Added an option for the text tab size in terms of spaces.
  * Added &quot;To Upper Case&quot; and &quot;To Lower Case&quot;.
  * Disable the language button for documents that are made uneditable because of their contents.
  * Open the files of the last window instead of starting with all recent files (if the related option is checked).
  * Restore cursor positions with last window files too.
  * Remove the lock file only at the end, when the config is written, because writing may take some time with cursor positions.
  * Before focusing an existing side-pane with its toggling shortcut, ensure its visibility.
  * Added the overwrite mode, which is toggled by pressing the Insert key.
  * Added an option for saving unmodified files.
  * Added an option for closing a window on closing its last tab.
  * Fixed a regression in recognizing special files (started when QRegExp was replaced by QRegularExpression).
  * Added Ctrl+Up/Down for scrolling by one line without moving the cursor.
  * Added Meta+Up/Down for going to the same position in the previous/next unwrapped line.
  * Added shortcuts (Ctrl+Shift+Up/Down) for moving lines.
  * Added a history popup to the search bar.
  * Set the window title to the path.
  * Also open paths that point to nonexistent files (to save them later).
  * Don't show the warning bar when there's a modal dialog.
  * Added command-line options for cursor position.
  * Deal with relative paths completely.
  * Added an option to not permit opening of non-text files.
  * Added the number of pages to tab/side-item context menu.
  * Made Ctrl+Tab, Ctrl+Meta+Tab and Shift+Tab really align the text.
  * Covered regex inside QML too (with syntax highlighting).
  * Never remove trailing spaces with diff files.
  * Made highlighting of JavaScript regex faster and fixed some bugs in it.
  * Added an option for thick text cursor.
  * Made the current line number bold and added a marker for wrapped lines. Also made the line highlighter much milder.
  * Center the current line on clicking inside the line number strip.
  * Toggle side-pane by middle clicking an empty space inside it or inside the tab-bar.
  * Put the line number strip on the right with an RTL layout.
- Run spec-cleaner
- Delete _service file
- Remove desktop and icon cache update
- Update to 0.8:
  * Close the warning-bar when the text is scrolled.
  * Fixed highlighting and markdown.
  * Added the symlink &quot;fpad&quot;.
  * Added an options for auto-saving of opened files (disabled by default).
  * Add a new tab on double clicking an empty space of the tabbar.
  * An option for showing the cursor position on the statusbar (disabled by default).
  * Support syntax override (disabled by default).
  * An option for vertical position lines.
  * Open hyperlinks of highlighted texts by left-clikcing them while the Ctrl key is pressed and also with an item in the context menu.
  * Added an option for removing trailing spaces on saving (Markdown's trailing double spaces are taken care of).
  * Added Undo/Redo to custom shortcuts, although their default shortcuts are hard-coded in Qt.
  * Show whitespaces or line/document ends with normal texts too (by using the URL syntax highlighting).
  * Never show the horizontal scrollbar on wrapping (when whitespaces are visible).
  * Handle &quot;&amp;quot;&quot;, &quot;&amp;gt;&quot; and &quot;&amp;lt;&quot;, especially in XML.
  * Support hard-coded symbolic icons that change their colors appropriately (adapted from Cantata).
  * Bug fixes
- update to version 0.7
- update to version 0.6.3

    <comment>- Update to 0.9.1:
  * The window title is set to the whole file path, including the file name.
  * The line number strip is enhanced.
  * Tab switch shortcuts can be customized now.
  * The warning bar is shown as a translucent layer over the tab widget with animation.
  * A shortcut is added for activating the last active tab.
  * &quot;gio&quot; is tried first for opening hyperlinks because Qt may resort to &quot;xdg-open&quot;, which isn't always a good choice.
  * A workaround is added for a new bug in KDE's file dialog.
  * Compilation without X11 is possible with qmake WITHOUT_X11=YES. Also, Haiku OS is supported.
  * Several fixes and improvements.</comment>

    <comment>- Update to 0.11.1:
  * Fix a regression in compilation without X11.
  * Fixes and improvements to syntax highlighting and support it with printing.
- Changes from 0.11.0:

    added to each dictionary and are saved in FeatherPad's config directory.
  * A new font dialog that distinguishes programming fonts from others.
  * Shift+Enter is made smarter, especially with numbered lists.
  * Better handling of typed custom shortcuts (including a workaround
    for a new Qt bug related to Meta key).
  * False warnings are prevented on startup.
  * Recent changes to settings won't be lost if the app is running on logout.
  * Native file dialogs are used by default.
  * The insert mode is also toggled by the keypad insert key.
  * Many fixes are made to Perl's syntax highlighting.
  * Deprecated Qt methods are replaced.</comment>
