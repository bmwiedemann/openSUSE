    <comment>- Update to 0.9:
  * Added an option for the text tab size in terms of spaces.
  * Added &quot;To Upper Case&quot; and &quot;To Lower Case&quot;.
  * Disable the language button for documents that are made uneditable because of their contents.
  * Open the files of the last window instead of starting with all recent files (if the related option is checked).
  * Restore cursor positions with last window files too.
  * Remove the lock file only at the end, when the config is written, because writing may take some time with cursor positions.
  * Before focusing an existing side-pane with its toggling shortcut, ensure its visibility.
  * Added the overwrite mode, which is toggled by pressing the Insert key.
  * Added an option for saving unmodified files.
  * Added an option for closing a window on closing its last tab.
  * Fixed a regression in recognizing special files (started when QRegExp was replaced by QRegularExpression).
  * Added Ctrl+Up/Down for scrolling by one line without moving the cursor.
  * Added Meta+Up/Down for going to the same position in the previous/next unwrapped line.
  * Added shortcuts (Ctrl+Shift+Up/Down) for moving lines.
  * Added a history popup to the search bar.
  * Set the window title to the path.
  * Also open paths that point to nonexistent files (to save them later).
  * Don't show the warning bar when there's a modal dialog.
  * Added command-line options for cursor position.
  * Deal with relative paths completely.
  * Added an option to not permit opening of non-text files.
  * Added the number of pages to tab/side-item context menu.
  * Made Ctrl+Tab, Ctrl+Meta+Tab and Shift+Tab really align the text.
  * Covered regex inside QML too (with syntax highlighting).
  * Never remove trailing spaces with diff files.
  * Made highlighting of JavaScript regex faster and fixed some bugs in it.
  * Added an option for thick text cursor.
  * Made the current line number bold and added a marker for wrapped lines. Also made the line highlighter much milder.
  * Center the current line on clicking inside the line number strip.
  * Toggle side-pane by middle clicking an empty space inside it or inside the tab-bar.
  * Put the line number strip on the right with an RTL layout.
- Run spec-cleaner
- Delete _service file
- Remove desktop and icon cache update
- Update to 0.8:
  * Close the warning-bar when the text is scrolled.
  * Fixed highlighting and markdown.
  * Added the symlink &quot;fpad&quot;.
  * Added an options for auto-saving of opened files (disabled by default).
  * Add a new tab on double clicking an empty space of the tabbar.
  * An option for showing the cursor position on the statusbar (disabled by default).
  * Support syntax override (disabled by default).
  * An option for vertical position lines.
  * Open hyperlinks of highlighted texts by left-clikcing them while the Ctrl key is pressed and also with an item in the context menu.
  * Added an option for removing trailing spaces on saving (Markdown's trailing double spaces are taken care of).
  * Added Undo/Redo to custom shortcuts, although their default shortcuts are hard-coded in Qt.
  * Show whitespaces or line/document ends with normal texts too (by using the URL syntax highlighting).
  * Never show the horizontal scrollbar on wrapping (when whitespaces are visible).
  * Handle &quot;&amp;quot;&quot;, &quot;&amp;gt;&quot; and &quot;&amp;lt;&quot;, especially in XML.
  * Support hard-coded symbolic icons that change their colors appropriately (adapted from Cantata).
  * Bug fixes

  * A workaround is added for a new bug in KDE's file dialog.
  * Compilation without X11 is possible with qmake WITHOUT_X11=YES. Also, Haiku OS is supported.

  * Fix a regression in compilation without X11.
  * Fixes and improvements to syntax highlighting and support it with printing.
- Changes from 0.11.0:

  * Shift+Enter is made smarter, especially with numbered lists.
  * Better handling of typed custom shortcuts (including a workaround
    for a new Qt bug related to Meta key).

  *  The recent files feature can be disabled by setting its

    <user>dimstar_suse</user>
    <comment>- Update to 0.17.1:
  * Avoided making the cursor busy from a separate thread

- Update to 0.17.0:
  Main changes:
  * Now, FeatherPad can save as root without a root instance when
    the user doesn't have the permission to write. Polkit's
    pkexec is used (as a run-time dependency) for gaining the
    root privilege.
  * Printing is done in a separate thread, so that, if it takes
    a long time, other windows of FeatherPad could still be used.
  * Workarounds are added for bugs in Qt's default printing.
    Qt can't handle dark color schemes and the reverse order
    with printing; FeatherPad supports both.
  Other changes:
  * Made the warning bar more flexible for use with saving to
    root as well as printing.
  * Guarantee that the session dialog has focus after opening
    a session.
  * Added LaTex to the recognized syntaxes.
  * Added simple support for gvfs' admin.
  * Fixes to Perl syntax highlighting.
  * Several fixes to various small issues.</comment>

    versatile, and much more reliable, especially under
    extreme circumstances.
    FeatherPad still works under non-Linux systems without D-Bus,
    but as a multi-process app.
  * The qmake compilation has been removed. Its maintenance wasn't
    justified, especially with D-Bus.
  * A workaround has been added for a Qt5 bug that caused a crash
    if SIGTERM was sent while the replacement dock was visible.
    The bug doesn't exist in Qt6.</comment>

  * The single quote is covered as the digit separator in C++(≥14)
    syntax highlighting.

    <comment>- Update to 1.5.0:
  * Removed Qt5 support. With this change, the legacy encodings are
	  also dropped because Qt6 does not support them. If you still have
    documents in legacy encodings, you could convert them to UTF-8
		with a tool like iconv.
  * Prevented the cursor position from being changed when files are
	  dragged and dropped into the text view.
  * Regex replacement with capturing groups is supported.
  * Fixed a rare issue in the geometry of a warning bar that is
	  animated during window resizing.
  * Miscellaneous small fixes and enhancements.</comment>
