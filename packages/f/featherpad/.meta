  <description>FeatherPad is a lightweight Qt5 plain-text editor for Linux. It is independent of any desktop environment and has:

* Drag-and-drop support, including tab detachment and attachment;
* X11 virtual desktop awareness (using tabs on current desktop but opening a new window on another);
* An optionally permanent search-bar with a different search entry for each tab;
* Instant highlighting of found matches when searching;
* A docked window for text replacement;
* Support for showing line numbers and jumping to a specific line;
* Automatic detection of text encoding as far as possible and optional saving with encoding;
* Syntax highlighting for common programming languages;
* Printing;
* Text zooming;
* Appropriate but non-interrupting prompts;
