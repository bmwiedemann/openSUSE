Mon Jan  9 08:10:57 UTC 2023 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

    the app is configured to open files in separate windows.
  * Tab DND is enabled under Wayland.
  * A total item deselection is prevented in the side-pane with
    Qt6 (Qt5 had no problem).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec  1 09:26:13 UTC 2022 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 1.3.4:
  * A potential cause of crash is removed (by initializing the
    variables of TextEdit and TabBar before any event is triggered).
  * The Paste item of the Edit menu is enabled/disabled appropriately.
  * The single quote is covered as the digit separator in C++(≥14)
    syntax highlighting.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Oct  8 08:31:18 UTC 2022 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep 13 05:45:04 UTC 2022 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 1.3.2:
  * The Unix signal handling is revamped.
  * Instant tab tooltips are replaced by ordinary ones under Wayland
    (because Wayland compositors have problem with instant tooltips
    of inactive windows).
  * Toml syntax highlighting is added.
  * The detection of legacy encodings has been totally removed with Qt6.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug  3 06:58:13 UTC 2022 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Updtae to 1.3.1:
  * D-Bus is used — instead of the old, network-based method — for
    making the app have a single process. D-Bus is faster, more
    versatile, and much more reliable, especially under
    extreme circumstances.
    FeatherPad still works under non-Linux systems without D-Bus,
    but as a multi-process app.
  * The qmake compilation has been removed. Its maintenance wasn't
    justified, especially with D-Bus.
  * A workaround has been added for a Qt5 bug that caused a crash
    if SIGTERM was sent while the replacement dock was visible.
    The bug doesn't exist in Qt6.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan  6 08:30:18 UTC 2021 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 0.17.0:
  Main changes:
  * Now, FeatherPad can save as root without a root instance when
    the user doesn't have the permission to write. Polkit's
    pkexec is used (as a run-time dependency) for gaining the
    root privilege.

    a long time, other windows of FeatherPad could still be used.
  * Workarounds are added for bugs in Qt's default printing.
    Qt can't handle dark color schemes and the reverse order
    with printing; FeatherPad supports both.

    root as well as printing.
  * Guarantee that the session dialog has focus after opening
    a session.
  * Added LaTex to the recognized syntaxes.

  *  The warning bar disappears when clicked or, automatically,
     after 10 seconds.
  *  "To Start Case" is added to the case changing actions.
  *  The 50-ms delay of format updating is removed because
     Qt's update requests seem appropriate now.
  *  Focus the editor's view with the Escape key.
  *  Current line highlight is made customizable.
  *  The recent files feature can be disabled by setting its
     number to zero.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 24 08:04:08 UTC 2020 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

    that are copied and pasted into FeatherPad (which is the

    JS highlighting).

  * A new font dialog that distinguishes programming fonts from others.
  * Shift+Enter is made smarter, especially with numbered lists.
