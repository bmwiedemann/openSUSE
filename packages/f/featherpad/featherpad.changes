Mon Feb 19 07:35:59 UTC 2024 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 1.5.0:
  * Removed Qt5 support. With this change, the legacy encodings are
	  also dropped because Qt6 does not support them. If you still have
    documents in legacy encodings, you could convert them to UTF-8
		with a tool like iconv.
  * Prevented the cursor position from being changed when files are
	  dragged and dropped into the text view.
  * Regex replacement with capturing groups is supported.
  * Fixed a rare issue in the geometry of a warning bar that is
	  animated during window resizing.
  * Miscellaneous small fixes and enhancements.

    highlighting is disabled.
  * Added an option for a small margin around the text.

    values of spin and combo boxes. Also, set their
  * to default when they're cleared.

  * Prevent window dragging from the line number strip.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr 18 11:25:32 UTC 2023 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

    incorrect translations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan  9 08:10:57 UTC 2023 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

    the app is configured to open files in separate windows.
  * Tab DND is enabled under Wayland.
  * A total item deselection is prevented in the side-pane with
    Qt6 (Qt5 had no problem).

Thu Dec  1 09:26:13 UTC 2022 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

  * The Paste item of the Edit menu is enabled/disabled appropriately.
  * The single quote is covered as the digit separator in C++(≥14)
    syntax highlighting.

  * Covered indented here-docs in Bash and Perl syntax highlighting.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep 13 05:45:04 UTC 2022 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 1.3.2:
  * The Unix signal handling is revamped.
  * Instant tab tooltips are replaced by ordinary ones under Wayland

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug  3 06:58:13 UTC 2022 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Updtae to 1.3.1:
  * D-Bus is used — instead of the old, network-based method — for
    making the app have a single process. D-Bus is faster, more
    versatile, and much more reliable, especially under
    extreme circumstances.
    FeatherPad still works under non-Linux systems without D-Bus,
    but as a multi-process app.
  * The qmake compilation has been removed. Its maintenance wasn't
    justified, especially with D-Bus.
  * A workaround has been added for a Qt5 bug that caused a crash
    if SIGTERM was sent while the replacement dock was visible.
    The bug doesn't exist in Qt6.

Wed Jan  6 08:30:18 UTC 2021 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 0.17.0:
  Main changes:
  * Now, FeatherPad can save as root without a root instance when
    the user doesn't have the permission to write. Polkit's
    pkexec is used (as a run-time dependency) for gaining the

    a long time, other windows of FeatherPad could still be used.

    with printing; FeatherPad supports both.

    root as well as printing.

  *  Current line highlight is made customizable.
  *  The recent files feature can be disabled by setting its
     number to zero.
