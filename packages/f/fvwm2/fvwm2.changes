  - dropped fvwm-icon-440d675d14412ec0a123d4c977534ab688229148.patch
  * New fvwm features:
    A new default configuration which is available when fvwm
    doesn't detect a configuration file to load.
    A new conditional command "Desk n" can restrict matching
    windows to a specific desk.
    A new conditional command "Screen n" to restrict matching
    windows on a given Xinerama screen.
    New expansion variable "w.screen" to ascertain the Xineram
    screen number a window is on.
    New command "InfoStoreClear" to remove all items in the
    InfoStore.
  * Removed features:
    The old and unmaintained debian/ and rpm/ directories have
    been removed; use the maintainers' copies where available.
    VMS support has been removed.
    GTK1.x support has been removed.
    GNOME-specific window hints (pre-EWMH) have been removed.
    Some fvwm modules have been removed:
      FvwmDragWell (no replacement)
      FvwmGTK (no replacement)
      FvwmSave (no replacement)
      FvwmSaveDesk (no replacement)
      FvwmScroll (no replacement)
      FvwmTabs (no replacement, never worked anyway)

  * New module features:
    FvwmButtons learned a new option "Colorset" to its
    ChangeButton command.
  * fvwm-menu-desktop updated:
    Renamed default menu to XDGMenu and changed the name
    of the FvwmForm to FvwmForm-XDGMenu-Config to not conflict
    with someone already using FvwmMenu.
    fvwm-menu-desktop will now load defaults from the
    FvwmForm-XDGMenu-Config data file.

    Added new options: --regen-cmd, --dynamic, and more.
  * Bug fixes:

    no longer loops infinitely.

  * Require default branding wallpaper package.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug  2 14:18:11 UTC 2016 - werner@suse.de

- Update to 2.6.6
  * fvwm features:
  - Support for Russian from Ivan Gayevskiy.
  - EnvMatch supports infostore variables.
  - The option "forget" to the Maximize command allows to
    unmaximize a window without changing its size and position.
  - Windows shaded to a corner (NW, NE, SW, SE) are reduced to a
    small square.
  - New option "!raise" to the WarpToWindow command.
  - The new extended variables $[wa.x], $[wa.y], $[wa.width],
    $[wa.height] can be used to get the geometry of the EWMH
    working area, and $[dwa.x], $[dwa.y], $[dwa.width],
    $[dwa.height] can be used to get the geometry of the EWMH
    dynamic working area.
  - The Resize commands accept "wa" or "da" as a suffix of the
    width or height value.  If present, the value is a percentage
    of the width or height of the EWMH working area or the EWMH
    dynamic working area.
  - Fvwm is much more resilient against applications that flood the
    window manager with repeated events.
  * New module features:
  - FvwmForm supports separator lines.
  - New FvwmIconMan options:
      IconAndSelectButton
      IconAndSelectColorset
  * Bug fixes:
  - Provide a wrapper for the deprecation of XKeycodeToKeysym and
    use XkbKeycodeToKeysym() where appropriate.
  - fvwm-menu-desktop is re-written and provides better support of
    the XDG menu specification.
  - Fix fvwm-menu-desktop keyError bug.  Use "others" if no desktop
    environment found.
  - FvwmIconMan had problems displaying the hilight colour on some
    systems (64 bit issue?).
  - Globally active windows cannot take the focus if the style
    forbids programs to take focus themselves (style
    !FPFocusByProgram).
  - Windows no longer jump from one position to the other which
    could happen in some cases with SnapAttraction.  Windows now
    snap to the closest window (or screen edge).
  - Removing bindings had several strange side effects that are
    fixed now (removing too many bindings; old bindings showing up
    again after another is removed; possibly other effects).
  - Windows sometimes did not get expose events (i.e. did not
    redraw properly) if they were uncovered by moving a window
    above them.  This has been fixed.
  - FvwmConsole now causes much less network traffic.
  - Suppress bogus events sent to the modules when a window is
    resized with the mouse.
  - Properly handle the has_ref_window_moved flag for ResizeMove and
    ResizeMoveMaximize.
  - Removed some unnecessary redraws in FvwmPager.
  - The option "NoDeskLimitY" option of the GotoPage command did
    not work.
  - Negative coordinates in the "rectangle" option to the Menu
    commend did not work correctly.  This has been fixed.
  - Removes a slight graphics problem whith the ResizeMaximize
    command being invoked from a window button menu.
  - When an attempt to reparent a client window (i.e. decorate
    it) fails, fvwm no longer throws away all events but only the
    events for that window.
  - The ChangeButton command of FvwmButtons used to strip
    whitespace from the beginning and end of button titles and
    image paths.  This is no longer done.
- Remove patches now upstream
   fvwm-2.6.5-eventcrash.patch
   fvwm-rsvg.patch
   fvwm-snapshot.patch
- Add upstream patch
   fvwm-icon-440d675d14412ec0a123d4c977534ab688229148.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep  3 17:15:36 CEST 2002 - mfabian@suse.de

- add fvwm-2.4.8-utf-8-font-load.patch.
  Thanks to Egbert Eich <eich@suse.de>
  Without this patch, fvwm2 doesn't work in UTF-8 locales.
  It writes many "internal error" messages about missing fonts
  to stdout and the menus are empty because the fonts couldn't
  be loaded. I.e. without this patch fvwm2 is unusable in UTF-8
  locales.

  (because susewm generates right config file system.fvwm2rc now)
- /etc/X11/fvwm2/system.fvwm2rc is right config file now

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr 24 08:31:47 CEST 2001 - pmladek@suse.cz
