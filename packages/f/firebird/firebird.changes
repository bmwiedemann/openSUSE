- update to upstream version 3.0.4
  * add support for SRP authentication using SHA-256
  * ODS (database file format) version raised to 12.2 on some
    architectures (including i586, not x86_64); new version will be
    able to open existing ODS 12.0 created on the same architecture
    but for database transfer between architectures, backup/restore
    is always recommended
  * context variables WIRE_COMPRESSED and WIRE_ENCRYPTED were added
    to the SYSTEM namespace to report compression and encryption
    status, respectively, of the current connection (CORE-5913)
  * enhanced reporting of errors when dynamic library fails to load
    (CORE-5908)
  * include funciton name when UDF causes "Arithmetic exception,
    numeric overflow, or string truncation" error (CORE-5876)
  * context variables LOCALTIME and LOCALTIMESTAMP (synonyms for
    CURRENT_TIME and CURRENT_TIMESTAMP) for compatibility with 4.0
    (CORE-5853)
  * read-only restriction for system tables was relaxed to permit
    CREATE, ALTER and DROP operations on their indexes (CORE-5746)
  * fix unauthorized BLOB access vulnerability (CORE-5801)
  * for a full list of bugfixes and improvements see

- replace unicode-handle-the-ICU-version-hack-from-SuSE.patch
  with more general upstream solution:
  * An-attempt-to-fix-CORE-5764-need-feedback-on-snapsho.patch
  * Fixed-a-code-somewhy-accepted-by-gcc6.patch
- unicode-handle-new-SUSE-ICU-version-hack.patch:

  upcoming ICU update (bsc#1095425)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 28 06:54:09 UTC 2018 - mkubecek@suse.cz

- move firebitd.xinetd back to firebird-server subpackage on SLE15
- provide /etc/xinetd.d directory on Tumbleweed and Leap 15.0 as
  xinetd is no longer guaranteed to be present there; this solution
  (suggested by Dimstar) is less painful than either having
  firebird-server depend on xinetd or splitting a new subpackage
  firebird-server-classic.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 23 11:32:28 UTC 2018 - mkubecek@suse.cz

- patch xinetd config file unconditionally; previous change would
  result in unpatched xinetd config file installed on Tumbleweed
  so that the service would be enabled by default and firebird
  binary run as root

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar 22 09:57:02 UTC 2018 - fcrozat@suse.com

- Do no ship xinetd file on SLE15 (bsc#1084459).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Mar  3 17:51:56 UTC 2018 - mkubecek@suse.cz

- update to upstream version 3.0.3

    constant must be recompiled
  * provide crypto key name via fb_info_crypt_key item in
    Attachment::getInfo()
  * improve handling of concurrent ALTER DATABASE statements
  * make sure ORDER BY with equivalent expressions are equivalent
    and use the same plan

    EXECUTE STATEMENT
  * show date and time of analysis in gstat output
  * show database info in sweep error message
  * provide compression details and encryption status of the
    connection in Attachment::getInfo() API call
  * fix RDB$RELATION_TYPE when restoring ODS < 11.1 database
  * the optimizer can now estimate the actual record compression
    ratio
  * various performance improvements
  * various bug fixes, for a list, see release notes at
    http://www.firebirdsql.org/file/documentation/release_notes/html/en/3_0/rnfb30-bug.html

- update to upstream version 3.0.2
  * allow to to filter out info and warnings from the trace log
  * enhance control capability when sharing the database crypt key
    between Superserver attachments
  * the physical numbers of frequently used data pages are now
    cached to reduce the number of fetches of pointer pages
  * in SuperServer mode, read-only transaction will no longer force
    write the Header\TIP page content to disk immediately after
    a change
  * make the database name available to an encryption plug-in

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun 29 07:33:19 UTC 2016 - mkubecek@suse.cz

- add fake "Provides: libfbembed-devel" to libfbclient-devel
  subpackage; this is a temporary workaround to allow LibreOffice
  build both before and after firebird is upgraded to verison 3.0
  in Factory; once FB3 is in Factory, LibreOffice BuildRequires
  can be updated to libfbclient-devel (based on %suse_version) and
  this hack can be dropped

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May 31 11:27:53 UTC 2016 - mkubecek@suse.cz

- move libEnginge12.so and intl/ into firebird package as these
  are also needed by embedded connections
- include /etc/firebird/firebird.conf.d/*.conf into configuration
- move the directive restricting DatabaseAccess to /srv/firebird
  into a separate config file in firebird-server subpackage so
  that it doesn't affect embedded-only installs
- do-not-use-DatabaseAccess-Full-in-default-config.patch:
  replaced by 50-server.conf
- fix Group tag for libfbclient2 and libib_util subpackages
- improve libib_util subpackage description

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 18 08:58:12 UTC 2016 - mkubecek@suse.cz

- libfbclient-devel cannot be used as a direct replacement for
  libfbembed-devel so it's better to stop pretending so
- some packages have (unnecessary) explicit build requirement for
  firebird-devel whose contents was merged into libfbclient-devel;
  add corresponding Provides and Obsoletes

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 11 23:30:43 UTC 2016 - mkubecek@suse.cz

- Fix-locking-on-big-endian-architectures.patch:
  fix broken code (and failed build) on big endian architectures
  (CORE-5232)

- delete add-experimental-support-for-m68k-architecture.patch
  architecture specific settings are managed in a different way
  in 3.0 so that this would need a complete rewrite; as this
  has little chance to get upstreamed and I doubt anyone plans
  to actually run Firebird 3.0 on openSUSE on m68k, let's just
  drop it

- update to upstream version 2.5.2.26539 (2.5.2 final)
  * Optimizer level solution for CORE-2790/CORE-3449
  * CORE-2666: Make it possible to use API to do remote
    backups/restores
  * backup state lock should be released at latch timeout, else
    lock state accounting becomes inconsistent
  * CORE-3873: Server crashes while switching to the shadow if the
    disk I/O fault happens while flushing the cache
  * CORE-3860: Trace API: Faulty database filter crashes server
  * CORE-3875: GBak does not check correctly parameters and backups
    random database with -B ":"
  * CORE-3879: Make fb_lock_print a bit more handy
  * CORE-3656: Support for sweep information in Trace API
  * CORE-2668: Write note into log when automatic sweep is started
  * Enabled per-table runtime stats for sweeper (necessary for
    CORE-3656)
  * CORE-3884: Server crashes on preparing empty query when trace
    is enabled
  * CORE-3238: Makes GEN_UUID return a compliant RFC-4122 binary
    UUID
  * CORE-3887: CHAR_TO_UUID and UUID_TO_CHAR works different in
    big/little endian architectures - problem similar to CORE-2898
  * CORE-3895: High memory usage when PSQL code SELECT's from
    stored procedure which modified some data
  * Fixed the server crash in Stack::assign()
  * CORE-3902: Derived fields may not be optimized via an index
  * Fixed the broken (working as no-op) sweep in SuperServer
  * Use better name from trunk for CORE-3911
  * Restored the ODS level compatibility with v2.5.1 index keys,
    while using the "old good" index key format in new indices. It
    allows to claim that CORE-3675 and CORE-3853 are fixed (after
    migration via backup/restore) but still operate almost
    correctly with keys created in v2.5.1.
  * CORE-3912: segfault in superclassic
  * Better diagnostic (CORE-3786)

  * Rolled back the ODS level solution for CORE-2709 as it causes
    cross-version compatibility issues (CORE-3853) as well as
    functional regressions (CORE-3675). Another solution is likely
    to be committed instead.
  * CORE-3769: The message 'Unknown tag (4) in isc_svc_query()
    results' appears when fbtracemgr is interrupted by Ctrl-C
