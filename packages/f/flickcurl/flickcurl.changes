- Update to 1.23 version:
  * Full support using Flickr via OAuth 1.0 and converting
    from the legacy Flickr authentication to OAuth. It supports both
    authentication flows but Flickr has deprecated the legacy
    authentication, so it might stop working at any time.

    OAuth 1.0. This revokes and deletes the legacy 'auth_token' and returns
    an OAuth Access Token and Access Token Secret pair which need to be
    saved.
