    <comment>- Fixed export of incorrect dependencies 'typelib(Adw)})'.
  Patch added foliate-fix-export-of-incorrect-dep-Adw.patch.
- Update to version 3.0.0
  * UI changes:
    - The library and the e-book viewer are unified in a single 
      window.
    - The library now loads more books as you scroll, no longer
      requiring clicks to load more items.
    - Table of contents, annotations, bookmarks are now in a sidebar,
      which is docked to the side by default, but can also be set 
      to be always folded (overlaid on top of content when revealed).
    - The &quot;Add Bookmark&quot; button is moved to the header bar, 
      and the page will show a ribbon when bookmarked.
    - Removed &quot;turn page on tap&quot;; use swiping instead.
    - Removed option for skeuomorphic shadows.
    - Removed experimental traditional titlebar option.
  * Book rendering:
    - It no longer loads the entire file into memory, 
      greatly reducing startup time and memory usage,
      and it no longer loads every item in the TOC,
      further improving startup time.
    - Reloading now properly reloads the file, rather than merely 
      re-rendering.
    - Mobipocket and Kindle files are no longer extracted on disk; 
      they are processed entirely in memory.
    - Mobipocket files are now divided into sections at 
      &lt;mbp:pagebreak&gt; tags, which greatly improves performance 
      as it no longer requires rendering the whole book at once. 
      Unfortunately this also means existing annotations for 
      this format will not be displayed correctly.
    - When a page is not valid XHTML, it will be processed as HTML.
    - It no longer tries to override fonts with CSS. Instead, 
      you can now configure the default serif, sans-serif, 
      and monospace fonts, as well as setting the minimum font size.
    - Added support for obfuscated fonts.
    - Added support for user stylesheet.
    - FB2: fixed infinite recursion bug (#935) and comments 
      are now correctly ignored.
    - Added experimental support for PDF files.
    - Removed support for CBR, CBT, and CB7 files 
      (CBZ is still supported).
  * Layout:
    - Paginated mode now has animation and 1:1 touchscreen 
      and touchpad swipe gestures.
    - Paginated mode supports more than two columns. 
      The number of columns is controlled by a maximum width 
      setting. As the window gets wider, it will add more columns 
      to prevent lines from getting too long.
    - Margins are now relative to the viewport size.
    - It is now possible to configure both max width and max height.
    - The page reflows faster when resizing, and reliably stays 
      at the same location without flashing.
    - Switching between paginated and scrolled layouts is faster 
      and can be done with a shortcut (Ctrl+M).
    - Removed continuous scrolling mode, as the new renderer does 
      not support it (yet).
  * Locations:
    - Locations are now calculated from raw byte size instead 
      of character count. The progress slider and reading time 
      estimates are available instantly when you first open a book,
      and locations are no longer cached. Old .json files in the
      cache directory can be deleted.
    - The progress slider now turns pages as you drag, 
      and can be used with keyboard and mouse wheel.
    - Page-list and landmarks are now supported and can be 
      accessed from the location popover.
  * Find in book:
    - Results are now shown in the sidebar.
    - Added option to ignore diacritics and to match whole words only.
    - Added shortcuts for going to next and previous matches 
      (Ctrl+G and Ctrl+Shift+G).
  * Image viewer:
    - Images are opened with double click by default; 
      removed options for single, right, and middle click.
    - Images are now copied and saved in their original format 
      (previously, they were always converted to PNG).
  * Narration:
    - Text-to-speech now uses Speech Dispatcher, 
      and supports pausing, skipping, word highlighting, 
      SSML, and speed and pitch controls.
    - Added support for EPUB Media Overlays.
  * Copying:
    - Selected text can now be copied with HTML formatting.
    - Added &quot;Copy with Citation&quot;, which adds the author and title 
      info to the copied text.
    - Added &quot;Copy Identifier&quot;, which copies the CFI of 
      the text fragment.
  * Security:
    - The WebView no longer has unlimited file access.
  * Other changes:
    - Added underline option for annotations.
    - Annotations are now saved with timestamps.
    - Added the ability to print chapters and selections.
    - WebKit's inspector is always enabled, and can be accessed 
      from the menu, or by pressing F12.
  * Added BuildRequires:
    - gtk4
    - libadwaita
    - webkitgtk-6.0
    - desktop-file-utils (forwarded request 1127202 from Dead_Mozay)</comment>
