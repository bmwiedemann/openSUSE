  <title>A universal flash programming utility</title>
  <description>flashrom is a utility for reading, writing, verifying and erasing flash ROM
chips. It's often used to flash BIOS/EFI/coreboot/firmware images in-system
using a supported mainboard, but it also supports flashing of network
cards (NICs), SATA controller cards, and other external devices which can
program flash chips.

It supports a wide range of DIP32, PLCC32, DIP8, SO8/SOIC8, TSOP32, and
TSOP40 chips, which use various protocols such as LPC, FWH, parallel flash,
or SPI.</description>
