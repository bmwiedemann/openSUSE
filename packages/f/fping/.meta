  <title>A Program to Ping Multiple Hosts</title>
  <description>FPing is a ping-like program that uses the Internet Control Message
Protocol (ICMP) echo request to determine if a target host is
responding. FPing differs from ping in that you can specify any number
of targets on the command line or specify a file containing a list of
targets to ping. Instead of sending pings to one target until it times
out or replies, FPing sends a ping packet and moves on to the next
target in a round-robin fashion.

In the default mode, if a target replies, it is noted and removed from
the list of targets to check. If a target does not respond within a
certain time limit or retry limit, it is designated as unreachable.
FPing also supports sending a specified number of pings to a target or
looping indefinitely (as in ping).

Unlike ping, FPing is meant to be used in scripts. Its output is
designed to be easy to parse.</description>
