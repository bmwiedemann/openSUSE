- Update to version 7.1.0
  * Switched from Grisu3 to Dragonbox for the default
    floating-point formatting which gives the shortest decimal
    representation with round-trip guarantee and correct rounding.
    This makes {fmt} up to 20-30x faster than common
    implementations of std::ostringstream and sprintf on
    dtoa-benchmark and faster than double-conversion and Ryū. It
    is possible to get even better performance at the cost of
    larger binary size by compiling with the
    FMT_USE_FULL_CACHE_DRAGONBOX macro set to 1.
  * Added an experimental unsynchronized file output API which,
    together with format string compilation can give 5-9 times
    speed up compared to fprintf on common platforms.
  * Added a formatter for std::chrono::time_point<system_clock>
  * Added support for ranges with non-const begin/end to fmt::join
  * Added a memory_buffer::append overload that takes a range.
  * Improved handling of single code units in FMT_COMPILE.
  * Added dynamic width support to format string compilation.
  * Improved error reporting for unformattable types: now you'll
    get the type name directly in the error message instead of
    the note.
  * Added the make_args_checked function template that allows
    you to write formatting functions with compile-time format
    string checks and avoid binary code bloat.
  * Replaced snprintf fallback with a faster internal IEEE 754
    float and double formatter for arbitrary precision.
  * Made format_to_n and formatted_size part of the core API.
  * Added fmt::format_to_n overload with format string
    compilation.
  * Added fmt::format_to overload that take text_style.
  * Made the # specifier emit trailing zeros in addition to the
    decimal point.
  * Changed the default floating point format to not include .0
    for consistency with std::format and std::to_chars. It is
    possible to get the decimal point and trailing zero with the
    # specifier.
  * Fixed an issue with floating-point formatting that could
    result in addition of a non-significant trailing zero in
    rare cases e.g. 1.00e-34 instead of 1.0e-34.
  * Made fmt::to_string fallback on ostream insertion operator
    if the formatter specialization is not provided.
  * Added support for the append mode to the experimental file
    API and improved fcntl.h detection.
  * Fixed handling of types that have both an implicit
    conversion operator and an overloaded ostream insertion
    operator.
  * Fixed a slicing issue in an internal iterator type.
  * Fixed an issue in locale-specific integer formatting.
  * Fixed handling of exotic code unit types.
  * Improved FMT_ALWAYS_INLINE.
  * Improved documentation.
  * Added the FMT_REDUCE_INT_INSTANTIATIONS CMake option that
    reduces the binary code size at the cost of some integer
    formatting performance. This can be useful for extremely
    memory-constrained embedded systems.
  * Added the FMT_USE_INLINE_NAMESPACES macro to control usage
    of inline namespaces.
  * Improved build configuration.
  * Fixed various warnings and compilation issues.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul  6 14:36:10 UTC 2020 - Luigi Baldoni <aloisio@gmx.com>

- Update to version 7.0.0
  * Reduced the library size.
  * Added a simpler and more efficient format string compilation
    API. The old fmt::compile API is now deprecated.
  * Optimized integer formatting: format_to with format string
    compilation and a stack-allocated buffer is now faster than
    to_chars on both libc++ and libstdc++.
  * Optimized handling of small format strings.
  * Applied extern templates to improve compile times when using
    the core API and fmt/format.h. It is still recommended to use
    fmt/core.h instead of fmt/format.h but the compile time
    difference is now smaller.
  * Named arguments are now stored on stack (no dynamic memory
    allocations) and the compiled code is more compact and
    efficient.
  * Implemented compile-time checks for dynamic width and
     precision.
  * Added sentinel support to fmt::join.
  * Added support for named args, clear and reserve to
    dynamic_format_arg_store.
  * Added support for the 'c' format specifier to integral types
    for compatibility with std::format.
  * Replaced the 'n' format specifier with 'L' for compatibility
    with std::format. The 'n' specifier can be enabled via the
    FMT_DEPRECATED_N_SPECIFIER macro.
  * The '=' format specifier is now disabled by default for
    compatibility with std::format. It can be enabled via the
    FMT_DEPRECATED_NUMERIC_ALIGN macro.
  * Removed the following deprecated APIs:
    + FMT_STRING_ALIAS and fmt macros - replaced by
      FMT_STRING
    + fmt::basic_string_view::char_type - replaced by
      fmt::basic_string_view::value_type
    + convert_to_int
    + format_arg_store::types
    + *parse_context - replaced by *format_parse_context
    + FMT_DEPRECATED_INCLUDE_OS
    + FMT_DEPRECATED_PERCENT - incompatible with
      std::format
    + *writer - replaced by compiled format API
  * Renamed the internal namespace to detail. The former is
    still provided as an alias if the FMT_USE_INTERNAL macro is
    defined.
  * Improved compatibility between fmt::printf with the standard
    specs.
  * Fixed handling of operator<< overloads that use copyfmt.
  * Added the FMT_OS CMake option to control inclusion of
    OS-specific APIs in the fmt target. This can be useful for
    embedded platforms.
  * Replaced FUZZING_BUILD_MODE_UNSAFE_FOR_PRODUCTION with the
    FMT_FUZZ macro to prevent interferring with fuzzing of
    projects using {fmt}.
  * Fixed compatibility with emscripten.
  * Improved documentation.
  * Implemented various build configuration fixes and
    improvements.
  * Fixed various warnings and compilation issues.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr  6 14:21:08 UTC 2020 - Luigi Baldoni <aloisio@gmx.com>

- Update to version 6.2.0
  * Improved error reporting when trying to format an object of
    a non-formattable type:
  * Reduced library size by ~10%.
  * Always print decimal point if # is specified (#1476, #1498):
  * Implemented the 'L' specifier for locale-specific numeric
    formatting to improve compatibility with std::format. The 'n'
    specifier is now deprecated and will be removed in the next
    major release.
  * Moved OS-specific APIs such as windows_error from
    fmt/format.h to fmt/os.h. You can define
    FMT_DEPRECATED_INCLUDE_OS to automatically include fmt/os.h from
    fmt/format.h for compatibility but this will be disabled in the
    next major release.
  * Added precision overflow detection in floating-point
    formatting.
  * Implemented detection of invalid use of fmt::arg.
  * Used type_identity to block unnecessary template argument
    deduction.
  * Improved UTF-8 handling (#1109):
  * Added experimental dynamic argument storage (#1170, #1584):
  * Made fmt::join accept initializer_list (#1591).
  * Fixed handling of empty tuples (#1588).

  * Added the ability to disable floating-point formatting via
    FMT_USE_FLOAT, FMT_USE_DOUBLE and FMT_USE_LONG_DOUBLE macros for
    extremely memory-constrained embedded system (#1590).
  * Made FMT_STRING work with constexpr string_view (#1589).
  * Implemented a minor optimization in the format string parser
    (#1560).
  * Improved attribute detection (#1469, #1475, #1576).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec  5 15:43:30 UTC 2019 - Luigi Baldoni <aloisio@gmx.com>

- Update to version 6.1.1
  * Added a missing decimal point in exponent notation with
    trailing zeros.
  * Removed deprecated format_arg_store::TYPES.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec  4 11:34:50 UTC 2019 - Luigi Baldoni <aloisio@gmx.com>

- Update to version 6.1.0
  * {fmt} now formats IEEE 754 ``float`` and ``double`` using
    the shortest decimal representation with correct rounding by
    default:
    .. code:: c++

       #include <cmath>
       #include <fmt/core.h>

       int main() {
         fmt::print("{}", M_PI);
       }

    prints ``3.141592653589793``.
  * Made the fast binary to decimal floating-point formatter the
    default, simplified it and improved performance. {fmt} is now
    15 times faster than libc++'s ``std::ostringstream``, 11
    times faster than ``printf`` and 10% faster than
    double-conversion on `dtoa-benchmark
    (https://github.com/fmtlib/dtoa-benchmark)

    ==================  =========  =======
    Function            Time (ns)  Speedup
    ==================  =========  =======
    ostringstream        1,346.30    1.00x
    ostrstream           1,195.74    1.13x
    sprintf                995.08    1.35x
    doubleconv              99.10   13.59x
    fmt                     88.34   15.24x
    ==================  =========  =======
  * {fmt} no longer converts ``float`` arguments to ``double``.
    In particular this improves the default (shortest)
    representation of floats and makes
    ``fmt::format`` consistent with ``std::format`` specs
    (#1336, #1353, #1360, #1361)
    .. code:: c++

       fmt::print("{}", 0.1f);

    prints ``0.1`` instead of ``0.10000000149011612``.
  * Made floating-point formatting output consistent with
    ``printf``/iostreams (#1376, #1417)
  * Added support for 128-bit integers (#1287)
    .. code:: c++

       fmt::print("{}", std::numeric_limits<__int128_t>::max());

    prints ``170141183460469231731687303715884105727``.
  * The overload of ``print`` that takes ``text_style`` is now
    atomic, i.e. the output from different threads doesn't
    interleave (#1351)
  * Made compile time in the header-only mode ~20% faster by
    reducing the number of template instantiations. ``wchar_t``
    overload of ``vprint`` was moved from
    ``fmt/core.h`` to ``fmt/format.h``.
  * Added an overload of ``fmt::join`` that works with tuples
    (#1322, #1330)
    .. code:: c++

       #include <tuple>
       #include <fmt/ranges.h>

       int main() {
         std::tuple<char, int, float> t{'a', 1, 2.0f};
         fmt::print("{}", t);
       }

    prints ``('a', 1, 2.0)``.
  * Changed formatting of octal zero with prefix from "0o0" to
    "0":
    .. code:: c++

       fmt::print("{:#o}", 0);

    prints ``0``.
  * The locale is now passed to ostream insertion (``<<``)
    operators (#1406)
    .. code:: c++

       #include <fmt/locale.h>
       #include <fmt/ostream.h>

       struct S {
         double value;
       };

       std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& os, S s) {
         return os << s.value;
       }

       int main() {
         auto s = fmt::format(std::locale("fr_FR.UTF-8"), "{}", S{0.42});
         // s == "0,42"
       }
  * Locale-specific number formatting now uses grouping (#1393,
    #1394)
  * Fixed handling of types with deleted implicit rvalue
    conversion to ``const char**`` (#1421)
    .. code:: c++

       struct mystring {
         operator const char*() const&;
         operator const char*() &;
         operator const char*() const&& = delete;
         operator const char*() && = delete;
       };
       mystring str;
       fmt::print("{}", str); // now compiles
  * Enums are now mapped to correct underlying types instead of
    ``int`` (#1286)
  * Enum classes are no longer implicitly converted to ``int``
    (#1424)
  * Added ``basic_format_parse_context`` for consistency with
    C++20 ``std::format`` and deprecated ``basic_parse_context``.
  * Fixed handling of UTF-8 in precision (#1389, #1390)
  * Added a CUDA test (#1285, #1317)
  * Improved documentation (#1276, #1291, #1296, #1315, #1332,
    #1337, #1395, #1418)
  * Various code improvements (#1358, #1407)
  * Fixed compile-time format string checks for user-defined
    types (#1292)
  * Worked around a false positive in
    ``unsigned-integer-overflow`` sanitizer (#1377)
  * Fixed various warnings and compilation issues (#1273, #1278,
    #1280, #1281, #1288, #1290, #1301, #1305, #1306, #1309,
    #1312, #1313, #1316, #1319, #1320, #1326, #1328, #1344,
    #1345, #1347, #1349, #1354, #1362, #1366, #1364, #1370,
    #1371, #1385, #1388, #1397, #1414, #1416, #1422, #1427,
    #1431, #1433)
