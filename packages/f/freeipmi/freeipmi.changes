  o Support Supermicro H8SGL-F OEM sensors and events.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct  4 08:32:38 UTC 2016 - kkaempf@suse.com

- Update to 1.5.4
  o Various changes/fixes in libipmiconsole
    - If user retrieves file descriptor from ipmiconsole_ctx_fd,
      user is required to close it.  ipmiconsole_ctx_destroy no
      longer closes it.  This is to avoid a potential double close
      which can be a problem for multithreaded applications. This
      is a change in behavior, but we do not believe this will
      affect most applications since most users close the file
      descriptor under most scenarios anyways.
    - ipmiconsole_ctx_destroy() should now be called to free
      resources even if ipmiconsole_engine_teardown() has been
      called.  This has been done to create consistent behavior in
      the API and avoid a former segfault possibility.  This is a
      change in behavior, but we do not believe this will affect
      most applications since ipmiconsole_engine_teardown() is
      only called when an application is being shutdown.
    - The use of IPMICONSOLE_ENGINE_CLOSE_FD has been clarified in
      the header file.  Some of the prior text was unclear.
      Behavior has not been changed.
  o In ipmi-oem, support Intel get-bmc-services and set-bmc-
    services commands.
  o In ipmi-oem, support Gigabyte get-nic-mode and set-nic-mode

- Drop freeipmi-max-sensor.patch, included upstream

- Update to 1.4.0 beta0

  Tools - New Features
  --------------------
  o Support new tool ipmi-config.  Ipmi-config is a consolidated
    configuration tool implementing everything that was previously in
    bmc-config, ipmi-pef-config, ipmi-sensors-config, and
    ipmi-chassis-config.
    - The consolidated tool will allow users to checkout, commit, and
      diff sections/fields across the four former tools using only one
      tool.
    - The consolidated tool will also allow users to checkout, commit,
      and diff new sections/fields not yet covered in the four former
      tools.
    - Legacy scripts for bmc-config, ipmi-pef-config,
      ipmi-sensors-config, and ipmi-chassis-config will point to the new
      tool with all appropriate options to ensure full backwards
      compatability.
    - The ipmi-pef-config --info option has been made legacy.  It is
      still supported but no longer advertised.
  o Support Intel Data Center Host Interface / Management Engine as
    optional driver type for in-band communication.
    - Typically these are loaded as /dev/dcmi and /dev/mei drivers.
    - This driver is identified as the "inteldcmi" type, as it is
      specific to Intel systems.
  o Support OEM extensions for Intel Windmill, Wiwynn Windmill, and
    Quanta Winterfell motherboards in ipmi-sel and ipmi-sensors.  These
    motherboards are also know as motherboards for the Open Compute
    Project (OCP).
  o Support DCMI configuration in ipmi-config.
  o Update FreeIPMI for changes in IPMI 2.0 Errata 5.  Include are:
    - New sensor events for Power Supply and OS Boot sensors.  New
      events are supported in all areas, ipmi-sensors, ipmi-sel,
      libipmimonitoring, etc.
    - PEF now supports 255 filter numbers, not 127.  This is supported
      in ipmi-config (formerly ipmi-pef-config).
    - Support get/set of new System Info Parameters Present OS Version,
      BMC URL, and Base OS/Hypervisor URL.  This is supported in
      bmc-info and bmc-device.
  o Update ipmi-oem Intel Node Manager OEM commands for changes listed
    in Intelligent Power Node Manager 2.0 specification.
    - Due to changes in the specification, minor text changes may exist
      in some output from intelnm OEM commands.
  o Update ipmi-sel to support new SEL events in Intelligent Power Node
    Manager 2.0 specification.

  Tools - Bug Fixes/Minor Changes
  -------------------------------
  o Fix bmc-info output of GUID, format was output with two bytes out of
    order.
    - May affect scripts parsing and using the GUID.
  o Bmc-info now supports --get-system-guid and outputs the System GUID
    as well as the Device GUID by default.
    - The Device GUID is not prefixed with the text "Device GUID"
      instead of just "GUID".  Any scripts scripting against this will
      need to be adjusted.
  o Bmc-info now supports a workaround of 'guidformat' to read the GUID
    with a format a number of vendors have incorrectly used.
  o In ipmi-config's sensor configuration, decimal values that cannot be
    encoded accurately now report a clearer error message.

  Libraries
  ---------

  o Update libfreeipmi and libipmimonitoring to support IPMI 2.0 Errata 5.
    Included are:
    - Support new sensor events for Power Supply and OS Boot sensors.

    - Support new System Info Parameters for Present OS Version, BMC
      URL, and Base OS/Hypervisor URL.
  o Update libfreeipmi to support Intel Node Manager payloads per Intel
    Intelligent Power Node Manager 2.0 specification.
    - Due to changes in the specification, some payload fields have been
      changed.

  o In all tools reporting time (ipmi-sel, ipmi-fru, ipmi-oem,
    bmc-device, ipmi-sensors, ipmi-dcmi), timestamps are now reporting
    under the assumption the timestamp is already in localtime (compared
    to being in UTC time and converted to localtime).  This is by
    definition in the IPMI specification.
  o In all tools reporting time (ipmi-sel, ipmi-fru, ipmi-oem,
    bmc-device, ipmi-sensors, ipmi-dcmi), support --utc-to-localtime,
    --localtime-to-utc, and --utc-offset options to allow users to
    adjust timestamps as needed for certain environments.
  o In ipmi-fru, support output of DDR3 SDRAM modules.
  o In ipmi-fru, support output of new FRU multirecords, most notably
    extended DC output and extended DC load (per FRU Revision 1.2
