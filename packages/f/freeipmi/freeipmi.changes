  o Fix invalid flag clear in libipmiconsole that can lead to a potential
    double close on a file descriptor.
  o Support Supermicro H8SGL-F OEM sensors and events.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct  4 08:32:38 UTC 2016 - kkaempf@suse.com

- Update to 1.5.4
  o Various changes/fixes in libipmiconsole
    - If user retrieves file descriptor from ipmiconsole_ctx_fd,
      user is required to close it.  ipmiconsole_ctx_destroy no
      longer closes it.  This is to avoid a potential double close
      which can be a problem for multithreaded applications. This
      is a change in behavior, but we do not believe this will
      affect most applications since most users close the file
      descriptor under most scenarios anyways.
    - ipmiconsole_ctx_destroy() should now be called to free
      resources even if ipmiconsole_engine_teardown() has been
      called.  This has been done to create consistent behavior in
      the API and avoid a former segfault possibility.  This is a
      change in behavior, but we do not believe this will affect
      most applications since ipmiconsole_engine_teardown() is
      only called when an application is being shutdown.
    - The use of IPMICONSOLE_ENGINE_CLOSE_FD has been clarified in
      the header file.  Some of the prior text was unclear.
      Behavior has not been changed.
  o In ipmi-oem, support Intel get-bmc-services and set-bmc-
    services commands.
  o In ipmi-oem, support Gigabyte get-nic-mode and set-nic-mode
    commands.
  o Support Gigabyte MD90-FS0-ZB OEM SEL events.

- Drop freeipmi-max-sensor.patch, included upstream

- Update to 1.4.0 beta0

  Tools - New Features
  --------------------
  o Support new tool ipmi-config.  Ipmi-config is a consolidated
    configuration tool implementing everything that was previously in
    bmc-config, ipmi-pef-config, ipmi-sensors-config, and
    ipmi-chassis-config.
    - The consolidated tool will allow users to checkout, commit, and
      diff sections/fields across the four former tools using only one
      tool.
    - The consolidated tool will also allow users to checkout, commit,
      and diff new sections/fields not yet covered in the four former
      tools.
    - Legacy scripts for bmc-config, ipmi-pef-config,
      ipmi-sensors-config, and ipmi-chassis-config will point to the new
      tool with all appropriate options to ensure full backwards
      compatability.
    - The ipmi-pef-config --info option has been made legacy.  It is
      still supported but no longer advertised.
  o Support Intel Data Center Host Interface / Management Engine as
    optional driver type for in-band communication.
    - Typically these are loaded as /dev/dcmi and /dev/mei drivers.
    - This driver is identified as the "inteldcmi" type, as it is
      specific to Intel systems.
  o Support OEM extensions for Intel Windmill, Wiwynn Windmill, and
    Quanta Winterfell motherboards in ipmi-sel and ipmi-sensors.  These
    motherboards are also know as motherboards for the Open Compute
    Project (OCP).
  o Support DCMI configuration in ipmi-config.
  o Update FreeIPMI for changes in IPMI 2.0 Errata 5.  Include are:
    - New sensor events for Power Supply and OS Boot sensors.  New
      events are supported in all areas, ipmi-sensors, ipmi-sel,
      libipmimonitoring, etc.
    - PEF now supports 255 filter numbers, not 127.  This is supported
      in ipmi-config (formerly ipmi-pef-config).
    - Support get/set of new System Info Parameters Present OS Version,
      BMC URL, and Base OS/Hypervisor URL.  This is supported in
      bmc-info and bmc-device.
  o Update ipmi-oem Intel Node Manager OEM commands for changes listed
    in Intelligent Power Node Manager 2.0 specification.
    - Due to changes in the specification, minor text changes may exist
      in some output from intelnm OEM commands.
  o Update ipmi-sel to support new SEL events in Intelligent Power Node
    Manager 2.0 specification.

  Tools - Bug Fixes/Minor Changes
  -------------------------------
  o Fix bmc-info output of GUID, format was output with two bytes out of
    order.
    - May affect scripts parsing and using the GUID.
  o Bmc-info now supports --get-system-guid and outputs the System GUID
    as well as the Device GUID by default.
    - The Device GUID is not prefixed with the text "Device GUID"
      instead of just "GUID".  Any scripts scripting against this will
      need to be adjusted.
  o Bmc-info now supports a workaround of 'guidformat' to read the GUID
    with a format a number of vendors have incorrectly used.
  o In ipmi-config's sensor configuration, decimal values that cannot be
    encoded accurately now report a clearer error message.

  Libraries
  ---------

  o Update libfreeipmi and libipmimonitoring to support IPMI 2.0 Errata 5.
    Included are:
    - Support new sensor events for Power Supply and OS Boot sensors.

    - Support new System Info Parameters for Present OS Version, BMC
      URL, and Base OS/Hypervisor URL.
  o Update libfreeipmi to support Intel Node Manager payloads per Intel
    Intelligent Power Node Manager 2.0 specification.
    - Due to changes in the specification, some payload fields have been
      changed.

    to being in UTC time and converted to localtime).  This is by
    definition in the IPMI specification.
  o In all tools reporting time (ipmi-sel, ipmi-fru, ipmi-oem,
