    completed when verbose >= 1 (sort of progress bar)
  + Display information about physical disks as well as partitions
    in "fsarchiver probe <mode>"
  + Fixed bug with archive splitting: the split size was sometimes
    incorrect due to an integer overflow
  + Added option "--exclude/-e <pattern>" to exclude files/dirs.
    It works for both archiving and extracting.

Wed Dec 23 12:19:06 UTC 2009 - lazy.kent.suse@gmail.com

- Bugfixes:

    it's compiled in 32bit. The split size is incorrect and then
    it either splits with an incorrect volume size or it does not
    split the archives.

    upgraded to a version which is more recent than the libgcrypt
    used at compilation time when the fsarchiver package is built.

    which is not supported (Thanks to mbiebl)
  + Fixed crash when mount fails (mntbyfsa was set to true and not
    clear if mount fails)
  + Fixed code for ntfs symlinks (they have to be recreated
    as normal files and dirs + special attributes)

    message if inappropriate version found

    in the archive to allow doing checks at restfs
