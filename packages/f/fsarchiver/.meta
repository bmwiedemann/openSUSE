  <title>Filesystem Archiver for Linux</title>
  <description>FSArchiver is a system tool that allows you to save the contents of
a file-system to a compressed archive file. The file-system can be
restored on a partition which has a different size and it can be
restored on a different file-system. Unlike tar/dar, FSArchiver also
creates the file-system when it extracts the data to partitions.
Everything is checksummed in the archive in order to protect the data.
If the archive is corrupt, you just loose the current file, not the
whole archive.</description>
