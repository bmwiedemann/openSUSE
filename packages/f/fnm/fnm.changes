- Update to version 1.38.1:
  * fix --use-on-cd failing with newly released default of --resolve-engines when engines key didn't exist
- Changes since 1.38.0:
  * enable --resolve-engines by default. out of experimental phase. to disable it,
    add a --resolve-engines=false flag, and make sure to open an issue describing
    why. It might feel like a breaking change but .nvmrc and .node-version have
    precedence so it should not.
  * better error handling for malformed json
  * Having install and uninstall aliases
