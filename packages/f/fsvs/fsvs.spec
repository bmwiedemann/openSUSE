%description
FSVS is the abbreviation for “Fast System VerSioning”, and is pronounced
[fisvis].

It is a complete backup/restore/versioning tool for all files in a directory
tree or whole filesystems, with a subversionTM repository as the backend.

You may think of it as some kind of tar or rsync with versioned storage.
