-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Mar  8 15:02:25 UTC 2015 - cornelis@solcon.nl

- Update to 2.18:
  * Important notes about installing and for packagers/distributors:
    - Frescobaldi is now dependent on the package 'python-ly'. This package
      needs to be installed so that Frescobaldi can run.
      It is listed among the dependencies in the INSTALL file and it can be found
      at https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-ly.
      Previously, this python package was contained in the frescobaldi_app folder.
      So, when overwriting previous Frescobaldi installations, be sure that any
      remnants from the old 'ly' package are removed, with a command like:
      rm -r /usr/local/<python site-packagesdir>/frescobaldi_app/ly
      Otherwise, Frescobaldi won't find the new ly module and will fail to run.
      Python-ly version 0.9 is required for Frescobaldi 2.18.
    - Python 3.2 (or higher) is supported and recommended! But Python 2.7 will
      continue to be supported during the full Frescobaldi 2 lifecycle.
  * New features:
    - Midi import, using the LilyPond-provided midi2ly tool
    - ABC import, using the LilyPond-provided abc2ly tool
    - In the Editor Preferences, you can select which quotes will be used as
      single and double (primary and secondary) typographical quotes (issue #529)
    - The music view now can display a PDF document with two pages next to each
      other, starting with a right or left page, and in single pages (issue #575)
    - A new pitch tool, Mode shift, which can be used to change all or selected
      notes to a specified mode or scale.
    - Commands to convert rests to spaces or vice versa, and to convert pitched
      rests (like c'4\rest) to normal rests, contributed by Peter Bjuhr.
    - Command to open LilyPond data directory (useful if you want to study Lily's
      own init- and Scheme files).
  * Improvements:
   - The Insert menu got renamed to Snippets, making more clear how it is used
      and can be changed. When copying text to a new snippet, the snippet is added
      to the menu by default, but the user can change that while editing.
    - Ctrl+Break (LilyPond → Abort Engraving Job) also stops an autocompile job
      if one is running.
    - The SVG View now displays a default gray background when no document is
      loaded, which is more helpful than a white background.
    - When right-clicking in the editor, the editor does not scroll anymore to
      show more surrounding lines.
    - Multi-line block comments are now also foldable (issue #587)
    - The magnifying glass in the Music View does not clip to the page borders
      anymore, which was annoying when showing many pages in a small size.
    - To save space in the toolbar, the almost never used Save As... button was
      removed. But when holding the Save button longer, three choices pop up:
      Save, Save As and Save All.
    - Ctrl-Mousewheel zooming the LilyPond Log now works properly.
  * Bugfixes:
    - The german ("deutsch") pitch names asas and heses are now handled correctly.
      Previously, when translating the "nederlands" beses to german, it was output
      as bes, instead of heses. Same for "norsk" and "suomi" (issue #415)
    - If the preference "Open default viewer after successful compile" is enabled,
      the viewer to be opened is determined from the actual results, instead of
      the default output format. This fixes the PDF view opening instead of the
      SVG view, when the SVG format was chosen in the Engrave Custom dialog.
    - fix AttributeError: 'unicode' object has no attribute 'insert' (issue #543)
    - the transpose functions will not transpose the chord after \stringTuning
      anymore (issue #539).
    - fix error when opening a "recent file" that has been deleted (issue #597)
    - Quick Insert articulations etc. now also work with q (repeated) chords
      (issue #628, fixed in python-ly)
    - Quick Insert: do not add articulation to the duration of a \tuplet command
    (issue #631, fixed in python-ly)
  * Translations:
    - updated: nl, fr, ru, it
* Added required python-ly as part of this package, should be split off in future

      contributed by Peter Bjuhr

      but the user is working on a different document (wish: issue #513)
    - tooltips for the panel title and float/close buttons

    - Ctrl+C in editor view does not copy HTML, only plain text (issue #517)

      that are not completely finished are hidden by default but become visible
      when this preference is enabled. New features are enabled after a restart,
      or when a new main window is created using Window→New.

- Update to 2.0.14:
  * the status bar now shows the position in the music or the length of the
    selected music

    scrolling (wish #45)
  * Custom engrave: the anti-alias-factor can be set in the dialog (wish #361)
  * on Mac OS X the applications remains active when all main windows are
    closed. This is expected behaviour on Mac OS X.
  * New builtin snippet, linked to Ctrl+D by default, to double the current

  * A new preference for new documents: whether a new document is created empty,
    with the preferred LilyPond version in it, or using a template from the
    snippets list

  * Basic MusicXML export, contributed by Peter Bjuhr (this was also already
    added in Frescobaldi 2.0.12)
  * The "master" variable is back, allbeit in a slightly different
    implementation: the redirected filename is not directly given to a LilyPond
    process running on behalf of the current document, but the other document
    is loaded (if it wasn't already) and LilyPond is run on that document
  * Bugfixes

      score wizard, creating a new document when clicking Ok, contributed by Urs
      Liska
    - Word-related cursor movements have been improved. The backslash is now
      considered a word boundary, even if there are no spaces between several

  Changes in 1.1.7 -- October 4th, 2010
  
  * New features:
    - New tool to download LilyPond binary releases. Go to Settings -> Configure
      Frescobaldi -> LilyPond Preferences, Versions -> Add -> Download to use it.
    - New rhythm command "Make implicit (per line)" that removes repeated
      durations, except for the first duration in a line.
  * Quick Insert Panel:
    - New default shortcuts for Slur: Ctrl+( and Breathing sign: Alt+'
  * Bugfixes and improvements:
    - Don't error out if certain GUI containers can't be found, due to missing
      objects in the local frescobaldiui.rc file. Display a message instead.
  * PDF Preview:
    - If 'Sync preview' is unchecked, the preview now also doesn't open newly
      created or updated PDF documents. As a result, the 'Disable PDF preview'
      setting became superfluous and has been removed.
  * LilyPond Log:
    - The toolbar at the bottom has been removed, as all functions in the main
      menu and toolbar are now equivalent.
  * Translations:
    - Dutch updated by Wilbert Berendsen
    - Turkish updated by Server Acim

  Changes in 1.1.6 -- September 10th, 2010
  
  * New features:
    - New built-in MIDI player using the KMidPart of KMid 2.4.0 or higher
    - Notification popup when a long build finishes while Frescobaldi is hidden
    - Quick Insert: new panels for dynamics, bar lines, spanners, arpeggios, etc
    - LilyPond version to use configurable per session
  * Bugfixes and improvements:
    - Fix error message on Cut&Assign, introduced in 1.1.3
    - Expand dialog: Don't insert expansion when closed with ESC
    - Handle keyboard interrupt (SIGINT) nicely, don't show the bug dialog
    - Fix session --start commandline option
    - Blank staff paper: improved bar line distances with recent LilyPond versions
  * Installation:
    - Install Frescobaldi icon as SVG, not SVGZ
    - make uninstall now possible

  Changes in 1.1.5 -- August 16th, 2010
  
  * Bugfixes and improvements:
    - Work-around a crash introduced in KDE 4.5 when using the --smart option
      to set the cursor position.
    - Fix Python error message when adding a new LilyPond version with the "Set as
      default" option checked.
  * Translations:
    - Czech updated by Pavel Fric
    - Polish updated by Piotr Komorowski
    - French updated by Ryan Kavanagh
    - Turkish updated by Server Acim
  
  Changes in 1.1.4 -- July 28th, 2010
  
  * Bugfixes:
    - Fix Point and Click when running from 'run' script
  
  Changes in 1.1.3 -- July 25th, 2010
  
  * General:
    - Tabs can be reordered (can be turned off)
    - Tabs don't get automatic shortcuts, they sometimes conflict with ours
    - the right tool dock has been made slightly larger by default
  * New: Session Management, in two ways:
    - Basic session management: if you log out with Frescobaldi running and then
      back in, Frescobaldi will reopen the documents that were open at logout.
    - Advanced named session support. A session defines a list of open documents,
      and optionally a base directory. More features will be added later to be
      able to use this as a light-weight project tool.
  * Context sensitive LilyPond help:
    - added support for internals reference: contexts, grobs and engravers
  * Bugfixes:
    - Fix crash when editing toolbars
  * Installation:
    - A 'run' script has been added to run Frescobaldi from the tarball (or even
      SVN) without installing.
    - Using CMake out-of-source is now easier: icons and translations are not
      rebuilt anymore so the Frescobaldi install procedure does not need LilyPond
      and 'convert' (from ImageMagick) anymore. The icons and translations are in
      the prebuilt/ directory. Simply removing this directory restores the old
      behaviour (useful when you want to develop Frescobaldi from a release
      tarball, although a fresh SVN checkout is recommended in that case).
  * Translations:
    - Dutch updated by Wilbert Berendsen
    - Turkish updated by Server Acim
  
  Changes in 1.1.2 -- July 8th, 2010
  
  * New features:
    - Segno bar line added (available in LilyPond 2.13.19 and higher)
    - It is now possible to configure the path that is used to find
      files that are included via the LilyPond \include command.
    - New 'Close other' action to close all documents except the current
    - Print and View icons in the toolbar to print music and open PDF and MIDI
      files in their external helper applications
  * Printing:
    - Printing generated PDF files now uses a print dialog, instead of just
      sending the PDF to the 'lpr' command.
  * Run LilyPond:
    - warn if the document contains a conflicting point and click setting
  * General:
    - print and email actions have moved to the File menu
    - close button on document tabs (can be turned off in Settings->Editor Comp.)
    - warnings and notifications have a "dont ask again" checkbox, and can be
      turned back on in the settings
    - progress indicator saves the build time in document metainfo
  * Autocompletion:
    - only popup completions from the expansion manager on blank lines
  * Settings dialog:
    - the settings have been organized in more logical groups
  * Installation:
    - building the icons from SVN or out-of-source requires LilyPond >= 2.13.19
  * Translations:
    - Dutch updated by Wilbert Berendsen
    - French updated by Valentin Villenave
    - Italian updated by Gianluca D'Orazio
  
  Changes in 1.1.1 -- May 3rd, 2010
  
  * LilyPond Documentation Browser:
    - Indexing help items fixed with new website (2.13+)
  * Fixed Python error message on opening settings dialog with recent SIP/PyQt
  * Translations:
    - Dutch updated by Wilbert Berendsen
    - Turkish updated by Server Acim
  
  Changes in 1.1.0 -- March 26th, 2010
  
  * It is now possible to use multiple versions of LilyPond easily from within
    Frescobaldi. LilyPond instances can be configured under Settings, Paths.
    There is also a custom Run LilyPond command where a version can be chosen,
    among other options.  And Frescobaldi can be configured to automatically
    choose a LilyPond version according to the document's \version statement.
  * Score Wizard, Choir:
    - New lyric option "Distribute stanzas" to spread the stanzas between staves.
      This option only has effect when there are three or more staves, and is very
      useful if there is a large number of stanzas that apply to all voices.
    - Lyric placement is fine-tuned when LilyPond >= 2.13.4 is used, using the
      staff-affinity setting, so lyrics are placed close to the staff they belong
      to. If lyrics apply to multiple voices, the are centered between staves.
      This improves the layout of vocal music if the systems are vertically
      streched by LilyPond to fill the page nicely.
    - New checkbox to create rehearsal MIDI files. If checked, one MIDI file is
      generated for each voice, with the voice standing out in a clear sound and
      the other voices in a lower volume. Repeats are unfolded and lyrics for the
      current voice are also added to the MIDI file.
  * Score Wizard, Score settings:
    - New checkbox option to wrap the score in a \book block.
  * New dialog to insert special characters from the Unicode table, with the
    ability to assign keyboard shortcuts to often used characters.
  * New command: Copy Lyrics with hyphenation removed
  * Expansion Dialog:
    - has now some documented default keyboard shortcuts
  * Quick Insert Panel:
    - New buttons for \halfopen and \snappizzicato
    - It is now possible to assign keyboard shortcuts to the articulation buttons
  * Repeat last expression: don't append space
  * Email files: select files with checkboxes instead of Ctrl+Click
  * Installation:
    - byte compiling the Python modules can be supressed by adding
      -DBYTECOMPILE=NO to the cmake command line
    - building the icons from SVN or out-of-source requires LilyPond 2.13.11+
  * Some workarounds for subtle SIP 4.10/KDE 4.4 garbage collection bugs
  
  Changes in 1.0.2 -- February 18th, 2010
  
  * Make Frescobaldi working with SIP 4.10 and KDE 4.4
  
  Changes in 1.0.1 -- January 17th, 2010
  
  * Translations:
    - New Galician translation by Manuel A. Vázquez
  * Bugfixes:
    - Rumor: Make config dialog more robust if no MIDI outputs available
    - Score Wizard: Fix disappearing instrumentName if this is a markup object and
      the same one as shortInstrumentName
    - Stability improvements
    - Some corrections in the default expansions of the Expansion Manager
  
  Changes in 1.0.0 -- December 26th, 2009
  
  * Editor:
    - Right-click menu action on \include command now opens the named file from
      the LilyPond data directory if that exists and there is no local file with
      that name.
  * Repeat last expression (Ctrl+;):
    - Doesn't repeat normal rests and skips, but rather the chord preceding it
    - Keeps the \rest when repeating a pitched rest (e.g. c\rest)
    - Only removes the octave from the repeated pitch (or from the first pitch
      of the repeated chord) inside \relative music expressions
  * Blank staff paper tool:
    - option to remove small "FRESCOBALDI.ORG" tagline at bottom
  * Score Wizard:
    - Fix lyrics not added if there is only one staff (reported by M. Moles)
  * Quick Insert Panel:
    - If cursor is inside a chord, note or rest, the cursor is positioned right
      after the chord, note or rest before the articulation is inserted (if there
      is no selection, in which case the articulation is inserted after all
      chords, notes or rests). So now you can click a note in the PDF and directly
      click a button to add an articulation or ornament etc. without repositioning
      the cursor manually.
  * PDF preview:
    - Action in contextmenu to reload PDF document
  * General:
    - Fix crash on moving tools around
    - Fix crash on exit on some systems with multiple updated documents open
    - Work around crash on logging out from the built-in terminal and then hiding
      and re-showing it, that occurs due to a bug in SIP 4.9.1
    - ESC key now closes PDF-preview dialogs properly
    - ESC key does not take focus away from editor window if PDF visible
    - Main window is activated when clicking on notes in detached PDF viewer
    - Fix interaction with SIP 4.9.3 (some settings were not saved, like paths)
    - Fix order of cautionary accidentals and octave marks in pitches (affects
      transpose and relative/absolute conversion functions)
    - Fix attribute error on file dialogs in KDE 4.1 (but KDE 4.2 is recommended)
    - Fix document name not shown in tab bar if opening non-existing file
    - Improved hyphenation dictionaries search, also some explanation in docs
  * Installation:
    - CMake now does not require a compiler to be present anymore
  * Translations:
    - Dutch updated by Wilbert Berendsen
    - Spanish updated by Francisco Vila
    - Turkish updated by S. Acim
    - Italian updated by Gianluca D'Orazio
    - French updated by Ryan Kavanagh
    - Czech updated by Pavel Fric
    - Polish updated by Piotr Komorowski
    - German updated by Georg Hennig
  
  Changes in 0.7.17 -- November 29th, 2009
  
  * Expansion Dialog:
    - It is now possible to assign keyboard shortcuts to snippets in the dialog
    - Improved syntax coloring in snippet entry
  * Autocompletion:
    - If the autocompleter does not find any suitable completions, matching
      expansions from the Expansion dialog are shown
  * Score Wizard:
    - Harp, Guitar and Jazz Guitar: allow multiple voices per staff
    - Choir: checkbox for automatic piano reduction
  * General bugfixes and improvements:
    - When quitting, the last seen documents, starting with the current, are
      closed first. This way, if the user cancels the quit, the current document
      (if modified) remains the same.
    - Files can be opened by dropping them on the Frescobaldi window
    - Fix crash when swichting to a document opened using the Open File dialog
      when multiple files were opened at the same time
    - All pitch manipulation functions better detect the end of unbracketed markup
      expressions like: g g g-\markup \sharp g g g.  Frescobaldi now knows the
      number of arguments each markup command has and will not mistake the g after
      \sharp for a markup argument.
  * Installation:
    - building and installing the User Guide has been improved. If meinproc4 or
      the XSL stylesheets can't be found, only a warning is printed and the cache
      file (index.cache.bz2) is not pre-generated, but the install will continue.
      (If there is no cache file, KHelpcenter will generate one on a per-user
      basis as soon as the User Guide is displayed for the first time.)
  * Translations:
    - Dutch updated by me
    - Spanish updated by Francisco Vila
    - Polish updated by Piotr Komorowski
    - Czech updated by Pavel Fric
    - French updated by Ryan Kavanagh
  
  Changes in 0.7.16 -- November 15th, 2009
  
  * New command to transpose music
  * New commands for conversion between relative and absolute pitches
  * New: Alt+Shift+Up/Down selects text till next or previous blank line, and
    Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Up/Down moves the selected block to the next or previous blank
    line. This gives a very quick way to reorder fragments of LilyPond input.
  * A new tool to create empty staff paper
  * Improved support for quarter tones in all pitch-related functions
  * Translations:
    - French updated by Ryan Kavanagh
    - Spanish updated by Francisco Vila
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct 13 20:07:53 UTC 2009 - jcnengel@googlemail.com

- Update to 0.7.15
  * New LilyPond documentation browser providing context-sensitive help
  * New shortcuts:
    - Repeat selected music, Ctrl+Shift+R: wraps the selection in a
      \repeat volta 2 { music... } construct
    - Insert pair of braces, Ctrl+{: wraps the selection in braces, or inserts
      { newline newline } and places the cursor on the middle indented line.
  * New bar lines submenu to insert different types of bar lines
  * Expansion Manager:
    - Two cursormarks (|) can be used to select a range of text after expanding
    - New contextmenu command to add selected text to expansions
  * Autocompletion:
    - named colors are shown in the right color
    - some often used block commands like \header now also insert the braces,
      and place the cursor between them.
    - names of variables (like composer in the header) automagically append ' = ' 
      if the remainder of the line does not start with the '=' character.
  * New commands in the Log context menu to copy or save its contents.
  * LilyPond symbol icons are displayed white if the users color palette settings
    have light text on a dark background. The icons are automatically recolored
    if the user changes the color preferences while Frescobaldi is running.
  * The Save As... dialog now really opens in the default directory if the
    document has no filename yet.
  * Tools can be shown/hidden with configurable keyboard shortcuts
  * Score Wizard: parts can be reordered by dragging with the mouse
  * Documentation updates
  * Translations:
    - Turkish updated by S. Acim
    - Russian updated by Artem Zolochevskiy
    - Polish updated by Piotr Komorowski
    - Dutch updated by Wilbert Berendsen
