- Update to version 2.10.4
  * In  `ftview', custom  LCD  filter values  are  now normalized  and
    balanced.  Unorthodox filters are still available through the `-L'
    command line option.
  * The GUI demo programs can now be resized.
  * Demo programs that accept command  line option `-k' can now handle
    function keys, too.  The  corresponding character codes start with
    0xF1.  As  an example, the  POSIX shell syntax (accepted  by bash,
    ksh, and zsh) -k $'\xF3q' emulates the pressing of function key `F3'
    followed by key `q'.

    glyphs.
  * `ftglyph' has limited support to display fonts with
    color-layered glyphs.This will be improved later on.
  * `ftgrid' can now display bitmap fonts also.
  * The `ttdebug' demo program has a new option `-f' to select a
    member of a TrueType collection (TTC).

- Remove "Supplements: fonts-config" to avoid accidentally pulling
  in Qt dependencies on some non-Qt based desktops.(boo#1091109)

  * IMPORTANT BUG FIXES
    - Handling of  uncompressed PCF files works again (bug
      introduced in version 2.5.4).
- Drop freetype2-2.5.3-fix-pcf.patch, merged upstream

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec  8 15:43:58 UTC 2014 - hrvoje.senjan@gmail.com

- Update to version 2.5.4
  * IMPORTANT BUG FIXES
    - A variant of vulnerability CVE-2014-2240 was identified
      (cf.  http://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?43661) and fixed
      in  the new CFF driver.  All users should upgrade.
    - The new auto-hinter code using HarfBuzz crashed for some
      invalid fonts.
    - Many fixes to better protect against malformed input.
  * IMPORTANT CHANGES
    - Full auto-hinter support of the Devanagari script.
    - Experimental auto-hinter support of the Telugu script.
    - CFF stem darkening behaviour can now be controlled at
      build time using the eight macros
      CFF_CONFIG_OPTION_DARKENING_PARAMETER_{X,Y}{1,2,3,4}    .
    - Some fields in the `FT_Bitmap'  structure have been changed
      from signed to unsigned type, which better reflects
      the actual usage. It is also an additional means to
      protect against malformed input. This change doesn't break
      the ABI; however, it might cause compiler warnings.
  * MISCELLANEOUS
    - Improvements to  the auto-hinter's algorithm to recognize
      stems and local extrema.
    - Function `FT_Get_SubGlyph_Info' always returned an error
      even in case of success.
    - Version  2.5.1 introduced major bugs in the cjk part of
      the auto-hinter, which are now fixed.
    - The `FT_Sfnt_Tag' enumeration values have been changed to
      uppercase,  e.g.  `FT_SFNT_HEAD'. The lowercase variants
      are deprecated. This is for orthogonality with all other
      enumeration (and enumeration-like) values in FreeType.
    - `cmake' now supports builds of FreeType as an OS X framework
      and for iOS.
    - Improved project files for vc2010,
      introducing a property file
    - The documentation generator for the API reference has been
      updated to produce  better HTML code (with proper  CSS).
      At the same time, the documentation got a better structure.
    - The FT_LOAD_BITMAP_CROP flag is obsolete; it is not used
      by any driver.
    - The TrueType DELTAP[123] bytecode instructions now work in
      subpixel hinting mode as described in the ClearType
      whitepaper (i.e., for touched points in the
      non-subpixel direction).
    - Many small improvements to the internal arithmetic routines.
- Rebase don-t-mark-libpng-as-required-library.patch,
  bugzilla-308961-cmex-workaround.patch, freetype2-subpixel.patch,
  freetype2-bitmap-foundry.patch and overflow.patch
- Add freetype2-2.5.3-fix-pcf.patch from upstream to resolve
  http://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?43774, "Freetype 2.5.4 does not
  load ungzipped PCF fonts"

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Mar  9 18:39:56 UTC 2014 - hrvoje.senjan@gmail.com

- Update to version 2.5.3
  * IMPORTANT BUG FIXES
    - A vulnerability was  identified and fixed in the  new CFF
      driver (cf. http://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?41697;  it
      doesn't have a CVE number yet).  All users should upgrade.
    - More  bug  fixes related  to  correct  positioning of
      composite glyphs.
    - Many fixes to better protect against malformed input.
  * IMPORTANT CHANGES
    - FreeType can now use the HarfBuzz library to greatly improve
      the auto-hinting of  fonts that  use OpenType features:
      Many glyphs that are part  of such features but don't have
      cmap entries are now handled  properly, for  example small
      caps or superscripts. Define the configuration  macro
      FT_CONFIG_OPTION_USE_HARFBUZZ to activate HarfBuzz support.
      You need HarfBuzz version 0.9.19 or newer. Note that HarfBuzz
      depends on  FreeType; this currently causes a chicken-and-egg
      problem  that can be  solved as follows  in case HarfBuzz
      is not yet installed on your system.
        1. Compile  and  install  FreeType without the configuration
           macro FT_CONFIG_OPTION_USE_HARFBUZZ.
        2. Compile and install HarfBuzz.
        3. Define  macro  FT_CONFIG_OPTION_USE_HARFBUZZ, then
           compile and install FreeType again.
      With FreeType's  `configure' script the procedure  boils
      down to configure, build, and install Freetype, then
      configure, compile, and  install  HarfBuzz,  then configure,
      compile,  and  install FreeType again (after executing
      `make distclean').
    - All  libraries FreeType  depends on  are now  checked
      using  the `pkg-config' configuration files  first,
      followed by alternative methods.
    - The  new  value  `auto'  for the  various  `--with-XXX'
      library options   (for   example   `--with-harfbuzz=auto')
      makes   the `configure' script automatically link to the
      libraries it finds. This is now the default.
    - In case FreeType's `configure' script  can't find a
      library, you can  pass environment  variables to  circumvent
      pkg-config,  and those variables  have been  harmonized as
      a consequence  of the changes mentioned above:
        LIBZ           -> removed; use LIBZ_CFLAGS and LIBZ_LIBS
        LIBBZ2         -> removed; use BZIP2_CFLAGS and BZIP2_LIBS
        LIBPNG_LDFLAGS -> LIBPNG_LIBS
      `./configure --help' shows all available environment variables.
    - The `freetype-config'  script now understands
      option `--static' to emit static linking information.
- Due to buildsystem changes, rename and rebase
  don-t-mark-libpng-as-required-library-in-freetype-co.patch to
  don-t-mark-libpng-as-required-library.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec 12 16:45:13 UTC 2013 - hrvoje.senjan@gmail.com

- Added patches:
  * don-t-mark-libpng-as-required-library-in-freetype-co.patch: it's
    private in pkgconfig file, and causes issues in downstream
    packages
- As per patch, remove libpng-devel Requires from devel package

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec 11 07:13:14 UTC 2013 - arvidjaar@gmail.com

Tue Dec 10 03:04:59 UTC 2013 - hrvoje.senjan@gmail.com

- Update to version 2.5.2
  * Fixed bug  that made  FreeType crash  on some  popular (but  not
    fully conformant) fonts like `ahronbd.ttf'
  * Another round of improvements to correct positioning and hinting
    of composite glyphs in TrueType fonts
  * Fixed bug introduced in version  2.5.1: handling embedded
    bitmap strikes of  TrueType fonts, caused garbage display
    under some circumstances
  * Fixed `ftgrid' demo program compilation in non-development
    builds
- Droped fix-compile-in-non-debug.patch, included in this release

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov 27 19:31:42 UTC 2013 - hrvoje.senjan@gmail.com

- Update to version 2.5.1
  * For  some WinFNT  files,  the last  glyph  wasn't displayed  but
    incorrectly marked as invalid.
  * The vertical size of glyphs was  incorrectly set after a call to
    `FT_GlyphSlot_Embolden', resulting in clipped glyphs.
  * Many fields of the `PCLT' table in SFNT based fonts (if accessed
    with `FT_Get_Sfnt_Table') were computed incorrectly.
  * In TrueType fonts,  hinting of composite glyphs  could sometimes
    deliver  incorrect positions  of  components or  even  distorted
    shapes.
  * WOFF font format support has been added.
  * The auto-hinter now supports Hebrew.  Greek and Cyrillic support
    has been improved.
  * Support for the forthcoming `OS/2'  SFNT table version 5, as can
    be found e.g. in the `Sitka' font family for Windows 8.1.
  * The header  file layout  has been changed.   After installation,
    all files are now located in `<prefix>/include/freetype2'.
    Applications  that  use   (a)  `freetype-config'  or  FreeType's
    `pkg-config' file to get the include directory for the compiler,
    and (b) the documented way for header inclusion like
        #include <ft2build.h> or #include FT_FREETYPE_H
    don't need any change to the source code.
  * The stem  darkening feature  of the  new CFF  engine can  now be
    fine-tuned with the new `darkening-parameters' property.
  * `ftgrid' has been updated to toggle various engines with the `H'
    key, similar to `ftview' and `ftdiff'.
  * The functionality of `ttdebug' has been greatly enhanced.
   . It now displays twilight, storage, and control value data; key
  * Better support of ARMv7 and x86_64 processors.
  * Apple's `sbix' color bitmap format is now supported.
  * Improved   auto-hinter  rendering   for  many   TrueType  fonts,
    especially in the range 20-40ppem.
  * A  new face  flag  `FT_FACE_FLAG_COLOR' has  been  added (to  be
    accessed with the macro `FT_HAS_COLOR').
  * `FT_Gzip_Uncompress'   (modeled    after   zlib's   `uncompress'
    function)  has been  added; this  is a  by-product of  the newly
    added WOFF support.
  * Support for  a build with  `cmake' has been contributed  by John
    Cary <cary@txcorp.com>.
  * Support for x64  builds with Visual C++ has  been contributed by
    Kenneth Miller <kennethadammiller@yahoo.com>
  * Manual pages for most demo programs have been added.
  * The GETINFO bytecode instruction for TrueType fonts was buggy if
    used to retrieve subpixel hinting information.  It was necessary
    to set  selector bit 6  to get  results for selector  bits 7-10,
    which is wrong.
  * Improved computation  of emulated vertical metrics  for TrueType
    fonts.
  * Fixed horizontal start-up position of vertical phantom points in
    TrueType bytecode.
- Rebase freetype2-subpixel.patch to current release
- Added fix-compile-in-non-debug.patch, fixes release build of ftdemos
- Added overflow.patch for resolving post-build-check detected error:
  I: Statement is overflowing a buffer

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul  3 08:33:20 UTC 2013 - idonmez@suse.com

- Update to version 2.5.0
  * ftview has been updated to  support color embedded bitmaps.
  * The 'ttdebug' program has been further improved.  In particular,
    it accepts a new command line  option `-H' to select the hinting
    engine.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May 10 18:09:21 UTC 2013 - idonmez@suse.com

- Update to version 2.4.12
  * Using the `H'  key, it is now possible to  select the CFF engine
    in both ftview and ftdiff.
  * The new command line option '-H' for `ftbench' selects the Adobe
    CFF engine.
  * It is  now possible  to directly select  the LCD  rendering mode
    with the keys 'A'-'F' in  'ftview'.  The key mapping for cycling
    through LCD modes  has been changed from 'K' and  'L' to 'k' and
    'l', and  toggling custom LCD  filtering is no longer  mapped to
    key 'F' but to key 'L'.
  * In `ftdiff',  key 'x' toggles  between layout modes:  Either use
    the  advance width  (this is  new and  now the  default) or  the
    bounding box information to determine line breaks.
  * For all demo  tools, the new command line option  `-v' shows the
    version.
  * For the demo tools with a GUI, the new command line options '-w'
    and '-h' select  the width and the height of  the output window,
    respectively.
- Drop ft2demos-build-testname.patch, not needed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 18 16:38:09 CEST 2008 - mfabian@suse.de

- fix uninitialized pointer "FT_STREAM stream" in function
  FT_Open_Face() which made fontforge crash while trying to apply
  a workaround to the sazanami-fonts because fontforge called
  FT_Open_Face() with 0 for the FT_Library argument and
  then freetype crashed in FT_Stream_Free().

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul 23 12:20:30 CEST 2008 - mfabian@suse.de

- update to 2.3.7. Extract from the docs/CHANGES file:
  • If the library was compiled on an i386 platform using gcc, and
    compiler option -O3 was given, `FT_MulFix' sometimes returned
    incorrect results which could have caused problems with
    `FT_Request_Metrics' and `FT_Select_Metrics', returning an
    incorrect descender size.
  • Pure CFFs without subfonts were scaled incorrectly if the font
    matrix was non-standard.  This bug has been introduced in
    version 2.3.6.
  • The `style_name' field in the `FT_FaceRec' structure often
    contained a wrong value for Type 1 fonts.  This misbehaviour
    has been introduced in version 2.3.6 while trying to fix
    another problem.  [Note, however, that this value is
    informative only since the used algorithm to extract it is
    very simplistic.]
  • Two new macros, FT_OUTLINE_SMART_DROPOUTS and
    FT_OUTLINE_EXCLUDE_STUBS, have been introduced.  Together with
    FT_OUTLINE_IGNORE_DROPOUTS (which was ignored previously) it is
    now possible to control the dropout mode of the `raster' module
    (for B&W rasterization), using the `flags' field in the
    `FT_Outline' structure.
  • The TrueType bytecode interpreter now passes the dropout mode to
    the B&W rasterizer.  This greatly increases the output for small
    ppem values of many fonts like `pala.ttf'.
  • A bunch of potential security problems have been found.  All
    users should update.
  • Microsoft Unicode cmaps in TrueType fonts are now always
    preferred over Apple cmaps.  This is not a bug per se, but there
    exist some buggy fonts created for MS which have broken Apple
    cmaps.  This affects only the automatic selection of FreeType;
    it's always possible to manually select an Apple Unicode cmap if
    desired.
  • Many bug fixes to the TrueType bytecode interpreter.
  • Improved Mac support.
  • Subsetted CID-keyed CFFs are now supported correctly.
  • CID-keyed CFFs with subfonts which are scaled in a non-standard
    way are now handled correctly.
  • A call to FT_Open_Face with `face_index' < 0 crashed FreeType if
    the font was a Windows (bitmap) FNT/FON.
  • The new function `FT_Get_CID_Registry_Ordering_Supplement' gives
    access to those fields in a CID-keyed font.  The code has been
    contributed by Derek Clegg.
  • George Williams contributed code to validate the new `MATH'
    OpenType table (within the `otvalid' module).  The `ftvalid'
    demo program has been extended accordingly.
  • An API for cmap 14 support (for Unicode Variant Selectors, UVS)
    has been contributed by George Williams.
  • A new face flag FT_FACE_FLAG_CID_KEYED has been added, together
    with a macro FT_IS_CID_KEYED which evaluates to 1 if the font is
    CID-keyed.
  • Build support for symbian has been contributed.
  • Better WGL4 glyph name support, contributed by Sergey Tolstov.
  • Debugging output of the various FT_TRACEX macros is now sent to
    stderr.
  • The `ftview' demo program now provides artificial slanting too.
  • The `ftvalid' demo program has a new option `-f' to select the
    font index.
- remove patch for bnc#399169 (came from upstream).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul 03 16:19:11 CEST 2007 - mfabian@suse.de

- update to 2.3.5. Extract from the doc/CHANGES file:
  • Some subglyphs in TrueType fonts were handled incorrectly due
   to a missing graphics state reinitialization.
  • Large .Z files  (as distributed with some X11  packages)
    weren't handled correctly, making FreeType increase the heap
    stack in an endless loop.
  • A large number of bugs have been fixed to avoid crashes and
    endless loops with invalid fonts.
  • The two new cache functions  `FTC_ImageCache_LookupScaler' and
    `FTC_SBit_Cache_LookupScaler' have been added to allow lookup of
    glyphs using an  `FTC_Scaler' object;  this makes it possible to
    use fractional pixel sizes in the cache.  The demo programs have
    been updated accordingly to use this feature.
  • A new API  `FT_Get_CMap_Format' has been added to  get the
    cmap format  of a  TrueType font.   This  is useful  in handling
    PDF files. The code has been contributed by Derek Clegg.
  • The  auto-hinter now  produces better output by default for
    non-Latin scripts like Indic.  This was done by using the CJK
    hinting module as the default instead of the Latin one. Thanks
    to Rahul Bhalerao for this suggestion.
  • A new API `FT_Face_CheckTrueTypePatents' has been added to find
    out whether a given TrueType font uses patented bytecode
    instructions.  The `ft2demos' bundle contains a new program
    called `ftpatchk' which demonstrates its usage.
  • A new API `FT_Face_SetUnpatentedHinting' has been added to
    enable or disable the unpatented hinter.
  • Support for Windows FON files in PE format has been contributed
    by Dmitry Timoshkov.

  (caused crashes in xpdf, kpdf, acroread for me for many
  .pdf files).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr 10 16:42:14 CEST 2007 - mfabian@suse.de

- update to 2.3.4. Extract from the doc/CHANGES file:
  • A serious bug in the handling of bitmap fonts (and bitmap
    strikes of outline fonts) has been introduced in 2.3.3.
  • Remove a serious regression in the TrueType bytecode
    interpreter that was introduced in version 2.3.2.  Note that
    this does not disable the improvements introduced to the
    interpreter in version 2.3.2, only some ill cases that occurred
    with certain fonts (though a few popular ones).
  • The auto-hinter now ignores single-point contours for
    computing blue zones.  This bug created `wavy' baselines when
    rendering text with various fonts that use these contours to
    model mark-attach points (these are points that are never
    rasterized and are placed outside of the glyph's real
    outline).
  • The `rsb_delta' and `lsb_delta' glyph slot fields are now set
    to 0 for mono-spaced fonts.  Otherwise code that uses them
    would essentially ruin the fixed-advance property.
  • Fix CVE-2007-1351 which can cause an integer overflow while
    parsing BDF fonts, leading to a potentially exploitable heap
    overflow condition.
  • FreeType returned incorrect kerning information from TrueType
    fonts when the bytecode interpreter was enabled.  This
    happened due to a typo introduced in version 2.3.0.
  • Negative kerning values from PFM files are now reported
    correctly (they were read as 16-bit unsigned values from the
    file).
  • Fixed a small memory leak when `FT_Init_FreeType' failed for
    some reason.
  • The Postscript hinter placed and sized very thin and ghost
    stems incorrectly.
  • The TrueType bytecode interpreter has been fixed to get rid
    of most of the rare differences seen in comparison to the
    Windows font loader.
  • A new demo program `ftdiff' has been added to compare
    TrueType hinting, FreeType's auto hinting, and rendering
    without hinting in three columns.
  • The auto-hinter now better deals with serifs and corner cases
    (e.g., glyph '9' in Arial at 9pt, 96dpi).  It also improves
    spacing adjustments and doesn't change widths for non-spacing
    glyphs.

  • The TrueType interpreter sometimes returned incorrect
    horizontal metrics due to a bug in the handling of the SHZ
    instruction.
  • A typo  in  a  security  check  introduced  after
    version 2.2.1 prevented FreeType to render some glyphs in CFF

  Therefore, 3rd party which linked statically against Qt might
  not work after upgrading from SLES8 to SLES9.

- add freetype2-bitmap-style.patch: check the bdf properties
  WEIGHT_NAME and SLANT case insensitively. Without that,
  these properties are not correctly recognized when the fonts
  specify them in lower case.

- Bug #24755: further improvement: add " Wide" to the family name
  for fonts which have an average width >= point size, i.e. fonts
  which have glyphs which are at least square (or maybe even
  wider). This makes fonts which contain only double width
  characters (for example the "misc-fixed" 18x18ja.bdf) clearly
  distinct from single width fonts of the same family and
  avoids that they get accidentally selected via freetype2/Xft2.

- Bug #24775: partly fixed by a patch to freetype which returns
  "FOUNDRY FAMILY_NAME" as the family_name for bitmap fonts.
  Without that change, all bitmap fonts which have "Fixed"
  in FAMILY_NAME also had the same family_name "Fixed" via
  freetype/Xft2 and it was not possible to distinguish between
  them, therefore the selection of "Fixed" bitmap fonts produced
  quite surprising results. After this change, the fonts show
  up for example as "Misc Fixed", "Etl Fixed", etc. via
  freetype2/Xft2, which makes it easy to select the right one.

- add freetype2-bc.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jan 25 21:57:05 CET 2003 - mfabian@suse.de

- use the original names for the utilities, i.e. ftdump
  instead of ft2dump, etc. ... (I renamed the utilities
  in freetype1 to ft1dump, ft1view, etc. ...

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 13 18:20:36 CET 2003 - mfabian@suse.de

- new package ft2demos, version 2.1.3
