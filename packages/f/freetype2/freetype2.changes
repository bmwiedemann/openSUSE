Sat Jul 15 14:36:07 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 2.13.1:
  * New function  `FT_Get_Default_Named_Instance` to get the
    index of the default named instance of an OpenType Variation
    Font. A new load flag `FT_LOAD_NO_SVG` to make FreeType ignore
    glyphs in an 'SVG ' table.
  * New function  `FT_GlyphSlot_AdjustWeight` to adjust
    the glyph weight either  horizontally or  vertically.
    This is part of the `ftsynth.h` header file
  * TrueType interpreter  version 38 (also known  as
    'Infinality') has been deactivated; the value  of
    `TT_INTERPRETER_VERSION_38` is now the same as
    `TT_INTERPRETER_VERSION_40`.
  * Switching named instances on and  off in Variation Fonts
    was buggy if the design coordinates didn't change.
- drop enable-infinality-subpixel-hinting.patch (obsolete, infinality
  is deactivated)

Thu May 25 08:20:04 UTC 2023 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Do not limit ftdump conflict to < version-release, but only to
  version. Ftdump is built in a second build flavor and as such the
  release counters are not guaranteed to be in sync.

- Fix license tag to FTL and GPL-2.0-only.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar  8 20:07:24 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 2.13.0:
  * The 'COLR' v1 API is now considered as stable.
    https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/colr
  * For  OpenType  Variable Fonts,  `avar`  table  format 2.0  is  now
    supported.  The code was contributed by Behdad Esfahbod.
    Note that this is an extension supported on recent Apple platforms
    and by HarfBuzz, but not yet in the OpenType standard!  See
      https://github.com/harfbuzz/boring-expansion-spec/blob/main/avar2.md
    for the specification.  To deactivate it, define the configuration
    macro 'TT_CONFIG_OPTION_NO_BORING_EXPANSION'.
  * A new API  `FT_GlyphSlot_Slant` to slant a glyph by  a given angle
    has been added.   Note that this function is  part of `ftsynth.h`,
    which is still considered to be in alpha stage.
  * TrueType interpreter version 38  (also known as 'Infinality') that
    was first introduced about 10 years  ago in FreeType 2.4.11 is now
    deprecated and slated to be removed in the next version.  TrueType
    interpreter version 40 has been FreeType's default version for six
    years now and provides an excellent alternative.  This is the last
    FreeType     version     with    TT_INTERPRETER_VERSION_38     and
    TT_INTERPRETER_VERSION_40 treated differently.
  * The  only  referenced  but never  documented  configuration  macro
    `FT_CONFIG_OPTION_NO_GLYPH_NAMES` has been removed.
  * To  avoid  reserved identifiers  that  are  globally defined,  the
    auto-hinter  debugging   macros  (which  are  only   available  if
    `FT_DEBUG_AUTOFIT` is defined)

    ```
    _af_debug_disable_horz_hints
    _af_debug_disable_vert_hints
    _af_debug_disable_blue_hints
    _af_debug_hints
    ```

    have been renamed to

    ```
    af_debug_disable_horz_hints_
    af_debug_disable_vert_hints_
    af_debug_disable_blue_hints_
    af_debug_hints_
    ```

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May  2 08:59:14 UTC 2022 - Paolo Stivanin <info@paolostivanin.com>

- Update to 2.12.1:
  - Loading CFF fonts sometimes made FreeType crash (bug introduced in
    version 2.12.0)
  - Loading  a fully  hinted  TrueType glyph  a  second time  (without
    caching) sometimes yielded different rendering results if TrueType
    hinting was active (bug introduced in version 2.12.0).
  - The generation of the pkg-config file `freetype2.pc` was broken if
    the build was done with cmake (bug introduced in version 2.12.0).
  - The  meson  build  no  longer enforces  both  static  and  dynamic
    versions of the library by default.
  - The internal  zlib library was  updated to version  1.2.12.  Note,
    however, that  FreeType is *not* affected  by CVE-2018-25032 since
    it only does decompression.
- Drop freetype-2.12.0-cff_slot_load-segfault.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr  8 17:06:49 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 2.12.0:
  - FreeType  now   handles  OT-SVG  fonts,  to   be  controlled  with
   `FT_CONFIG_OPTION_SVG`  configuration macro.   By default,  it can
    only load the 'SVG ' table of an OpenType font.  However, by using
    the `svg-hooks` property of the new 'ot-svg' module it is possible
    to register an  external SVG rendering engine.   The FreeType demo
    programs  have been  set  up  to use  'librsvg'  as the  rendering
    library. 
  - The handling of fonts with an 'sbix' table has been improved.
  - The internal 'zlib'  code has been updated to be  in sync with the
    current 'zlib' version (1.2.11).
  - The  previously internal  load  flag  `FT_LOAD_SBITS_ONLY` is  now
    public.
  - Some  minor improvements  of the  building systems,  in particular
    handling of the 'zlib' library (internal vs. external).
  - Support for non-desktop Universal Windows Platform.
  - Various other minor bug and documentation fixes.
  - The `ftdump` demo  program shows more information  for Type1 fonts
    if option `-n` is given.
  - `ftgrid` can now display embedded bitmap strikes.
  - fixes bsc#1198830 (CVE-2022-27404), bsc#1198832 (CVE-2022-27405),
    bsc#1198823 (CVE-2022-27406)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec  2 22:07:29 UTC 2021 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 2.11.1:
  * Some  fields  in  the  `CID_FaceDictRec`, `CID_FaceInfoRec`, and
    `FT_Data` structures  have been changed  from signed to unsigned
    type,  which  better reflects  the actual usage.  It is also  an
    additional means to protect against malformed input.
  * Cmake support  has been  further improved.   To do  that various
    backward-incompatible  changes were  necessary; please  see file
    `CMakeLists.txt` for more details.
  * The experimental  'COLR' v1 API  has been updated to  the latest
    OpenType standard 1.9.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul 23 07:10:11 UTC 2021 - Ismail Dönmez <ismail@i10z.com>

- Update to version 2.11.0
  * A new rendering  module has been added to create 8-bit  Signed
    Distance Field (SDF)  bitmaps for both outline and bitmap glyphs.
  * A new, experimental API is now available for surfacing properties
    of 'COLR' v1 color fonts.
  * A new function `FT_Get_Transform` returns the values set by
    FT_Set_Transform.
  * The legacy Type 1 and CFF engines are further demoted due to lack
    of CFF2 charstring support.
  * The experimental 'warp' mode (AF_CONFIG_OPTION_USE_WARPER) for the
    auto-hinter has been removed.
  * The smooth rasterizer performance has been improved by >10%.
  * PCF bitmap fonts compressed with LZW (these are usually files with
    the extension .pcf.Z) are now handled correctly.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct 20 09:38:30 UTC 2020 - Ismail Dönmez <idonmez@suse.com>

- Update to version 2.10.4
  * Fix a heap buffer overflow has been found  in the handling of
    embedded PNG bitmaps, introduced in FreeType version 2.6
    (CVE-2020-15999 bsc#1177914)
  * Minor improvements to the B/W rasterizer.
  * Auto-hinter support for Medefaidrin script.
  * Fix various  memory leaks (mainly  for CFF) and other  issues that
    might cause crashes in rare circumstances.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat May  9 10:24:29 UTC 2020 - Ismail Dönmez <idonmez@suse.com>

- Update to version 2.10.2
  * Support for WOFF2 fonts, add BR on pkgconfig(libbrotlidec)
  * Function `FT_Get_Var_Axis_Flags' returned random data for Type 1
    MM fonts.
  * Type 1 fonts with non-integer metrics are now supported by the new
    (CFF) engine introduced in FreeType 2.9.
  * Drop support for Python 2 in Freetype's API reference generator
  * Auto-hinter support for Hanifi Rohingya
  * Document the `FT2_KEEP_ALIVE' debugging environment variable.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct  9 17:06:32 UTC 2019 - Cristian Rodríguez <crrodriguez@opensuse.org>

- Use the compiler default C std, since 2012 gcc defaults
  have changed, we now only need to get rid of ANSIFLAGS, override
  that variable instead.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul  2 07:19:53 UTC 2019 - Ismail Dönmez <idonmez@suse.com>

- Update to version 2.10.1
  * The bytecode hinting of OpenType variation fonts was flawed, since
    the data in the `CVAR' table wasn't correctly applied.
  * Auto-hinter support for Mongolian.
  * The handling of  the default character in PCF fonts as  introduced
    in version 2.10.0 was partially broken, causing premature abortion
    of charmap iteration for many fonts.
  * If  `FT_Set_Named_Instance' was  called  with  the same  arguments
    twice in a row, the function  returned an incorrect error code the
    second time.
  * Direct   rendering   using  FT_RASTER_FLAG_DIRECT   crashed   (bug
    introduced in version 2.10.0).
  * Increased  precision  while  computing  OpenType  font   variation
    instances.
  * The  flattening  algorithm of  cubic  Bezier  curves was  slightly
    changed to make  it faster.  This can cause  very subtle rendering
    changes, which aren't noticeable by the eye, however.
  * The  auto-hinter  now  disables hinting  if there  are blue  zones
    defined for a `style' (i.e., a certain combination of a script and
    its related typographic features) but the font doesn't contain any
    characters needed to set up at least one blue zone.
- Add tarball signatures and freetype2.keyring

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun 24 07:09:55 UTC 2019 - Ismail Dönmez <idonmez@suse.com>

- Update to version 2.10.0
  * A bunch of new functions has been added to access and process
    COLR/CPAL data of OpenType fonts with color-layered glyphs.
  * As a GSoC 2018 project, Nikhil Ramakrishnan completely
    overhauled and modernized the API reference.
  * The logic for computing the global ascender, descender, and
    height of OpenType fonts has been slightly adjusted for
    consistency.
  * `TT_Set_MM_Blend' could fail if called repeatedly with the same
    arguments.
  * The precision of handling deltas in Variation Fonts has been
    increased.The problem did only show up with multidimensional
    designspaces.
  * New function `FT_Library_SetLcdGeometry' to set up the geometry
    of LCD subpixels.
  * FreeType now uses the `defaultChar' property of PCF fonts to set
    the  glyph for  the undefined  character  at glyph  index 0  (as
    FreeType already does for all other supported font formats).  As
    a consequence, the order of glyphs of a PCF font if accessed
    with  FreeType can be different now compared to previous
    versions.
    This change doesn't affect PCF font access with cmaps.
  * `FT_Select_Charmap' has been changed to allow  parameter value
    `FT_ENCODING_NONE', which is valid for BDF, PCF, and Windows FNT
    formats to access built-in cmaps that don't have a predefined
    `FT_Encoding' value.
  * A previously reserved field in the `FT_GlyphSlotRec' structure
    now holds the glyph index.
  * The usual round of fuzzer bug fixes to better reject malformed
    fonts.
  * `FT_Outline_New_Internal' and `FT_Outline_Done_Internal' have
    been removed.These two functions were public by oversight only
    and were never documented.
  * A new function `FT_Error_String' returns descriptions of error
    codes if configuration macro FT_CONFIG_OPTION_ERROR_STRINGS is
    defined.
  * `FT_Set_MM_WeightVector' and `FT_Get_MM_WeightVector' are new
    functions limited to Adobe MultiMaster fonts to directly set and
    get the weight vector.

Tue Jan  9 11:34:51 UTC 2018 - idonmez@suse.com

- Update to version 2.9
  * Advance width values of variation fonts were often wrong.
  * More fixes for variation font support; you should update to
    this version if you want to support them.
  * As a GSoC project, Ewald Hew extended the new (Adobe) CFF
    engine to handle Type 1 fonts also, thus greatly improving
    the rendering of this format. This is the new default.
  * A new function, `FT_Set_Named_Instance', can be used to set
    or change the current named instance.
  * Starting with this FreeType version, resetting variation
    coordinates will return to the currently selected named
    instance. Previously, FreeType returned to the base font 
    (i.e., no instance set).
  * Some fuzzer fixes to better reject malformed fonts.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 18 09:15:41 UTC 2017 - idonmez@suse.com

- Update to version 2.8.1
  * B/W  hinting   of  TrueType   fonts  didn't  work   properly  if
    interpreter version 38 or 40 was selected.
  * Some severe  problems within the handling  of TrueType Variation
    Fonts were found and fixed.
  * Function `FT_Set_Var_Design_Coordinates' didn't correctly handle
    the case with less input coordinates than axes.
  * By default,  FreeType  now offers  high  quality  LCD-optimized
    output  without resorting to ClearType techniques of resolution
    tripling and filtering.  In this method,  called Harmony,  each
    color channel is generated separately  after shifting the glyph
    outline,  capitalizing on the fact  that the color grids on LCD
    panels  are  shifted  by  a third  of  a pixel.  This output is
    indistinguishable from ClearType with a light 3-tap filter.
  * Using the  new function `FT_Get_Var_Axis_Flags',  an application
    can access the `flags' field  of a variation axis (introduced in
    OpenType version 1.8.2)
  * FreeType  now synthesizes  a  missing Unicode  cmap for  (older)
    TrueType fonts also if glyph names are available.
  * The warping option  has moved  from `light'  to `normal' hinting
    where  it replaces  the original hinting algorithm.  The `light'
    mode is now always void of any hinting in x-direction.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May 15 10:36:18 UTC 2017 - idoenmez@suse.de

- Update to version 2.8
  * Support for OpenType Variation Fonts is now complete. The last
    missing part was handling the `VVAR' and `MVAR' tables, which is
    available with this release.

  * A new  function `FT_Face_Properties' allows the  control of some
    module  and   library  properties  per  font.    Currently,  the
    following properties can be  handled: stem darkening, LCD filter
    weights, and the random seed for the `random' CFF operator.
  
  * The PCF change to show more `colourful' family names (introduced
    in version 2.7.1) was too radical; it can now be configured with
    PCF_CONFIG_OPTION_LONG_FAMILY_NAMES   at   compile   time.    If
    activated, it can  be switched off at run time  with the new pcf
    property  `no-long-family-names'.  If  the `FREETYPE_PROPERTIES'
    environment variable is available, you can say

    FREETYPE_PROPERTIES=pcf:no-long-family-names=1
  * Support  for  the  following  scripts  has  been  added  to  the
    auto-hinter.

    Adlam, Avestan, Bamum, Buhid, Carian, Chakma, Coptic, Cypriot,
    Deseret, Glagolitic, Gothic, Kayah, Lisu, N'Ko, Ol Chiki, Old
    Turkic, Osage, Osmanya, Saurashtra, Shavian, Sundanese, Tai
    Viet, Tifinagh, Unified Canadian Syllabics, Vai
    
  *  `Light' auto-hinting  mode no  longer uses TrueType  metrics for
     TrueType  fonts.   This bug  was  introduced  in version  2.4.6,
     causing   horizontal  scaling   also.    Almost  all   GNU/Linux
     distributions (with Fedora as  a notable exception) disabled the
     corresponding patch for good reasons; chances are thus high that
     you won't notice a difference.

  * If a TrueType font gets loaded with FT_LOAD_NO_HINTING, FreeType
    now scales  the font linearly  again (bug introduced  in version
    2.4.6).
    
  * Fixed CVE-2017-8105,  CVE-2017-8287:  Older   FreeType  versions
    have out-of-bounds  writes  caused  by  heap-based  buffer  overflows
    related to Type 1 fonts. (boo#1035807, boo#1036457)

- See https://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/freetype2/2.8/ for
  the complete changelog.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jan  1 11:58:27 UTC 2017 - idonmez@suse.com

- Update to version 2.7.1:
  * IMPORTANT CHANGES
    + Support for the new CFF2 font format as introduced with
      OpenType 1.8 has been contributed by Dave Arnolds from Adobe.
    + Preliminary support for variation fonts as specified in
      OpenType 1.8 (in addition to the already existing support for
      Adobe's MM and Apple's GX formats). Dave Arnolds contributed
      handling of advance width change variation; more will come in
      the next version.
  * IMPORTANT BUG FIXES
    + Handling of raw CID fonts was partially broken (bug introduced
      in 2.6.4).
  * MISCELLANEOUS
    + Some limits for TrueType bytecode execution have been tightened
      to speed up FreeType's handling of malformed fonts, in
      particular to quickly abort endless loops.
    + The number of twilight points can no longer be set to an
      arbitrarily large value.
    + The total number of jump opcode instructions (like JMPR) with
      negative arguments is dynamically restricted; the same holds
      for the total number of iterations in LOOPCALL opcodes.
    + The dynamic limits are based on the number of points in a glyph
      and the number of CVT entries. Please report if you encounter a
      font where the selected values are not adequate.
    + PCF family names are made more `colourful'; they now include the
      foundry and information whether they contain wide characters.
      For example, you no longer get `Fixed' but rather `Sony Fixed'
      or `Misc Fixed Wide'.
    + A new function `FT_Get_Var_Blend_Coordinates' (with its alias
      name `FT_Get_MM_Blend_Coordinates') to retrieve the normalized
      blend coordinates of the currently selected variation instance
      has been added to the Multiple Masters interface.
    + A new function `FT_Get_Var_Design_Coordinates' to retrieve the
      design coordinates of the currently selected variation instance
      has been added to the Multiple Masters interface.
    + A new load flag `FT_LOAD_BITMAP_METRICS_ONLY' to retrieve bitmap
      information without loading the (embedded) bitmap itself.
    + Retrieving advance widths from bitmap strikes (using
      `FT_Get_Advance' and `FT_Get_Advances') have been sped up.
    + The usual round of fuzzer fixes to better reject malformed
      fonts.
- Drop freetype2-bitmap-foundry.patch, merged upstream.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep  9 16:10:39 UTC 2016 - develop7@develop7.info

- update to version 2.7:
  * IMPORTANT CHANGES
    + As announced earlier, the 2.7.x series now uses the new subpixel
      hinting  mode as  the  default, emulating  a  modern version  of
      ClearType.
      This change inevitably leads to different rendering results, and
      you   might   change   the   `TT_CONFIG_OPTION_SUBPIXEL_HINTING'
      configuration option to  adapt it to your taste (or  use the new
      `FREETYPE_PROPERTIES'    environment    variable).    See    the
      corresponding entry  below for  version 2.6.4, which  gives more
      information.
    + A new option  `FT_CONFIG_OPTION_ENVIRONMENT_PROPERTIES' has been
      introduced.   If  set (which  is  the  default), an  environment
      variable  `FREETYPE_PROPERTIES' can  be used  to control  driver
      properties.  Example:
        FREETYPE_PROPERTIES=truetype:interpreter-version=35 \
                            cff:no-stem-darkening=1 \
                            autofitter:warping=1
      This allows to select, say, the subpixel hinting mode at runtime
      for a given application.  See file `ftoption.h' for more.
  * IMPORTANT BUG FIXES
    + After  loading a  named instance  of  a GX  variation font,  the
      `face_index'  value  in  the returned  `FT_Face'  structure  now
      correctly holds the named instance  index in the upper 16bits as
      documented.
  * MISCELLANEOUS
    + A new macro `FT_IS_NAMED_INSTANCE' to  test whether a given face
      is a named instance.
    + More fixes to GX font handling.
    + Apple's   `GETVARIATION'  bytecode   operator  (needed   for  GX
      variation font support) has been implemented.
    + Another round  of fuzzer fixes,  mainly to reject  invalid fonts
      faster.
    + Handling of raw CID fonts  was broken (bug introduced in version
      2.6.4).
    + The smooth rasterizer has been streamlined  to make it faster by
      approx. 20%.
    + The `ftgrid'  demo program now  understands command  line option
      `-d' to give start-up design coordinates.
    + The `ftdump' demo program has  a new command line option `-p' to
      dump TrueType bytecode instructions.
- removed freetype2-subpixel.patch in favor of above 
  FREETYPE_PROPERTIES environment variable

Wed Jul 13 06:48:31 UTC 2016 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 2.6.5:
  + Compilation works again  on Mac OS X (bug introduced in version
    2.6.4).
  + The new  subpixel hinting  mode is now  disabled by  default; it
    will  be enabled  by default  in the  forthcoming 2.7.x  series.
    Main reason for reverting this feature is the principle of least
    surprise: a  sudden change in  appearance of all fonts  (even if
    the rendering improves  for almost all recent  fonts) should not
    be expected in a new micro version of a series.
- Rebase freetype2-subpixel.patch.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul  8 08:35:09 UTC 2016 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Upadte to version 2.6.4:
  * A new subpixel hinting mode, which is now the default rendering
    mode for TrueType fonts. It implements (almost everything of)
    version 40 of the bytecode engine. The existing code base in
    FreeType (the `Infinality code') was stripped to the bare
    minimum and all configurability removed in the name of speed
    and simplicity. The configurability was mainly aimed at legacy
    fonts like Arial, Times New Roman, or Courier. [Legacy fonts
    are fonts that modify vertical stems to achieve clean
    black-and-white bitmaps.] The new mode focuses on applying a
    minimal set of rules to all fonts indiscriminately so that
    modern and web fonts render well while legacy fonts render
    okay. Activation of the subpixel hinting support can be
    controlled with the `TT_CONFIG_OPTION_SUBPIXEL_HINTING'
    configuration option at compile time: If set to value 1, you
    get the old Infinality mode (which was never the default due to
    its slowness). Value 2 activates the new subpixel hinting mode,
    and value 3 activates both. The default is value 2. At run
    time, you can select the subpixel hinting mode with the
    `interpreter-version' property (provided you have compiled in
    the corresponding hinting mode); see `ftttdrv.h' for more.
  * Support for the following scripts has been added to the
    auto-hinter: Armenian, Cherokee, Ethiopic, Georgian, Gujarati,
    Gurmukhi, Malayalam, Sinhala, Tamil.
- Rebase freetype2-subpixel.patch.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 28 11:54:15 UTC 2016 - idonmez@suse.com

- Update to version 2.6.3
  * IMPORTANT CHANGES
    - Khmer,  Myanmar, Bengali,  and Kannada  script support  has been
      added to the auto-hinter.
  
  * MISCELLANEOUS
    - Better  support of  Indic  scripts like  Devanagari  by using  a
      top-to-bottom hinting flow.

    - All  FreeType macros  starting  with two  underscores have  been
      renamed to  avoid a violation of  both the C and  C++ standards.
      Example: Header  macros of the  form `__FOO_H__' are  now called
      `FOO_H_'.  In most cases,  this should be completely transparent
      to the user.   The exception to this  is `__FTERRORS_H__', which
      must be  sometimes undefined by  the user to get  FreeType error
      strings:  Both this  form and  the new  `FTERRORS_H_' macro  are
      accepted for backwards compatibility.

    - Minor improvements mainly to the Type 1 driver.

    - The  new CFF  engine now  supports all  Type 2  operators except
      `random'.

    - The macro `_STANDALONE_', used for  compiling the B/W and smooth
      rasterizers  as   stand-alone  modules,  has  been   renamed  to
      `STANDALONE_', since macro names starting with an underscore and
      followed by an uppercase letter are reserved in both C and C++.

    - Function  `FT_Library_SetLcdFilterWeights'  now  also  activates
      custom LCD filter weights (instead of just adjusting them).

    - Support for  `unpatented hinting'  has been  completely removed:
      Consequently,  the two  functions `FT_Face_CheckTrueTypePatents'
      and  `FT_Face_SetUnpatentedHinting'  now  return  always  false,
      doing nothing.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Nov 29 13:34:58 UTC 2015 - idonmez@suse.com

- Update to version 2.6.2
  * IMPORTANT CHANGES
    - The auto-hinter now supports stem darkening, to be controlled by
      the    new   `no-stem-darkening'    and   `darkening-parameters'
      properties.   This is  an  experimental  feature contributed  by
      Nikolaus Waxweiler, and  the interface might change  in a future
      release.

    - By default, stem darkening is now switched off (for both the CFF
      engine and the  auto-hinter).  The main reason is  that you need
      linear  alpha  blending  and  gamma correction  to  get  correct
      rendering results, and  the latter is not yet  available in most
      freely  available  rendering  stacks like  X11.   Applying  stem
      darkening without proper gamma correction  leads to far too dark
      rendering results.

    - The   meaning  of   `FT_RENDER_MODE_LIGHT'  has   been  slightly
      modified.   It  now  essentially  means `no  hinting  along  the
      horizontal  axis'; in  particular,  no change  of glyph  advance
      widths.  Consequently, the auto-hinter  is used for all scalable
      font  formats  except  for  CFF.    It  is  planned  that  other
      font-specific rendering engines (TrueType, Type 1) will follow.

  * MISCELLANEOUS

    - The default  LCD filter  has been changed  to be  normalized and
      color-balanced.

    - For    better    compatibility   with    FontConfig,    function
      `FT_Library_SetLcdFilter'  accepts   a  new   enumeration  value
      `FT_LCD_FILTER_LEGACY1'   (which  has   the   same  meaning   as
      `FT_LCD_FILTER_LEGACY').

    - A large number of bugs have been detected by using the libFuzzer
      framework,  which should  further  improve  handling of  invalid
      fonts.  Thanks again to Kostya Serebryany and Bungeman!

    - `TT_CONFIG_OPTION_MAX_RUNNABLE_OPCODES',  a   new  configuration
      option, controls the maximum number of executed opcodes within a
      bytecode program.  You don't want to change this except for very
      special  situations (e.g.,  making a  library fuzzer  spend less
      time to handle broken fonts).

    - The smooth renderer has been made faster.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Oct  4 22:19:32 UTC 2015 - baiduzhyi.devel@gmail.com

- Update to version 2.6.1
  * IMPORTANT BUG FIXES
    - It turned  out that for CFFs  only the advance widths  should be
      taken from the  `htmx' table, not the side  bearings.  This bug,
      introduced in  version 2.6.0, makes  it necessary to  upgrade if
      you are using  CFFs; otherwise, you get cropped  glyphs with GUI
      interfaces like GTK or Qt.
    - Accessing Type 42 fonts returned  incorrect results if the glyph
      order of the embedded TrueType font differs from the glyph order
      of the Type 42 charstrings table.
  * IMPORTANT CHANGES
    - The header  file layout  has been  changed (again),  moving  all
      header files except `ft2build.h' into a subdirectory tree.
      Doing so  reduces the  possibility of  header file  name clashes
      (e.g., FTGL's  `FTGlyph.h' with FreeType's `ftglyph.h')  on case
      insensitive file systems like Mac OS X or Windows.
      Applications  that  use  (a)  the  `freetype-config'  script  or
      FreeType's `freetype2.pc' file for pkg-config to get the include
      directory  for the  compiler,  and (b)  the  documented way  for
      header inclusion like
        #include <ft2build.h>
        #include FT_FREETYPE_H
        ...
      don't need any change to the source code.
    - Simple access  to named instances  in GX variation fonts  is now
      available (in addition to the  previous method via FreeType's MM
      interface).   In  the `FT_Face'  structure,  bits  16-30 of  the
      `face_index' field hold the current named instance index for the
      given face  index, and bits  16-30 of `style_flags'  contain the
      number of  instances for  the given face  index.  `FT_Open_Face'
      and friends also understand the  extended bits of the face index
      parameter.
      You need to enable  TT_CONFIG_OPTION_GX_VAR_SUPPORT for this new
      feature.  Otherwise, bits  16-30 of the two fields  are zero (or
      are ignored).
    - Lao script support has been added to the auto-hinter.
  * MISCELLANEOUS
    - The auto-hinter's Arabic script support has been enhanced.
    - Superscript-like and  subscript-like glyphs  as used  by various
      phonetic alphabets like the IPA  are now better supported by the
      auto-hinter.
    - The TrueType bytecode interpreter now runs slightly faster.
    - Improved support for builds with cmake.
    - The  function  `FT_CeilFix'  now   always  rounds  towards  plus
      infinity.
    - The  function  `FT_FloorFix'  now always  rounds  towards  minus
      infinity.
    - A  new load  flag `FT_LOAD_COMPUTE_METRICS'  has been  added; it
      makes FreeType  ignore pre-computed  metrics, as needed  by font
      validating  or  font  editing  programs.  Right  now,  only  the
      TrueType  module supports  it  to ignore  data  from the  `hdmx'
      table.
    - Another round of bug fixes  to better handle broken fonts, found
      by Kostya Serebryany <kcc@google.com>.
- Dropping upstreamed patch Dont-use-hmtx-table-for-LSB.patch.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- Add Dont-use-hmtx-table-for-LSB.patch: Fixes gnu#45520, cut off
  fonts in gtk and qt. Taken from upstream git.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun 11 08:54:13 UTC 2015 - idonmez@suse.com

- Update to version 2.6
  * Thread safety improvements
  * Thai script support has been added to the auto-hinter.
  * Arabic script support has been added to the auto-hinter.
  * Following OpenType version 1.7,  advance widths and side bearing
    values in  CFFs (wrapped  in an SFNT  structure) are  now always
    taken from the `hmtx' table.
  * Following OpenType  version 1.7, the  PostScript font name  of a
    CFF font (wrapped in an SFNT structure) is now always taken from
    the `name'  table.  This is  also true for  OpenType Collections
    (i.e., TTCs using  CFFs subfonts instead of TTFs),  where it may
    have a significant difference.
  * Fonts natively hinted for  ClearType are now supported, properly
    handling selector index 3 of the INSTCTRL bytecode instruction.
  * Major improvements to the GX TrueType variation font handling.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec  8 15:43:58 UTC 2014 - hrvoje.senjan@gmail.com

- Update to version 2.5.4
  * IMPORTANT BUG FIXES
    - A variant of vulnerability CVE-2014-2240 was identified
      (cf.  http://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?43661) and fixed
      in  the new CFF driver.  All users should upgrade.
    - The new auto-hinter code using HarfBuzz crashed for some
      invalid fonts.
    - Many fixes to better protect against malformed input.
  * IMPORTANT CHANGES
    - Full auto-hinter support of the Devanagari script.
    - Experimental auto-hinter support of the Telugu script.
    - CFF stem darkening behaviour can now be controlled at
      build time using the eight macros
      CFF_CONFIG_OPTION_DARKENING_PARAMETER_{X,Y}{1,2,3,4}    .
    - Some fields in the `FT_Bitmap'  structure have been changed
      from signed to unsigned type, which better reflects
      the actual usage. It is also an additional means to
      protect against malformed input. This change doesn't break
      the ABI; however, it might cause compiler warnings.
  * MISCELLANEOUS
    - Improvements to  the auto-hinter's algorithm to recognize
      stems and local extrema.
    - Function `FT_Get_SubGlyph_Info' always returned an error
      even in case of success.
    - Version  2.5.1 introduced major bugs in the cjk part of
      the auto-hinter, which are now fixed.
    - The `FT_Sfnt_Tag' enumeration values have been changed to
      uppercase,  e.g.  `FT_SFNT_HEAD'. The lowercase variants
      are deprecated. This is for orthogonality with all other
      enumeration (and enumeration-like) values in FreeType.
    - `cmake' now supports builds of FreeType as an OS X framework
      and for iOS.
    - Improved project files for vc2010,
      introducing a property file
    - The documentation generator for the API reference has been
      updated to produce  better HTML code (with proper  CSS).
      At the same time, the documentation got a better structure.
    - The FT_LOAD_BITMAP_CROP flag is obsolete; it is not used
      by any driver.
    - The TrueType DELTAP[123] bytecode instructions now work in
      subpixel hinting mode as described in the ClearType
      whitepaper (i.e., for touched points in the
      non-subpixel direction).
    - Many small improvements to the internal arithmetic routines.
- Rebase don-t-mark-libpng-as-required-library.patch,
  bugzilla-308961-cmex-workaround.patch, freetype2-subpixel.patch,
  freetype2-bitmap-foundry.patch and overflow.patch
- Add freetype2-2.5.3-fix-pcf.patch from upstream to resolve

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Mar  9 18:39:56 UTC 2014 - hrvoje.senjan@gmail.com

- Update to version 2.5.3
  * IMPORTANT BUG FIXES
    - A vulnerability was  identified and fixed in the  new CFF
      driver (cf. http://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?41697;  it
      doesn't have a CVE number yet).  All users should upgrade.
    - More  bug  fixes related  to  correct  positioning of
      composite glyphs.
    - Many fixes to better protect against malformed input.
  * IMPORTANT CHANGES
    - FreeType can now use the HarfBuzz library to greatly improve
      the auto-hinting of  fonts that  use OpenType features:
      Many glyphs that are part  of such features but don't have
      cmap entries are now handled  properly, for  example small
      caps or superscripts. Define the configuration  macro
      FT_CONFIG_OPTION_USE_HARFBUZZ to activate HarfBuzz support.
      You need HarfBuzz version 0.9.19 or newer. Note that HarfBuzz
      depends on  FreeType; this currently causes a chicken-and-egg
      problem  that can be  solved as follows  in case HarfBuzz
      is not yet installed on your system.
        1. Compile  and  install  FreeType without the configuration
           macro FT_CONFIG_OPTION_USE_HARFBUZZ.
        2. Compile and install HarfBuzz.
        3. Define  macro  FT_CONFIG_OPTION_USE_HARFBUZZ, then
           compile and install FreeType again.
      With FreeType's  `configure' script the procedure  boils
      down to configure, build, and install Freetype, then
      configure, compile, and  install  HarfBuzz,  then configure,
      compile,  and  install FreeType again (after executing
      `make distclean').
    - All  libraries FreeType  depends on  are now  checked
      using  the `pkg-config' configuration files  first,
      followed by alternative methods.
    - The  new  value  `auto'  for the  various  `--with-XXX'
      library options   (for   example   `--with-harfbuzz=auto')
      makes   the `configure' script automatically link to the
      libraries it finds. This is now the default.
    - In case FreeType's `configure' script  can't find a
      library, you can  pass environment  variables to  circumvent
      pkg-config,  and those variables  have been  harmonized as
      a consequence  of the changes mentioned above:
        LIBZ           -> removed; use LIBZ_CFLAGS and LIBZ_LIBS
        LIBBZ2         -> removed; use BZIP2_CFLAGS and BZIP2_LIBS
        LIBPNG_LDFLAGS -> LIBPNG_LIBS
      `./configure --help' shows all available environment variables.
    - The `freetype-config'  script now understands
      option `--static' to emit static linking information.
- Due to buildsystem changes, rename and rebase
  don-t-mark-libpng-as-required-library-in-freetype-co.patch to
  don-t-mark-libpng-as-required-library.patch

    builds
- Droped fix-compile-in-non-debug.patch, included in this release

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov 27 19:31:42 UTC 2013 - hrvoje.senjan@gmail.com

- Update to version 2.5.1
  * For  some WinFNT  files,  the last  glyph  wasn't displayed  but
    incorrectly marked as invalid.
  * The vertical size of glyphs was  incorrectly set after a call to
    `FT_GlyphSlot_Embolden', resulting in clipped glyphs.
  * Many fields of the `PCLT' table in SFNT based fonts (if accessed
    with `FT_Get_Sfnt_Table') were computed incorrectly.
  * In TrueType fonts,  hinting of composite glyphs  could sometimes
    deliver  incorrect positions  of  components or  even  distorted
    shapes.
  * WOFF font format support has been added.
  * The auto-hinter now supports Hebrew.  Greek and Cyrillic support
    has been improved.
  * Support for the forthcoming `OS/2'  SFNT table version 5, as can
    be found e.g. in the `Sitka' font family for Windows 8.1.
  * The header  file layout  has been changed.   After installation,
    all files are now located in `<prefix>/include/freetype2'.
    Applications  that  use   (a)  `freetype-config'  or  FreeType's
    `pkg-config' file to get the include directory for the compiler,
    and (b) the documented way for header inclusion like
        #include <ft2build.h> or #include FT_FREETYPE_H
    don't need any change to the source code.
  * The stem  darkening feature  of the  new CFF  engine can  now be
    fine-tuned with the new `darkening-parameters' property.
  * `ftgrid' has been updated to toggle various engines with the `H'
    key, similar to `ftview' and `ftdiff'.
  * The functionality of `ttdebug' has been greatly enhanced.
   . It now displays twilight, storage, and control value data; key
  * Better support of ARMv7 and x86_64 processors.
  * Apple's `sbix' color bitmap format is now supported.
  * Improved   auto-hinter  rendering   for  many   TrueType  fonts,
    especially in the range 20-40ppem.
  * A  new face  flag  `FT_FACE_FLAG_COLOR' has  been  added (to  be
    accessed with the macro `FT_HAS_COLOR').
  * `FT_Gzip_Uncompress'   (modeled    after   zlib's   `uncompress'
    function)  has been  added; this  is a  by-product of  the newly
    added WOFF support.
  * Support for  a build with  `cmake' has been contributed  by John
    Cary <cary@txcorp.com>.
  * Support for x64  builds with Visual C++ has  been contributed by
    Kenneth Miller <kennethadammiller@yahoo.com>
  * Manual pages for most demo programs have been added.
  * The GETINFO bytecode instruction for TrueType fonts was buggy if
    used to retrieve subpixel hinting information.  It was necessary
    to set  selector bit 6  to get  results for selector  bits 7-10,
    which is wrong.
  * Improved computation  of emulated vertical metrics  for TrueType
    fonts.
  * Fixed horizontal start-up position of vertical phantom points in
    TrueType bytecode.
- Rebase freetype2-subpixel.patch to current release
- Added fix-compile-in-non-debug.patch, fixes release build of ftdemos
- Added overflow.patch for resolving post-build-check detected error:
  I: Statement is overflowing a buffer

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul  3 08:31:13 UTC 2013 - idonmez@suse.com

- Update to version 2.5.0.1
  * The cache manager function `FTC_Manager_Reset'  didn't flush the
    cache.
  * Behdad Esfahbod  (on behalf  of Google) contributed  support for
    color embedded bitmaps (eg. color emoji).
  * The  old FreeType  CFF engine  is now  disabled by  default.
  * All code related to macro FT_CONFIG_OPTION_OLD_INTERNALS
    has been removed.
  * The  property API  (`FT_Property_Get' and  `FT_Property_Set') is
    now declared as stable.
  * Another round of TrueType subpixel hinting fixes.
  * 64bit compilation of the new CFF engine was buggy.
  * Some fixes to improve robustness in memory-tight situations.
- Add dependency on libpng-devel for color emoji support.
- Drop freetype-new-cff-engine.patch, upstream now.

Fri Jul 29 07:41:28 UTC 2011 - idonmez@novell.com

- Update to version 2.4.6
  * For TrueType based fonts, the ascender and descender values were
    incorrect sometimes  (off by a pixel if the ppem value was not a
    multiple of 5).   Depending on the use you might now  experience
    a different  layout; the  change should  result in  better, more
    consistent line spacing.

    * A rendering regression  for second-order Bézier curves  has been
      fixed, introduced in 2.4.3.
    * If autohinting  is not  explicitly disabled,  FreeType now  uses
      the autohinter if  a TrueType based font doesn't  contain native
      hints.
    * The load flag FT_LOAD_IGNORE_GLOBAL_ADVANCE_WIDTH  has been made
      redundant and  is simply ignored;  this means that FreeType  now
      ignores the global advance width value in TrueType fonts.
    * `FT_Sfnt_Table_Info' can now return the number of SFNT tables of
       a font.
    * Support for PCF files compressed with bzip2 has been contributed
      by Joel  Klinghed.  To  make this  work, the  OS must  provide a
      bzip2 library.
    * Again some fixes to better handle broken fonts.
    * Some improvements to the B/W rasterizer.
    * Fixes to the cache module to improve robustness.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul 23 12:20:30 CEST 2008 - mfabian@suse.de

- update to 2.3.7. Extract from the docs/CHANGES file:
  • If the library was compiled on an i386 platform using gcc, and
    compiler option -O3 was given, `FT_MulFix' sometimes returned
    incorrect results which could have caused problems with
    `FT_Request_Metrics' and `FT_Select_Metrics', returning an
    incorrect descender size.
  • Pure CFFs without subfonts were scaled incorrectly if the font
    matrix was non-standard.  This bug has been introduced in
    version 2.3.6.
  • The `style_name' field in the `FT_FaceRec' structure often
    contained a wrong value for Type 1 fonts.  This misbehaviour
    has been introduced in version 2.3.6 while trying to fix
    another problem.  [Note, however, that this value is
    informative only since the used algorithm to extract it is
    very simplistic.]
  • Two new macros, FT_OUTLINE_SMART_DROPOUTS and
    FT_OUTLINE_EXCLUDE_STUBS, have been introduced.  Together with
    FT_OUTLINE_IGNORE_DROPOUTS (which was ignored previously) it is
    now possible to control the dropout mode of the `raster' module
    (for B&W rasterization), using the `flags' field in the
    `FT_Outline' structure.
  • The TrueType bytecode interpreter now passes the dropout mode to
    the B&W rasterizer.  This greatly increases the output for small
    ppem values of many fonts like `pala.ttf'.
  • A bunch of potential security problems have been found.  All
    users should update.
  • Microsoft Unicode cmaps in TrueType fonts are now always
    preferred over Apple cmaps.  This is not a bug per se, but there
    exist some buggy fonts created for MS which have broken Apple
    cmaps.  This affects only the automatic selection of FreeType;
    it's always possible to manually select an Apple Unicode cmap if
    desired.
  • Many bug fixes to the TrueType bytecode interpreter.
  • Improved Mac support.
  • Subsetted CID-keyed CFFs are now supported correctly.
  • CID-keyed CFFs with subfonts which are scaled in a non-standard
    way are now handled correctly.
  • A call to FT_Open_Face with `face_index' < 0 crashed FreeType if
    the font was a Windows (bitmap) FNT/FON.
  • The new function `FT_Get_CID_Registry_Ordering_Supplement' gives
    access to those fields in a CID-keyed font.  The code has been
    contributed by Derek Clegg.
  • George Williams contributed code to validate the new `MATH'
    OpenType table (within the `otvalid' module).  The `ftvalid'
    demo program has been extended accordingly.
  • An API for cmap 14 support (for Unicode Variant Selectors, UVS)
    has been contributed by George Williams.
  • A new face flag FT_FACE_FLAG_CID_KEYED has been added, together
    with a macro FT_IS_CID_KEYED which evaluates to 1 if the font is
    CID-keyed.
  • Build support for symbian has been contributed.
  • Better WGL4 glyph name support, contributed by Sergey Tolstov.
  • Debugging output of the various FT_TRACEX macros is now sent to
    stderr.
  • The `ftview' demo program now provides artificial slanting too.
  • The `ftvalid' demo program has a new option `-f' to select the
    font index.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul 03 16:19:11 CEST 2007 - mfabian@suse.de

- update to 2.3.5. Extract from the doc/CHANGES file:
  • Some subglyphs in TrueType fonts were handled incorrectly due
   to a missing graphics state reinitialization.
  • Large .Z files  (as distributed with some X11  packages)
    weren't handled correctly, making FreeType increase the heap
    stack in an endless loop.
  • A large number of bugs have been fixed to avoid crashes and
    endless loops with invalid fonts.
  • The two new cache functions  `FTC_ImageCache_LookupScaler' and
    `FTC_SBit_Cache_LookupScaler' have been added to allow lookup of
    glyphs using an  `FTC_Scaler' object;  this makes it possible to
    use fractional pixel sizes in the cache.  The demo programs have
    been updated accordingly to use this feature.
  • A new API  `FT_Get_CMap_Format' has been added to  get the
    cmap format  of a  TrueType font.   This  is useful  in handling
    PDF files. The code has been contributed by Derek Clegg.
  • The  auto-hinter now  produces better output by default for
    non-Latin scripts like Indic.  This was done by using the CJK
    hinting module as the default instead of the Latin one. Thanks
    to Rahul Bhalerao for this suggestion.
  • A new API `FT_Face_CheckTrueTypePatents' has been added to find
    out whether a given TrueType font uses patented bytecode
    instructions.  The `ft2demos' bundle contains a new program
    called `ftpatchk' which demonstrates its usage.
  • A new API `FT_Face_SetUnpatentedHinting' has been added to
    enable or disable the unpatented hinter.
  • Support for Windows FON files in PE format has been contributed
    by Dmitry Timoshkov.

- Bugzilla #273714: ('¼', '½', and  '¾' in "Albany AMT" are
  rendered very badly): apply fix from upstream CVS, thanks
  to Werner LEMBERG.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr 10 16:42:14 CEST 2007 - mfabian@suse.de

- update to 2.3.4. Extract from the doc/CHANGES file:
  • A serious bug in the handling of bitmap fonts (and bitmap
    strikes of outline fonts) has been introduced in 2.3.3.
  • Remove a serious regression in the TrueType bytecode
    interpreter that was introduced in version 2.3.2.  Note that
    this does not disable the improvements introduced to the
    interpreter in version 2.3.2, only some ill cases that occurred
    with certain fonts (though a few popular ones).
  • The auto-hinter now ignores single-point contours for
    computing blue zones.  This bug created `wavy' baselines when
    rendering text with various fonts that use these contours to
    model mark-attach points (these are points that are never
    rasterized and are placed outside of the glyph's real
    outline).
  • The `rsb_delta' and `lsb_delta' glyph slot fields are now set
    to 0 for mono-spaced fonts.  Otherwise code that uses them
    would essentially ruin the fixed-advance property.
  • Fix CVE-2007-1351 which can cause an integer overflow while
    parsing BDF fonts, leading to a potentially exploitable heap
    overflow condition.
  • FreeType returned incorrect kerning information from TrueType
    fonts when the bytecode interpreter was enabled.  This
    happened due to a typo introduced in version 2.3.0.
  • Negative kerning values from PFM files are now reported
    correctly (they were read as 16-bit unsigned values from the
    file).
  • Fixed a small memory leak when `FT_Init_FreeType' failed for
    some reason.
  • The Postscript hinter placed and sized very thin and ghost
    stems incorrectly.
  • The TrueType bytecode interpreter has been fixed to get rid
    of most of the rare differences seen in comparison to the
    Windows font loader.
  • A new demo program `ftdiff' has been added to compare
    TrueType hinting, FreeType's auto hinting, and rendering
    without hinting in three columns.
  • The auto-hinter now better deals with serifs and corner cases
    (e.g., glyph '9' in Arial at 9pt, 96dpi).  It also improves
    spacing adjustments and doesn't change widths for non-spacing
    glyphs.

  + amount of heap memory used is drastically reduced
  For more details see /usr/share/doc/packages/freetype2/CHANGES.
- disable freetype-autohint-cjkfonts.patch for the moment, the
  auto-hinter has been replaced with a new module called the
  'auto-fitter' which is "prepared better to support non-latin1
  scripts in next releases". Currently the rendering quality of
  CJK fonts seems to have suffered though compared to 2.1.9
  with the freetype-autohint-cjkfonts.patch.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 24 01:14:22 CET 2004 - mfabian@suse.de

- Add ft2-stream-compat.diff for binary compatibility when
  upgrading from SLES8 to SLES9.
  The FT_Stream functions have been renamed and although these
  functions were declared for internal use only by the freetype
  developers, they have been used in Qt (and possibly elsewhere).
  Therefore, 3rd party which linked statically against Qt might
  not work after upgrading from SLES8 to SLES9.
  Fix this problem with a patch by Kurt Garloff <garloff@suse.de>
  which defines appropriate weak symbols.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

  WEIGHT_NAME and SLANT case insensitively. Without that,
  these properties are not correctly recognized when the fonts
  specify them in lower case.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar  7 21:58:14 CET 2003 - mfabian@suse.de

- Bug #24755: further improvement: add " Wide" to the family name
  for fonts which have an average width >= point size, i.e. fonts
  which have glyphs which are at least square (or maybe even
  wider). This makes fonts which contain only double width
  characters (for example the "misc-fixed" 18x18ja.bdf) clearly
  distinct from single width fonts of the same family and
  avoids that they get accidentally selected via freetype2/Xft2.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar  7 16:06:11 CET 2003 - mfabian@suse.de

- Bug #24775: partly fixed by a patch to freetype which returns
  "FOUNDRY FAMILY_NAME" as the family_name for bitmap fonts.
  Without that change, all bitmap fonts which have "Fixed"
  in FAMILY_NAME also had the same family_name "Fixed" via
  freetype/Xft2 and it was not possible to distinguish between
  them, therefore the selection of "Fixed" bitmap fonts produced
  quite surprising results. After this change, the fonts show
  up for example as "Misc Fixed", "Etl Fixed", etc. via
  freetype2/Xft2, which makes it easy to select the right one.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar  3 12:52:02 CET 2003 - mfabian@suse.de

- fix for the bug that caused FreeType to loop endlessly when
  trying to read certain compressed gzip files. The following test
  could be used to reveal the bug:
  touch 0123456789 ; gzip 0123456789 ; ftdump 0123456789.gz
  (from upstream CVS)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb 14 16:07:55 CET 2003 - mfabian@suse.de

- freetype-bdf-pcf-drivr.patch: use FT_UShort instead of FT_Short
  for the glyph number of bitmap fonts. The GNU Unicode font
  has 34725 glyphs and because of the usage of signed short
  all glyphs with an index above 2^15 couldn't be displayed.
  Thanks to Gerd Knorr <kraxel@suse.de>.
