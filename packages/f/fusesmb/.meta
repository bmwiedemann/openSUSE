  <title>SMB for FUSE</title>
  <description>SMB for fuse (FUSE) is a filesystem which allows to mount a full
Network Neighborhood with samba (Samba) and other SMB shares. It works
like smbfs, but instead of accessing one share at a time, all computers
and workgroups are accessible at once from a single filesystem mount,
making network browsing just as easy as it is on Windows.</description>
