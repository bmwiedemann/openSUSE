  <title>Icecast/Shoutcast Stream Grabber</title>
  <description>fIcy is a command line icecast/shoutcast stream grabber. Its goal is to cleanly
and automatically rip a stream into user-customizable files. It will work with
any ICY-compatible stream, allowing you to either to save the stream to disk,
pipe the output to a media player, or both.
