- Update to version 1.0.21
  * fIcy can now append to output files directly using -A.
  * Error messages about missing or incompatible flags are now
    clearer.
  version 1.0.20:
  * fPls accepts more (broken) EXTM3U files.
  * fIcy output file (-o) is no longer overwritten if -n is
    requested without metadata-based splitting.
  * fIcy output file is now correctly not interrupted if titles
    are requested without flags affecting filename generation (-t, -E
    or -m).
  * fIcy now builds fine by default on systems using gcc 4.7.
  * Support for building with pmake under IRIX has been removed.
  version 1.0.19:
  * fPls will now correctly retry loading remote playlists on
    connection timeout/failures according to the requested limit (3 by
    default).
  * fPls/fIcy -T (maximum time) flag now takes connection/retry
    delays into account, ensuring the requested time is never exceeded.
