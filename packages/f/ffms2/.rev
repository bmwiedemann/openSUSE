    <comment>This is a wrapper around FFmpeg libraries that provides frame/sample indexing and workarounds for certain formats, used by software that needs very accurate seeking (such as aegisub).

This package was taken from Packman, with minimal changes.

It should be legally okay, as it only links FFmpeg and contains no support for patented/copyright-protected codecs of its own.</comment>
