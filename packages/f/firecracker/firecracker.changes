- Update firecracker to version 0.19.1:
  Added:
    * New device: virtio-vsock, backed by Unix domain sockets.
    * New command-line parameter for firecracker, named --no-api, which
      will disable the API server thread. Also, when API server is disabled,
      MMDS is no longer available now.
    * New command-line parameter for firecracker, named --config-file, which
      represents the path to a file that contains a JSON which can be used for
      configuring and starting a microVM without sending any API requests.
    * The jailer adheres to the "end of command options" convention, meaning
      all parameters specified after -- are forwarded verbatim to Firecracker.
    * Added KVM_PTP support to the recommended guest kernel config.
    * Added entry in FAQ.md for Firecracker Guest timekeeping.
  Changed:
    * Vsock API call: PUT /vsocks/{id} changed to PUT /vsock and no longer
      appear to support multiple vsock devices. Any subsequent calls to this API
      endpoint will override the previous vsock device configuration.
  Removed:
    * Removed experimental support for vhost-based vsock devices.
    * Removed unused 'Halting' and 'Halted' instance states.

  * Use "rm -f " instead of "rm" to remove spurious files

- Update firecracker to version 0.17.0:
  Added:
    * New API call: PATCH /machine-config/, used to update VM configuration,
      before the microVM boots.
    * Added an experimental swagger definition that includes the specification
      for the vsock API call.
    * Added a signal handler for SIGBUS and SIGSEGV that immediately terminates
      the process upon intercepting the signal.
    * Added documentation for signal handling utilities.
    * Added [alpha] aarch64 support.
    * Added metrics for successful read and write operations of MMDS, Net and
      Block devices.
  Changed:
    * vcpu_count, mem_size_mib and ht_enabled have been changed to be mandatory
      for PUT requests on /machine-config/.
    * Disallow invalid seccomp levels by exiting with error.
  Fixed:
    * Incorrect handling of bind mounts within the jailed rootfs.
    * Corrected the guide for Alpine guest setup.
