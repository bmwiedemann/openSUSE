  <title>Free TrueType Art Fonts</title>
  <description>More than 300 free fonts in True Type format. Most of them are in the
art style and unusable as desktop fonts, but are great for any poster
or illustration.

The fonts are copyrighted under the GPL or a Freeware license, but
donations are requested by the artists. Look in
/usr/share/doc/packages/free-ttf-fonts/ for further information.</description>
