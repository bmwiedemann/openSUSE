Sun Oct 19 06:12:24 UTC 2025 - Mia Herkt <mia@0x0.st>

- Update to version 13.0.1:
User Interface bug fixes:
  * fix: Use scrollHeight for rendered iframe if offsetHeight is
    unavailable
Bug fixes:
  * fix: db.Iterate can miss records, can return records twice
    which caused a data corruption of the secret table in v13.0.0
  * fix: release email links
- Changes in 13.0.0:
Security features:
  * Add configurable global 2FA enforcement
  * migrate action secrets to keying to store them more securely
Breaking features:
  * bump the minimum required Git version from 2.0.0 to 2.34.1
  * Forgejo Actions workflows are verified with a YAML schema and
    common errors such as using an incorrect context
    (e.g. ${{ badcontext.FORGEJO_REPOSITORY }}) or a typo in a
    required keyword (e.g. ruins-on: instead of runs-on:) will be
    reported in the action page and the web page that displays the
    file in the repository. It is recommended to verify existing
    workflows are successfully verified prior to upgrading,
    as explained in the Forgejo runner release notes.
Breaking bug fixes:
  * The artifact-url ouput returned by the upload-artifact@v4
    action can be used to download the artifact. It was previously
    404. To implement this compatibility fix, the web UI URL to
    download artifacts
    (i.e. /{owner}/{repo}/actions/runs/{run_id}/artifacts/{artifact_name})
    now relies on an identifier that is unique accross the
    instance. URLs to download artifacts that were bookmarked or
    copied prior to this change use an id relative to the
    repository and will no longer work. It previously was
    /{owner}/{repo}/actions/runs/{run_index}/artifacts/{artifact_name},
    note the difference between {run_id} and {run_index}.
    The new URL can be obtained again by visiting the parent page,
    which still uses the relative id
    (/{owner}/{repo}/actions/runs/{run_index}).
User Interface features:
  * ability to view previous logs for Actions runs that have been
    retried
  * show CI status on force-pushes
  * improve org header with new noJS dropdown and more
    options
  * improve multiline file preview and anchor detection
  * render ordered checkbox lists with numbers
  * Admin interface for abuse reports
  * show timestamp on release attachments
  * add tag label to commit list view
  * support Markdown editor bold & italic keyboard shortcuts
  * improve rendering commit links for PR commits,
    external repos and diffs
  * add links to assigners in issue comments
  * use simplified visibility label in dashboard orgs
    list
  * improve custom emojis
  * improve the global noJS notice
  * improve display of repo topics
  * add links to review request targets in issue comments
  * improve subscriptions screen filters
  * implement hover for switch
  * Pretty-print commit counts and other numbers
User Interface bug fixes:
  * add markup class to project descriptions
  * make releases filtering responsive
  * reworked file preview placement towards better HTML validity
  * fix alignment of items in tag signature
  * unescape file names in commit hash links
  * visually distinguish the branch name in action description
  * preserved 'Custom access' even after no permissions
  * show participants in mention suggestions in pr review
  * apply background color to wiki content
  * improve signature box responsiveness
  * ignore existence of commits for force pushes
  * make unicode escape work in wiki
  * prevent initial 'blank' display of action logs view,
    remove unnecessary API calls
  * don't allow comment boxes to stretch outside diff boundries
    on small device UI
  * hide edit button on tag releases, improve ghost user display,
    fix tag signature banner
  * resolved 500 error upon clicking 'Clear milestone' button when
    there's no milestones available in Issue page
  * compare branches even with pull requests disabled
Features:
  * Uploaded avatar images can sometimes contain unexpected
    metadata such as the location where the image was created,
    or the device the image was created with, stored in a format
    called EXIF. Forgejo now removes EXIF data when custom user and
    repository images are uploaded in order to reduce the risk of
    personally identifiable information being leaked unexpectedly.
    A new CLI subcommand forgejo doctor avatar-strip-exif can be
    used to strip EXIF information from all existing avatars; we
    recommend that administrators run this command once after
    upgrade in order to minimize this risk for existing stored
    files.

Sat Nov 16 03:16:51 UTC 2024 - Richard Rahl <rrahl0@opensuse.org>

- update to 9.0.2:
  * it was possible to use a token sent via email for secondary email validation
    to reset the password instead. In other words, a token sent for a given
    action (registration, password reset or secondary email validation) could
    be used to perform a different action.
  * a fork of a public repository would show in the list of forks, even if its
    owner was not a public user or organization.
  * the members of an organization team with read access to a repository (e.g.
    to read issues) but no read access to the code could read the RSS or atom
    feeds which include the commit activity. Reading the RSS or atom feeds is
    now denied unless the team has read permissions on the code.
  * the tokens used when replying by email to issues or pull requests were
    weaker than the rfc2104 recommendations.
  * a registered user could modify the update frequency of any push mirror.
  * it was possible to use basic authorization (i.e. user:password) for requests
    to the API even when security keys were enrolled for a user.
  * some markup sanitation rules were not as strong as they could be.
  * when Forgejo is configured to enable instance wide search (e.g. with bleve),
    results found in the repositories of private or limited users were displayed
    to anonymous visitors.
  * fix: handle renamed dependency for cargo registry.
  * support www.github.com for migrations.
  * move forgot_password-link to fix login tab order.
  * code owners will not be mentioned when a pull request comes from a forked
    repository.
  * labels are missing in the pull request payload removing a label.
  * in a Forgejo Actions workflow, the unlabeled event type for pull requests
    was incorrectly mapped to the labeled event type.
  * when a Forgejo Actions issue or pull request workflow is triggered by an
    labeled or unlabeled event type, it misses information about the label added
    or removed. It is now available in the label data member of the event payload.
  * pull request workflow must always update the head SHA commit status.
  * fix git-grep for code search when git version is below 2.38.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 28 17:09:05 UTC 2024 - Richard Rahl <rrahl0@opensuse.org>

- update to 9.0.1:
  * Forgejo generates a token which is used to authenticate web endpoints that
    are only meant to be used internally, for instance when the SSH daemon is
    used to push a commit with Git. The verification of this token was not done
    in constant time and was susceptible to timing attacks.
  * Because of a missing permission check, the branch used to propose a pull
    request to a repository can always be deleted by the user performing the merge.
  * Fix boolean inputs in workflow_dispatch
  * package arch database not updating when uploading "any" architecture
  * correct SQL query for active issues
  * specify default value for EXPLORE_DEFAULT_SORT.
  * fix: Add recentupdated as recognized sort option
  * Update dependency mermaid to v11.3.0 (v9.0/forgejo)
  * Always update expiration time when creating an artifact
  * Update scheduled tasks even if changes are pushed by "ActionsUser"
  * Fix disable 2fa bug
  * i18n: update of translations from Codeberg Translate
  * fix: make branch protection work for new branches
  * link to security policy in security.txt
  * fix: don't show truncated comments in RSS/Atom feeds
  * fix: typo on releases for source code downloads
  * Revert "add gap between branch dropdown and PR button"
  * fix: Don't double escape delete branch text
  * fix: Add server logging for OAuth server errors
  * forgejo-cli is now a symlink and cannot be used for sanity checks
  * fix: correct documentation for non 200 responses in swagger
- forgejo is since 9.0.0 GPL-3.0-or-later

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct 17 14:52:33 UTC 2024 - Richard Rahl <rrahl0@opensuse.org>

- update to 8.0.2:
  * Overflow for images on project cards.
  * Allow unreacting from comment popover.
  * The scope of application tokens is not verified when writing
    containers or Conan packages.
  * When a Forgejo Actions workflow includes a workflow_dispatch with
    inputs and other events (for instance push), it is silently ignored
    because of a parsing error.

  * Add missing repository type filter parameters to pager.
  * Reverted a change from Gitea which prevented allow/reject reviews on
    merged or closed PRs. This change was not considered by the Forgejo
    UI team and there is a consensus that it feels like a regression,
    since it interferes with workflows known to be used by Forgejo users
    without providing a tangible benefit.
  * Run full PR checks on AGit push.
  * Updated translations

Fri Aug  9 21:25:45 UTC 2024 - Richard Rahl <rrahl0@opensuse.org>

- update to 8.0.1:
  * A change introduced in Forgejo v1.21 allows a Forgejo user with write
    permission on a repository description to inject a client-side script into
    the web page viewed by the visitor. This XSS allows for href in anchor
    elements to be set to a javascript: URI in the repository description,
    which will execute the specified script upon clicking (and not upon
    loading). AllowStandardURLs is now called for the repository description
    policy, which ensures that URIs in anchor elements are mailto:, http:// 
    or https:// and thereby disallowing the javascript: URI.
  * Do not include trailing EOL character when counting lines
  * Add background to reactions on hover
  * Prevent uppercase in header of dashboard context selector
  * Fix page layout in admin settings
  * Ensure all filters are persistent in issue filters
  * Allow 4 charachter SHA in /src/commit

    * add Reviewed-on and Reviewed-by variables to the merge template
    * display an error when an issue comment is edited simultaneously by
      two users instead of silently overriding one of them
    * when installing Forgejo through the built-in installer, open
      (self-) registration is now disabled by default
    * add support for the reddit and Hubspot OAuth providers.

  This is a security release. See the documentation for more
  information on the upgrade procedure.
  * Security
    - A change introduced in Forgejo v1.21 allows a Forgejo user
      with write permission on a repository description to inject a
      client-side script into the web page viewed by the visitor.
      This XSS allows for href in anchor elements to be set to a
      javascript: URI in the repository description, which will
      execute the specified script upon clicking (and not upon
      loading). AllowStandardURLs is now called for the repository
      description policy, which ensures that URIs in anchor
      elements are mailto:, http:// or https:// and thereby
      disallowing the javascript: URI.
  * Bug fixes

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jun 16 12:52:27 UTC 2024 - Richard Rahl <rrahl0@disroot.org>

- update to 7.0.4:
  * Fixed: CVE-2024-24789: the archive/zip package's handling of certain types
    of invalid zip files differs from the behavior of most zip implementations.
    This misalignment could be exploited to create an zip file with contents that
    vary depending on the implementation reading the file.
  * the OAuth2 implementation does not always require authentication for public
    clients, a requirement of RFC 6749 Section 10.2
  * forgejo migrate-storage --type actions-artifacts always fails because it picks the wrong path.
  * avatar files can be found in storage while they do not exist in the database.
  * repository admins are always denied the right to force merge and instance admins
    are subject to restrictions to merge that must only apply to repository admins.
  * non conformance with the Nix tarball fetcher immutable link protocol.
  * migrated activities (such as reviews) are mapped to the user who initiated the
    migration rather than the Ghost user, if the external user cannot be mapped to a
    local one. This mapping mismatch leads to internal server errors in some cases.
  *  a v7.0.0 regression causes [admin].SEND_NOTIFICATION_EMAIL_ON_NEW_USER=true to always be ignored.
  * using a subquery for user deletion is a performance bottleneck when using mariadb 10
    because only mariadb 11 takes advantage of the available index.
  * a v7.0.3 regression causes the expanding diffs in pull requests to fail with a 404 error.
  * SourceHut Builds webhook fail when the triggers field is used.
  * the label list rendering in the issue and pull request timeline is displayed on
    multiple lines instead of a single one.
  * Git hooks of this repository seem to be broken." warning when pushing more than one branch at a time.
  * automerge does not happen when the approval count reaches the required threshold.
  * the FORCE_PRIVATE=true setting is not consistently enforced.
  * CSRF validation errors when OAuth is not enabled.
  * headlines in rendered org-mode do not have a margin on the top

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 22 20:41:58 UTC 2024 - Richard Rahl <rrahl0@disroot.org>

- update to 7.0.3:
  * CVE-2024-24788: a malformed DNS message in response to a query can
    cause the lookup functions to get stuck in an infinite loop
  * backticks in mermaid block diagram labels are not sanitized properly
  * migration of a repository from gogs fails when it is hosted at a subpath.
  * when creating an OAuth2 application the redirect URLs are not enforced to
    be mandatory

  * repository activity feeds (including RSS and Atom feeds) contain
    repeated activities
  * uploading maven packages with metadata being uploaded separately will fail

  * inline emails attachments are not properly handled when commenting on an
    issue via email
  * the links to .zip and tar.gz on the tag list web UI fail
  * expanding code diff while previewing a pull request before it is created fails
  * the CLI is not able to migrate Forgejo Actions artifacts

  * when using reverse proxy authentication, logout will not be taken into
    account when immediately trying to login afterwards
  * pushing to the master branch of a sha256 repository fails
  * a very long project column name will make the action menu inaccessible
  * a useless error is displayed when the title of a merged pull request is
    modified
  * workflow badges are not working for workflows that are not running on push
    (such as scheduled workflows, and ones that run on tags and pull requests)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May  3 00:35:37 UTC 2024 - Richard Rahl <rrahl0@disroot.org>

- update to 7.0.2:
  * regression where subscribing to or unsubscribing from an issue in a
    repository with no code produced an internal server error.
  * regression makes all the refs sent in Gitea webhooks to be full refs and
    might break Woodpecker CI pipelines triggered on tag (CI_COMMIT_TAG
    contained the full ref). This issue has been fixed in the main branch of
    Woodpecker CI as well.
  *  the webhook branch filter wrongly applied the match on the full ref for
     branch creation and deletion (wrongly skipping events).
  * toggling the WIP state of a pull request is possible from the sidebar,
    but not from the footer.
  * when mentioning a user, the markup post-processor does not handle the case
    where the mentioned user does not exist: it tries to skip to the next node,
    which in turn, ended up skipping the rest of the line.
  * excessive and unnecessary database queries when a user with no repositories
    is viewing their dashboard.
  * duplicate status check contexts show in the branch protection settings.
  * profile info fails to render german singular translation.
  * inline attachments of incoming emails (as they occur for example with Apple
    Mail) are not attached to comments.
