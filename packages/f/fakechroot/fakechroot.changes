- add fakechroot-glibc-233.patch to fix glibc 2.33 compatibility

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May  6 08:55:45 UTC 2020 - Martin Pluskal <mpluskal@suse.com>

- Update to version 2.20.1
  * Fixed problem when tests couldn't be started with root user and
    glibc 2.28.
  * Fixed problem with too verbose test for debootstrap(8) command.
  * Fixed problem with tests for fts_* functions when started on
    btrfs filesystem.
  - The debootstrap(8) command honors FAKECHROOT_EXTRA_LIBRARY_PATH
    environment variable too.
  * Workaround has been added for systemd package installed by
    debootstrap(8) command.
  * Better support for link-time optimizer.
- Changes for version 2.20:
  * The fts64_* functions were added: glibc supports them since
    2.23.
  * The renameat2(2) function were added: glibc supports it since
    2.28 and mv command from coreutils 8.30 uses it.
  * The chroot(8) wrapper and fakechroot(1) command can work with
    POSIX shell.
  * The chroot(8) wrapper allows to chroot into root directory.
  * The chroot(8) wrapper appends directories from
  * FAKECHROOT_EXTRA_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable because some
    commands use runpath. The default value is
    /lib/systemd:/usr/lib/man-db forsystemctl(1) and man(1)
    commands.
  * The ldd(1) wrapper doesn't lose a leading slash in absolute
    paths.
  * The fakechroot(1) command unsets CDPATH environment variable
    and swaps libfakeroot and libfakechroot in LD_PRELOAD
    environment variable if needed.
  * Can be compiled with gcc 7.1 -Wformat-truncation.
  * Can be compiled with clang 5.0 -O2 and -std=c11.

    elements.

    directory outside of fakechroot.
  * The fakechroot(1) command sets FAKECHROOT_CMD_ORIG environment
    variable for wrapped command.
  * The ldd(1) wrapper distinguishes different paths with the same
    beginning.
  * The ldd(1) wrapper does not fail if the path is not existing
    outside fakechroot.
