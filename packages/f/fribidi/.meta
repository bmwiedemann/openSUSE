  <title>Free Implementation of BiDi Algorithm</title>
  <description>This library implements the algorithm as described in the &quot;Unicode
Standard Annex #9, the Bidirectional Algorithm,
http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr9/&quot;. FriBidi is exhaustively
tested against the Bidi Reference Code and, to the best of the
developers' knowledge, does notcontain any conformance bugs.

The API was inspired by the document &quot;Bi-Di languages support - BiDi
API proposal&quot; by Franck Portaneri, which he wrote as a proposal for
adding BiDi support to Mozilla.</description>
