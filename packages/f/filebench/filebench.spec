%description
Filebench is a file system and storage benchmark that allows to generate a
large variety of workloads. Unlike typical benchmarks it is very flexible and
allows to minutely specify (any) applications' behaviour using extensive
Workload Model Language (WML). Filebench uses loadable workload personalities
to allow easy emulation of complex applications (e.g., mail, web, file, and
database servers). Filebench is quick to set up and easy to use compared to
deploying real applications. It is also a handy tool for micro-benchmarking.
