README.SUSE file for package flex
---------------------------------

This version of the flex program (developed at http://lex.sourceforge.net/) is
a major upgrade of the original flex maintained at
http://www.gnu.org/software/flex/ and has some incompatible changes in the
generated scanners. For that reason, we temporarily ship the package flex-old,
which contains the original version.
