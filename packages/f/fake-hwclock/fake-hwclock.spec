%description
Some machines don't have a working realtime clock (RTC) unit, or no
driver for the hardware that does exist. fake-hwclock is a simple set
of scripts to save the kernel's current clock periodically (including
at shutdown) and restore it at boot so that the system clock keeps at
least close to realtime. This will stop some of the problems that may
be caused by a system believing it has travelled in time back to
1970, such as needing to perform filesystem checks at every boot.

On top of this, use of NTP is still recommended to deal with the fake
clock "drifting" while the hardware is halted or rebooting.
