- Version update to 1.10

  Engine Features
  * The configuration menu has been redesigned and is now used as the pause menu.
  * The interface features from version 1.09 have been reverted due to being 
    accessible from the pause menu.
  * Added an Interface option to disable showing hidden entity markers.
  * Support floating point values for loot drop chance values.
  * Add ‘hide_timeout’ option to stat bar configuration to support auto-hiding.
  * Added an Interface option to disable stat bar auto-hiding globally.
  * Add ‘no_stash’ property to item definitions to prevent items from being 
    placed in the stash.
  * Add low HP notification system. (Leszek Cimała)
  * Add ability to change the minimap zoom level by clicking on the minimap.

  Engine Fixes
  * Fixed event activation being tied to distance to the camera position. It is 
    now correctly tied to distance from the player.
  * Mouse movement and mouse aim now calculate direction relative to the player 
    instead of relative to the screen.
  * Fixed enemy AI so that enemies can now enter combat if a hero ally is in 
    their proximity.

  * Fixed dialog not being available if it lacked a topic.

    low.
  * Fix bug where the wrong requirements were checked for passive powers that 
    had been granted bonus points.
  * Items that can’t be stashed are now dropped on the ground upon opening the 
    stash.
  * Prevent re-binding the primary Main1 binding, which could break many 
    interactions.
  * Removed the ability to re-bind the Ctrl, Shift, Alt, and Delete keys, since 
    they correspond to specific keyboard keys.
  * Fix crash when trying to load a mod that contained 
    ‘engine/default_keybindings.txt’.
  * Display XP stat bar value as relative to current level instead of total XP.
  * Fix key bindings not working when switched to a non-US keyboard layout.
  * Fix segfault when NPC filename is invalid.
  * Fix inventory tooltips covering books when using no mouse.
  * Fix navigation of dialog menu when using no mouse.
  * Fix upgrading powers when using no mouse.
  * When using the sdl_hardware renderer on Windows, OpenGL will now be used 
    instead of Direct3D. This fixes the loss of some textures when resizing 
    the window.
  * Fixed the “level up” string to represent the ability to allocate multiple 
    stat points. Also note if Power points can be allocated.
  * Refactored ‘requires_hpmp_state’ for Powers to check against both stats at 
    once. See the attribute reference for syntax changes.
  * Greatly improved performance of loot tooltips.
  * Fix bug where high item find chance prevented the player from finding 
    currency.
