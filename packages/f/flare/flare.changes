Sat Feb  5 15:56:05 UTC 2022 - Carsten Ziepke <kieltux@gmail.com>

- Version update to 1.13
  Engine features
  * Added additional requirement properties (requires_status, 
    requires_item, etc) to enemy and NPC map objects. The properties 
    now match what is available for map events.
  * When ‘mouse aim’ is disabled, the Shift key can now be used with 
    the direction keys to change the player’s orientation without 
    moving.
  * Added optional ‘fog-of-war’ feature
  * Added support for multiple sets/loadouts of equipped items
  * Added random_status attribute to Events for setting/unsetting a 
    random status from a list.
  * Reworked gamepad handling using the SDL_GameController API.
  * Several new key bindings, many of which will benefit gamepad 
    users.
  * Added an “action picker” for interacting with items/powers when 
    using a gamepad or a touchscreen.
  * Added misc.selection_rect_corner_size to 
    engine/widget_settings.txt. This allows for a nicer “targeting 
    reticle” appearance when selecting widgets without a mouse.

    the existing hard-coded filenames if this property is omitted.
  * Added ‘close’, ‘label_title’, and ‘action_list’ properties to 
    MenuConfirm configuration.
  * Added ‘render_layers’ section to StatBlock definitions. It has the 
    same syntax and functionality as engine/hero_layers.txt, so that 
    file is now considered deprecated.
  * Added ‘animation_slots’ section to StatBlock definitions. This 
    allows for multiple animation layers on non-player entities that 
    don’t have an inventory like the player.
  * Added a ‘direction’ property to map NPCs, indentical to the 
    property of the same name for map enemies.
  * Added ‘vendor_ratio_buy’, ‘vendor_ratio_sell’, and 
   ‘vendor_ratio_sell_old’ properties to engine/loot.txt. These 
   deprecate ‘vendor_ratio’ and ‘vendor_ratio_buyback’.
  * Added ‘vendor_ratio_buy’, ‘vendor_ratio_sell’, and 
    ‘vendor_ratio_sell_old’ properties to NPCs. These can be used to 
    override the global settings in engine/loot.txt.
  * Added ‘tooltip_visible_max’ to engine/tootlips.txt to control the 
    maximum number of visible floating tooltips.
    
  Engine fixes
  * Fix enemies not being able to target NPC followers
  * Fix loot and sound effects being cleared in StatBlock files with 
    multiple sections

    of Character menu.

    100% full.
  * Fix bug where negative regen would overflow after reaching zero.
  * Fix bug that caused built-in effect types to be ignored by Power 
    post_effect.

  * Fading of corpses is now correctly disabled when corpse_timeout=0 
    is used in engine/misc.txt.
  * Fix cast animation not playing when using an inventory item that 
    is not instant.
  * Fixed a bug on Android where loading the default settings would 
    exit fullscreen mode.
  * Fixed crash in NPC dialog when using gamepad.
  * Fixed several small bugs with navigating UI elements with a 
    gamepad.
  * Fixed incorrect handling of gamepad stick/trigger deadzone.
  * Fixed fullscreen setting being turned off when loading 
    configuration defaults on Android.
  * Fixed input hint for item tooltips when using a touchscreen.
  * Improved file access handling on Android versions 10 and up. This 
    fixes the infinite cutscene loop when starting a new game.

   ‘critdie’ isn’t defined.
  * Improved text rendering by blending text with a copy of itself.
  * Fix infinite loop that could occur when setting unlocked powers.
  * Elemental resistances can now be used with ‘stat’, 
   ‘stat_per_level’, and ‘stat_per_primary’ in StatBlock definitions.

    via the pause menu. (m7600)

    giving the options to exit or respawn (if applicable).

  * Added ‘–safe-video’ command line option. For troubleshooting purposes, this

    Power property ‘target_categories’ can now be used for the player as a result.

    same as ‘on_trigger’, except the event can ONLY be activated through the hotspot.
  * Support an arbitrary number of Stash tabs. Each tab has a display name and
    an ‘is_private’ flag.
  * Added ‘save_onstash’ property to engine/misc.txt, so it is now possible to
    disable the automatic save when modifying stash contents.
