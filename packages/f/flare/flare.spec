%description
Flare (Free Libre Action Roleplaying Engine) is a game engine built
to handle a very specific kind of game: single-player 2D action RPGs.
Flare is not a reimplementation of an existing game or engine. It is a
tribute to and exploration of the action RPG genre.

The usecase of this project is to build several real games and
reuse code. The first game, in progress, is a fantasy dungeon crawl.

Flare uses .ini-style config files for most of the
game data to modify game contents. The game code is C++.
