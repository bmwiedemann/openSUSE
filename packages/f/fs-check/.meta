  <title>Check File System Usage</title>
  <description>fs-check checks file system sizes to see if they are getting too full.
It uses a configuration file that specifies the file systems to check,
e-mail contacts, trigger thresholds (percentage or amount used and
unused), and a report program to run. It includes fs-report, which
shows things like the largest files, the newest files, and core files.
It can be run from cron or as a daemon.</description>
