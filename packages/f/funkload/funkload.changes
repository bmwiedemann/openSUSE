- replaced source archive location from pypi to github as package contain
  documentation which pypi version does not have.
- updated to release 1.17.1 
  * Add a discover mode to the bench runner, so fl-run-bench can be
    invoked without specifying the particular test case. This implementation
    attempts to behave like unittest’s ‘discover’ argument, and there is
    even a similar –failfast option.
  * Support https proxy (http proxy was already supported)
  * Add a midCycle hook to execute an action in the middle of a cycle
  * Add -L options to fl-record to enable tcpwatch forwarded mode which
    is usefull if you have an http_proxy to pass.
  * Add –quiet option to fl-build-report to remove warning in rst to html convertion
  * GH-71: zeromq-based publisher that will let each node
    publish in realtime the tests results
  * GH-68: Use lightweight threads (greenlets) if available.
  * Added one more RPS chart in Section 5, where the X-axis
    represents time(in second) and the Y-axis represents RPS.
  * Added support for providing the test configuration file with –config
  * Display the description in the URL when rendering the page in Firefox
  * GH-41: Allow fl-run-bench to take modules in addition to filenames 
  * Support for gzip compression
  * Experimental comet request support, handle stream request in a separate thread
  * Ability to configure multiple benchers per server in distribute mode
  * Ability to configure multiple monitors per server (useful if you have
    to use ssh tunnels instead of read hostnames).

- changes from 1.16.0:
  * extends HTTP methods with HEAD and OPTIONS, enable to send any methods
    using the new "method" API, adding PROPFIND DAV example
  * GH-9: new options for distributed mode: you can specify the Python binary
    to use with ``--distribute-python=PYTHON_BIN`` option and additional
    packages to install on slaves with the
    ``--distributed-packages=DISTRIBUTED_PACKAGES`` option
  * GH-9: added the ability to monitor hosts from the central host; the
    monitoring will also retroactively match up the concurrent users for
    graphing purposes
  * GH-5: ``fl-record`` now checks for ``tcpwatch`` command in addition to
    ``tcpwatch.py`` and ``tcpwatch-httpproxy``
  * GH-6: filter out .swfs when building funkload tests with ``fl-record``
  * GH-10: support of python2.7
  * GH-15: exposed the load_auto_links parameter to the get/put/post/method
    methods so that the option to not parse the payload is available when
    writing a test
  * fix org-mode output for Org 7.5, adding missing monitoring section
  * GH-14: fix report creation when having error message with non-us characters
  * GH-11: handling of deleted cookies
  * GH-7: data and demo directory missing

- changes from 1.15.0:
  * now supporting emacs Org-mode_ text format as report output; this enables
    to edit a report as plain text and to produce professional PDF reports
    througth the Org-mode_ LaTeX export
  * new `trend report to display evolution of performances over time; just use
    the ``--trend`` option of the ``fl-build-report`` command
  * the credential server can serve a sequence; using ``xmlrpc_get_seq``
    threads can share a sequence
  * removing deprecated gdchart support, now relying only on gnuplot; note that
    a mathplotlib support is on the TODO list
