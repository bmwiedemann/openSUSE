- update to 1.6:
  * Eliminated the dependency on `pandoc` for installing the
    manual page.
  * Updated the documentation to reflect recent kernel changes,
    including the kernel adding support for more Merkle tree
    block sizes, IMA adding support for fs-verity, and btrfs
    adding support for fs-verity.
  * Updated the documentation to refer to the new fsverity
    mailing list.
  * Fixed a C++ compatibility issue in `libfsverity.h`.
  * `fsverity measure` now follows standard command line syntax
    for arguments beginning with hyphens.  I.e.,
    `fsverity measure --foo` now treats `--foo` as
  * an (unsupported) option, not a filename.  To operate on a
    file actually named `--foo`, use `fsverity measure -- --foo`.
