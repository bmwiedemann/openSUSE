    <comment>- Update to 2.0.11:
  * Provide a much more detailed error report, including recommended
    solutions, when character encoding problems hit.
    As Python3 has slowly gained in popularity, its failure to provide
    useful built-ins to handle real-world character encoding problems
    hurts more people. (E.g., many files don't comply with *any*
    character set encoding standard, and Python3 can't read them
    without enabling options that are wrong for others.)
    We can at least provide much more detailed feedback to help
    explain the various options available.</comment>
