  <description>FLoM is a free open source distributed lock manager that can be used to
synchronize shell commands, scripts and custom developed software. When used
in a shell environment, FLoM manages process synchronization in the same way
that &quot;nice&quot; manages process prioritization. Supports networking, abstract
resources, offers a library, encryption and peer authentication.
