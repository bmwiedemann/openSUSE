- disable parental controls for now by using '-Dmalcontent=disabled', to work around
  issues with xdg-desktop-portal

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr 19 08:05:28 UTC 2024 - Robert Frohl <rfrohl@suse.com>

- Update to version 1.15.8:
  + Security fixes:
    - Don't allow an executable name to be misinterpreted as a
      command-line option for bwrap(1). This prevents a sandbox
      escape where a malicious or compromised app could ask
      xdg-desktop-portal to generate a .desktop file with access to
      files outside the sandbox. (CVE-2024-32462, boo#1223110).
  + Other bug fixes:
    - Pass the -export-dynamic linker option as
      -Wl,-export-dynamic, fixing build failures with clang 18 and
      lld 18.
    - Fix a double-free when installation is cancelled.
    - Fix installed-tests failure with "FUSERMOUNT: unbound
      variable".
- Changes from version 1.15.7:
  + New features:
    - Automatically remove obsolete driver versions and other
      autopruned refs.
    - --socket=inherit-wayland-socket.
    - Automatically reload D-Bus session bus configuration after
      installing or upgrading apps, to pick up any exported D-Bus
      services.
  + Bug fixes:
    - Don't parse <developer><name/></developer> as the application
      name.
    - Don't refuse to start apps when there is no D-Bus system bus
      available.
    - Don't try to repeat migration of apps whose data was migrated
      to a new name and then deleted.
    - Improve handling of mixed locales on systems with
      systemd-localed.
    - Improve display of ellipsized columns in wide terminals.
    - Make flatpak info -e look for extensions in all
      installations.
    - Fix warnings from newer GLib versions.
    - Always set the container environment variable.
    - Always let the app inherit redirected file descriptors.
    - In flatpak ps, add xdg-desktop-portal-gnome to the list of
      backends we'll use to learn which apps are running in the
      background.
    - Don't use WAYLAND_SOCKET unless given
      --socket=inherit-wayland-socket.
    - Use fusermount3 if compiled with FUSE 3, overridable with
      -Dsystem_fusermount compile-time option.
    - Avoid leaking a temporary variable from
      /etc/profile.d/flatpak.sh into the shell environment.
    - Improve async-signal safety.
    - Fix various memory leaks.
    - Avoid undefined behaviour of signed left-shift when storing
      object IDs in a hash table.
    - Detect the correct gtk-doc when cross-compiling.
    - Detect the correct wayland-scanner when cross-compiling.
    - Documentation improvements.
    - Skip more tests when FUSE isn't available.
    - Updated translations.
- Add libglnx.patch: fix meson function detection.
- Switch build system to meson:
  + Add meson BuildRequires.
  + Switch configure/make_build/make_install macros to
    meson/meson_build/meson_install, preserving the configure
    parameters as close as possible:
    --disable-silent-rules => obsoleted
    --with-system-bubblewrap => -Dsystem_bubblewrap=bwrap
    --with-curl => -Dhttp_backend=curl
- Add pkgconfig(malcontent-0) BuildRequires: enable malcontent
  support.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov 14 19:34:15 UTC 2023 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.15.6:
  + In distributions that compile Flatpak to use a separate
    bubblewrap (bwrap) executable, version 0.8.0 is now required.
  + Enabling the optional Wayland security context feature requires
    libwayland-client, wayland-scanner >= 1.15 and
    wayland-protocols >= 1.32.
  + Add --device=input, for access to evdev devices in /dev/input
  + Update bundled copy of bubblewrap to version 0.8.0, and rely on
    its features:
  + Improve error message if seccomp is disabled in kernel config
  + Security hardening: set user namespace limit to 0, to prevent
    creation of nested user namespaces in a more robust way
  + For subsandboxes started by flatpak-portal, inherit
    environment variables from the flatpak run that started the
    original instance rather than from flatpak-portal, fixing
    behaviour of FLATPAK_GL_DRIVERS and similar features
  + Stop http transfers if a download in progress becomes very slow
  + Make it easier to configure extra languages, by picking them up
    from AccountsService if configured there
  + Add new flatpak_transaction_add_rebase_and_uninstall() API,
    allowing end-of-life apps to be replaced by their intended
    replacement more reliably
  + Create a private Wayland socket with the "security context"
    extension if available, allowing the compositor to identify
    connections from sandboxed apps as belonging to the sandbox
  + Update libglnx to 2023-08-29
  + Use features of newer GLib versions if available
  + Turn off system-level crash reporting infrastructure during
    some unit tests that involve intentional assertion failures
  + Add anchors to link to sections of flatpak-metadata
    documentation
  + Bug fixes:
    - Avoid warnings processing symbolic links with GLib >= 2.77.0,
      and with GLib 2.76.0 (GLib 2.76.1 or later silences these
      warnings)
    - Bypass page cache for backend requests in revokefs, fixing
      installation errors with libostree 2023.4
    - Show AppStream metadata in flatpak remote-info as intended
    - Don't let Flatpak apps inherit VK_DRIVER_FILES or
      VK_ICD_FILENAMES from the host system, which would be wrong
      for the sandbox
    - Fix build failure with prereleases of libappstream 0.17.x
    - Forward-compatibility with libappstream 1.0
    - Fix installation with Meson if configured with
      -Dauto_sideloading=true
    - Fix a memory leak
    - Fix compiler warnings
    - Make the tests fail more comprehensibly if a required tool is
      missing
    - Clean up /var/tmp/flatpak-cache-* directories on boot
    - Don't force GIO_USE_VFS=local for programs launched via
      flatpak-spawn
    - Clarify documentation for D-Bus name ownership
   + Internal changes:
     - Split up large source files into smaller modules, reducing
       internal circular dependencies
     - Re-synchronize code backported from GLib with the version in
       GLib
     - Clarify documentation for D-Bus name ownership
     - Make the flags used to apply "extra data" clearer
     - Use glnx_opendirat() where possible
  + Updated translations.
- Add pkgconfig(wayland-client), pkgconfig(wayland-scanner) and
  pkgconfig(wayland-protocols) BuildRequires and pass
  with-wayland-security-context=yes to configure: Enable the
  optional Wayland security context.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug  2 20:23:29 UTC 2023 - Luciano Santos <luc14n0@opensuse.org>

- Add update-user-flatpaks service and timer Systemd units - based
  on update-system-flatpaks.{service,timer} - to help users keep
  their user installed flatpaks up to date.
- Prefix /etc/flatpak/remotes.d/flathub.flatpakrepo with %config
  macro to mark it as a configuration file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 17 16:20:57 UTC 2023 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.15.4 (CVE-2023-28101, CVE-2023-28100):
  + Escape special characters when displaying permissions and
    metadata, preventing malicious apps from manipulating the
    appearance of the permissions list using crafted metadata
    (CVE-2023-28101, bsc#1209410).
  + If a Flatpak app is run on a Linux virtual console (tty1, tty2,
    etc.), don't allow copy/paste via the TIOCLINUX ioctl
    (CVE-2023-28100, bsc#1209411). Note that this is specific to virtual
    consoles: Flatpak is not vulnerable to this if run from a
    graphical terminal emulator such as xterm, gnome-terminal or
    Konsole.
  + Document the path used for flatpak override.
  + Updated translations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 17 10:06:34 UTC 2023 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.15.3:
  + Build system: Building this version of Flatpak with Meson is
    recommended. The source release flatpak-1.15.3.tar.xz no longer
    contains Autotools-generated files, although this version can
    still be built using Autotools after running ./autogen.sh.
    Future versions are likely to remove the Autotools buildsystem.
  + Bug fixes:
    - When splitting an upgrade into two steps (download without
      installing, and then upgrade without allowing further
      downloads) like GNOME Software does, if an app is marked EOL
      and superseded by a replacement, don't remove the superseded
      app in the first step, which would result in the replacement
      incorrectly not being installed.
    - Fix a crash when --socket=gpg-agent is used.
    - Fix a crash when listing apps if one of them is broken or
      misconfigured.
    - If an app has invalid syntax in its overrides or metadata,
      mention the filename in the error message.
    - Unset $GDK_BACKEND for apps, ensuring GTK apps with
      --socket=fallback-x11 can work.
    - Fix a deprecation warning when compiled with curl >= 7.85.
  + Updated translations.
  + Internal changes: Better diagnostic messages for why runtimes
    are or are not considered unused.
- Changes from version 1.15.2:
  + Bug fixes:
    - Never try to export a parent of reserved directories as a
      --filesystem, for example /run, which would prevent the app
      from starting.
    - Never try to export a --filesystem below /run/flatpak or
      /run/host, which could similarly prevent the app from
      starting.
    - The above change also fixes apps not starting if a
      --filesystem is a symlink to the root directory.
    - Show a warning when the --filesystem exists but cannot be
      shared with the sandbox.
    - Display the intended messages for flatpak repair.
    - Exporting an app to an existing repository on a CIFS
      filesystem now works as intended.
    - Unset $GIO_EXTRA_MODULES for apps, avoiding misbehaviour in
      some GLib apps when set to a path on the host.
    - Unset $XKB_CONFIG_ROOT for apps, avoiding crashes in GTK and
      Qt apps under Wayland when this variable is set to a path not
      available in the sandbox.
    - When using the fish shell, avoid duplicate XDG_DATA_DIRS
      entries if the profile script is sourced more than once.
    - Update included copy of bubblewrap to 0.7.0 for better error
      messages.
    - Install SELinux files correctly when building with Meson
  + Internal changes:
    - Update included copy of libglnx
    - flatpak -v now uses the INFO log level, and flatpak -vv uses
      the DEBUG log level in the flatpak log domain. Previously,
      the extra messages that were logged by flatpak -vv were in a
      separate "flatpak2" log domain. G_MESSAGES_DEBUG=flatpak
      previously had an effect similar to flatpak -v, and is now
      more similar to flatpak -vv.
- Changes from version 1.15.1:
  + Dependencies: When building with Meson, gpgme 1.8.0 is now
    required. Older versions can still be used by building with
    Autotools.
  + Features: If an old temporary deploy directory was leaked by
    versions before #5146, clean it up the next time the same app
    is updated.
  + Bug fixes:
    - If an app update is blocked by parental controls policies,
      clean up the temporary deploy directory.
    - Fix Autotools build with versions of gpgme that no longer
      provide gpgme-config(1).
    - Fix a possible parallel build failure with Meson.
    - Fix a compiler warning on 32-bit architectures.
    - When building with Autotools, be more consistent about
      applying compiler warning flags.
    - Unset $TEMP, $TEMPDIR and $TMP for apps, the same as $TMPDIR.
    - Treat /efi the same as /boot/efi.
- Changes from version 1.15.0:
  + Build system:
    - Flatpak can now be compiled using Meson instead of Autotools.
      This requires Meson 0.53.0 or later, and Python 3.5 or later.
    - The Autotools build system is likely to be removed during
      either the 1.15.x or 1.17.x cycle.
  + New features:
    - Allow the modify_ldt system call as part of
      --allow=multiarch. This increases attack surface, but is
      required when running 16-bit executables in some versions of
      Wine.
    - Share gssproxy socket, which acts like a portal for Kerberos
      authentication. This lets apps use Kerberos authentication
      without needing a sandbox hole.
    - Add a httpbackend variable to flatpak.pc, allowing dependent
      projects like GNOME Software to detect whether they are
      compatible with libflatpak.
  + Bug fixes:
    - Terminate the flatpak-session-helper and flatpak-portal
      services when the session ends, so that applications will not
      inherit outdated Wayland and X11 socket addresses.
    - When using fish shell, don't overwrite a previously-set
      XDG_DATA_DIRS.
    - Don't try to enable HTTP 2 if linked to a libcurl version
      that doesn't support it.
    - Stop systemd reporting the session-helper as failed when
      terminated by a signal.
    - Fix a warning when listing a document with no permissions.
    - Fix compilation with GLib 2.66.x (as used in Debian 11).
    - Fix compilation with GLib 2.58.x (as used in Debian 10).
    - Make generated files more reproducible.
  + Internal changes:
    - Update project logo in README.
    - Update libglnx subproject.
  + Updated translations.
- Add libtool BuildRequires and pass autogen.sh, bootstrapping
  build is now needed.
- Add gtk-doc and xmlto BuildRequires and pass enable-documentation
  and enable-gtk-doc to configure, building documentation manually.

  + Bug fixes:
    - Display the intended messages for flatpak repair.
    - Exporting an app to an existing repository on a CIFS

  + Allow sub-sandboxes to own MPRIS names on the session bus.
  + Commands that accept "--user" will now also take "-u" as an alias
    for that.
  + The CLI now properly informs the user of which apps are
    (indirectly) using end-of-life runtime extensions in end-of-life
    info messages.
  + The CLI now takes into account operations in the pending
    transaction when printing end-of-life messages.
  + The uninstall command now asks for confirmation before removing
    in-use runtimes or runtime extensions.
  + A "--socket=gpg-agent" option is now recognized by "flatpak run"
    and related commands.
  + Curl supported as default HTTP backend.
  + Uses Fuse 3.

    fixing a regression in 1.12.3

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan 12 20:40:35 UTC 2022 - Andreas Stieger <andreas.stieger@gmx.de>

- Update to 1.12.3:
  + CVE-2021-43860: a malicious repository could have sent invalid
    application metadata in a way that hides some of the app
    permissions displayed during installation (boo#1194610)
  + CVE-2022-21682: flatpak-builder could allow
    --mirror-screenshots-url commands to create directories outside
    of the build directory (boo#1194611)
  + Extra-data downloading now properly handles compressed
    content-encodings which fixes checksum verification 
  + Note: In some corner case server setups this may require the
    extra-data checksum to be changed
  + Avoid unnecessary policy-kit dialog due to auto-pinning when
    installing runtimes
  + Better handling of updates of extensions that exist in multiple
    repositories
  + Fixed (initial) installation apps with renamed ids
  + Fixed regression in updates from no-enumerate remotes
  + We now verify checksums of summary caches, to better handle
    local file corruption
  + Improved cli output for non-terminal targets
  + Flatpak run --session-bus now works
  + Fix build with PyParsing >= 3.0.4
  + Fixed "Since" annotations on FlatpakTransaction signals

- Drop support-new-pyparsing.patch: Fixed upstream.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec  9 04:29:19 UTC 2021 - Steve Kowalik <steven.kowalik@suse.com>

- Add patch support-new-pyparsing.patch:
  * Support pyparsing >= 3.0.4.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct 13 19:26:14 UTC 2021 - Andreas Stieger <andreas.stieger@gmx.de>

  + Install translations referenced by LANG, LANGUAGE or LC_ALL
  + Fix error handling for the syscalls that are blocked when not
    using --devel
  + Improve diagnostic messages when seccomp rules cannot be
    applied
  + Updated translations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Oct  9 12:12:12 UTC 2021 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.12.1:
  + The security fix in the 1.12.0 release failed when used with
    some older versions of libseccomp (that don't know about the
    new syscalls).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct  8 14:39:24 UTC 2021 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.12.0:
  + This is the first stable release in the 1.12.x series. The
    major changes in this series is the support for better control
    of sub-sandboxes, as used by the steam flatpak.
  + In addition, this release fixes a security vulnerability in the
    portal support. Some recently added syscalls were not blocked
    by the seccomp rules which allowed the application to create
    sub-sandboxes which can confuse the sandboxing verification
    mechanisms of the portal. This has been fixed by extending the
    seccomp rules (boo#1191507, CVE-2021-41133)
  + Some test fixes
  + Support for specifying the flatpak binary to use during exports
  + Install translations for all languages in the locale, not just
    the ones in LC_MESSAGES.
  + Fix progress reporting in flatpak fsck
  + Handle cases where /var/tmp is a symlink
  + Expose /etc/gai.conf to the sandbox
  + Fix the parental control checks for root
  + Handle missing /etc/ld.so.cache (musl)
  + Updated translations

  * Bug fixes:
   * Don't inherit an unusual $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR setting into the sandbox,
     fixing a regression introduced when CVE-2021-21261 was fixed in
     1.8.5 and 1.10.0
   * Update the included copy of bubblewrap (flatpak-bwrap) to 0.5.0
     * Better diagnostics when a --bind or other bind-mount fails
     * Create non-directories with safer permissions
     * Allow mounting an non-directory over an existing non-directory
     * Silence kernel messages for our bind-mounts
     * Improve ability to bind-mount directories on case-insensitive
       filesystems

    - Add information about security support and security
      vulnerability reporting (see SECURITY.md)
    - Move all git submodules into subprojects/ directory
    - Several sockets are now created in /run/flatpak in the
      sandbox, with symbolic links in $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 10 14:27:26 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

-  Update to version 1.10.2:

   + Fix memory leaks
   + Some test fixes
   + Documentation updates
   + G_BEGIN/END_DECLS added to library headders for c++ use

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan 15 16:06:24 UTC 2021 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.10.0:
  + The major new feature in this series compared to 1.8 is the
    support for the new repo format which should make updates
    faster and download less data.
  + The systemd generator snippets now call flatpak
    --print-updated-env in place of a bunch of shell for better
    login performance.
  + The .profile snippets now disable GVfs when calling flatpak to
    avoid spawning a gvfs daemon when logging in via ssh.
  + Build fixes for GCC 11.
  + Flatpak now finds the pulseaudio sockets better in uncommon
    configurations.
  + Sandboxes with network access it now also has access to the
    systemd-resolved socket to do dns lookups.
  + Flatpak supports unsetting env vars in the sandbox using
    --unset-env, and --env=FOO= now sets FOO to the empty string
    instead of unsetting it.
  + Similarly the spawn portal has an option to unset an env var.
  + The spawn portal now has an option to share the pid namespace
    with the sub-sandbox.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan 15 16:02:40 UTC 2021 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.8.5 (CVE-2021-21261):
  + This is a security update that fixes a sandbox escape where a
    malicious application can execute code outside the sandbox by
    controlling the environment of the "flatpak run" command when
    spawning a sub-sandbox (boo#1180996)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan  7 20:28:03 UTC 2021 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.8.4:
  + Fix support for ppc64.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- Move flatpak-bisect and flatpak-coredumpctl to devel subpackage,
  allow to remove python3 dependency on main package.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec 15 10:36:42 UTC 2020 - Martin Liška <mliska@suse.cz>

- Enable LTO (boo#1133124) as gobject-introspection works fine with LTO.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov 23 17:30:01 UTC 2020 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 1.8.3:
  + Fixed progress reporting for OCI and extra-data.
  + The in-memory summary cache is more efficient.
  + Fixed authentication getting stuck in a loop in some cases.
  + Fixed authentication error reporting.
  + We now extract OCI info for runtimes as well as apps.
  + Fixed crash if anonymous authentication fails and -y is
    specified.
  + flatpak info now only looks at the specified installation if
    one is specified.
  + Better error reporting for server HTTP errors during download.
  + Uninstall now removes applications before the runtime it
    depends on.
  + Fixed test-suite to pass with the latest OSTree version.
  + Fixed dbus environment variables in flatpak enter.
  + Avoid updating metadata from the remote when uninstalling.
  + Fixed error message handling in various places.
  + FlatpakTransaction now verifies all passed in refs to avoid.
  + potential issues with invalid names.
  + Updated translations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Aug 22 13:10:16 UTC 2020 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.8.2:
  + Added validation of collection id settings for remotes.
  + Fix seccomp filters on s390.

Wed Aug 19 07:44:25 UTC 2020 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Fix invalid usage of %{_libexecdir} to reference systemd
  directories.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul 10 08:55:59 UTC 2020 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Update to version 1.8.1:
  * Avoid calling authenticator in update if ref didn't change
  * Don't fail transaction if ref is already installed (after
    transaction start)
  * Fix flatpak run handling of userns in the --device=all case
  * Fix handling of extensions from different remotes
  * Fix flatpak run --no-session-bus
  * Updated translations

- Update to version 1.8.0:
  * FlatpakTransaction has a new signal "install-authenticator"
    which clients can handle to install authenticators needed for
    the transaction. This is done in the CLI commands.
  * We now always expose the host timezone data, allowing us the
    expose the host /etc/localtime in a way that works better,
    fixing several apps that had timezone issues.
  * Fix flatpak enter which didn't work in some cases.
  * We now ship a systemd unit (not installed by default) to
    automatically detect plugged in usb sticks with sideload repos.
  * By default we no longer install the gdm env.d file, as the
    systemd generators work better.
  * create-usb now exports partial commits by default
  * Fix handling of docker media types in oci remotes
  * Fix subjects in remote-info --log output

- Remove source file used to generate a flatpak user on the system
  since it's now included by upstream:
  * system-user-flatpak.conf

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul  7 10:26:44 UTC 2020 - Callum Farmer <callumjfarmer13@gmail.com>

- Fixes for %_libexecdir changing to /usr/libexec

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun 25 21:10:14 UTC 2020 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.6.4:
  + This release backports some of the OCI authenticator fixes from
    the 1.7 series, and should now be able to host flatpak images
    on e.g. docker hub.
  + Other changes:
    - Fix a use-after free in libflatpak.
    - Don't list p2p downgrades in list of available updates.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun 16 02:21:39 UTC 2020 - Yifan Jiang <yfjiang@suse.com>

- Create a skeleton flatpak repo using "flatpak remotes" instead
  of a manually created directory (bsc#1172316, bsc#1169619,
  bsc#1170416).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May 18 08:53:10 UTC 2020 - Yifan Jiang <yfjiang@suse.com>

- When SLE uses GNOME desktop environment, GNOME Software is
  automatically started to provide key update features. During the
  startup, it setups flatpak repository so that related features
  can function properly. In a system environment of no flatpak
  repository has ever been setup before, this triggers
  "org.freedesktop.Flatpak.modify-repo" polkit action.

  Therefore in systems which use a restrictive security policy
  (eg. SLES) for the aforementioned policy action, a polkit
  authentication dialog will pop up without any user interaction
  for the first time login. This is not user friendly.

  This submission creates /var/lib/flatpak/repo at package
  installation to avoid such a confusing authentication pop-up, at
  nearly 0 cost of security compromise (bsc#1169619, bsc#1170416).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr  6 14:31:20 UTC 2020 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Require bubblewrap 0.4.1

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr  6 09:32:31 UTC 2020 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Update to version 1.6.3:
  + The main change in this version is a fix for a regression in
    the progress calculation for applications using extra-data.
    Additionally the bundled version of bubblewrap is updated to
    0.4.1 which fixes a security issue in some cases. See
    GHSA-j2qp-rvxj-43vj for details.
  + Don't break if users primary gid is not in the nsswitch
    database
  + Fix crash in flatpak repair if no remotes are configured
  + Some updates to the oci authenticator
  + Retry downloads of extra data
  + Updated translations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Feb 16 17:22:44 UTC 2020 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Drop obsolete _servicedata file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb 13 15:57:51 UTC 2020 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Update to version 1.6.2:
  + Due to a combination of some behaviour in flatpak and recent
    versions of ostree we at some point lost the use of deltas for
    the initial install case, instead always falling back to a full
    ostree operation which is a lot less efficient for pulls with
    many small files like a runtime. This caused some very slow
    installs from e.g. flathub, so it's recommended to update to
    this version to get better install performance.
  + We now correctly handle TMPDIR env var overrides when bwrap is
    setuid
  + Disallow running "flatpak run" under sudo (as it doesn't work
    and causes issues)
  + Fix build with older versions of glib
  + Minor documentation updates
  + Updated translations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 30 16:56:01 UTC 2020 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Update to version 1.6.1:
  + This is a (mild) security update. Flatpak 1.6.0 added the
    ability for an application to request it to be updated, as long
    as the new version doesn't require new permissions.
    Unfortunately in some special cases, if an app had access to
    the home directory, but not the rest of the filesystem it would
    still allow a self-update where the new version could access
    some files outside the home directory.
  + New permission --device=shm giving access to host /dev/shm, as
    needed for jack.
  + Generated correct download size in build-commit-from
  + sub-sandbox now allows the child to share the gpu of the caller
    has full device access
  + Fix crash with disabled remotes
  + Fix builds with older versions of glib
  + Updated translations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jan 25 14:07:31 UTC 2020 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- No longer recommend -lang: supplements are in use

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan 14 11:23:06 UTC 2020 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Update dependencies required by flatpak 1.6.0 .
- Require xdg-dbus-proxy instead of building the (outdated)
  builtin version.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec 30 10:00:24 UTC 2019 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Change %_prefix/lib to %_libexecdir: Makefile installs the file
  explicitly into libexecdir. Let's be ready in case this path is
  going to change.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Dec 27 10:23:14 UTC 2019 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Co-own  /usr/lib/systemd/user-environment-generators. We don't
  want to forcibly pull in systemd into the buildroot just to own
  this directory.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Dec 20 22:44:39 UTC 2019 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.6.0:
  + This is the first stable release in the 1.6 series, main
    changes since 1.4 is the support for protected content and
    improvements in the self-sandboxing support.
  + There is one change in the support for OCI remotes, we now only
    support the use of labels, not annotations, as labels work with
    more registries. This means pre-existing OCI flatpak registries
    (like fedora) may need some changes.
  + New permissions --socket=cups for direct cups access.
  + Fix some leaks.
  + Fix reporting of progress with latest version of ostree.
  + New no-interaction flag for authenticators.
  + Support for auto-installing authenticators from a flatpak
    remote.
  + Warn less about unset XDG_DATA_DIRS.
  + Don't poll for updates in the portal when on a metered
    connection.
- Modernize spec with current macros.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov 25 16:59:29 UTC 2019 - Frederic Crozat <fcrozat@suse.com>

- Package empty /etc/flatpak/remotes.d.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov 20 12:53:08 UTC 2019 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Add pkgconfig(libsystemd) BuildRequires (boo#1157126).
- Drop systemd_requires: strictly speaking, we do not require
  systemd.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 21 19:10:42 UTC 2019 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.4.3:
  + Fix crash in revokefs.
  + Handle 'versions' extension key (in addition to 'version') when
    checking for local extensions, which was causing us to
    uninstall some actually used extensions with uninstall
    --unused.
  + The 'required-flatpak' metadata key now supports listing
    multiple versions to support backported features.
  + Fix crash with older versions of polkit.
  + Fix installation of bundles.
  + Fix crash on deploy error.
  + Support building bundles of apps installed from a remote.
  + OCI: Fix handling of locally cached icons.
  + Fix crash when listing unconfigured remotes.
  + Ignore differences in trailing slashes for repo uris.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul  8 12:53:30 UTC 2019 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Add system-user-flatpak.conf: generate a flatpak user for the
  system helper (boo#1137537).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul  3 08:27:20 UTC 2019 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Update to version 1.4.2:
  * Support extra_data in extensions.
  * Handle double slashes ("//") in XDG_DATA_DIRS.
  * Fix detection of local related refs.
- jsc#SLE-7171

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun 14 09:33:16 UTC 2019 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Add a _dbusconfigdir variable in the spec file so we install the
  flatpak-system-helper config file in a location actually read by
  dbus, which didn't support having config files in /usr/share
  until 1.9.18 (first introduced in SLE15).
- Remove the systemd environment generator if building with
  systemd < 233 which doesn't support environment generators.
- Rename the libflapak-doc.xml file which has a typo in the name
  upstream.
- BuildRequire libgpgme-devel, not libqgpgme-devel which is not
  really needed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun 13 23:13:29 UTC 2019 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.4.1:
  + There was an accidental ABI break in libflatpak in 1.4.0
    compared to the 1.2.x ABI which caused crashes in apps like
    gnome-software.
  + This has been fixed in this release so it is now ABI compatible
    with 1.2.x, but NOT compatible with 1.4.0. It is recommended
    that all distributions that shipped 1.4.0 update to 1.4.1 and
    rebuild all dependencies of libflatpak.
  + Make ABI compatible with 1.2.x.
  + Fix some potential crashes.
  + Fix some corner case where it was impossible to remove a
    remote.
  + Restore support for file: uris in the RuntimeRepo key in
    flatpakref files.
  + Updated translations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 29 07:14:13 UTC 2019 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.4.0:
  + This is the new stable series, ending the 1.3.x series. The
    major changes since the 1.2.x is the improved I/O use for
    system-installed applications, and the new format for
    pre-configured remotes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May 13 07:45:05 UTC 2019 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Replace systemd-gtk BuildRequires with pkgconfig(systemd): make
  the build cheaper by not having to wait for the 'real' systemd
  package to have built, but allow to use systemd-mini. The change
  in the stack causing this was polkit dropping its hard dep on
  systemd.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat May 11 20:53:45 UTC 2019 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Add systemd-gtk BuildRequires: Needed now after changes elsewhere
  in the stack.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr 24 09:45:40 UTC 2019 - Martin Liška <mliska@suse.cz>

- Disable LTO (boo#1133124).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar 28 13:05:50 UTC 2019 - Andrei Dziahel <develop7@develop7.info>

- Update to verson 1.2.4 (CVE-2019-10063):
  + It has been discovered that the previous fix for CVE-2017-5226,
    which uses seccomp to prevent sandboxed apps from using the
    (dangerous) TIOCSTI ioctl was only incomplete on 64bit arches.
    This is now fixed (boo#1130637, gh#flatpak/flatpak#2782).
  + seccomp: Only compare the low 32bit of the TIOCSTI ioctl args.
  + Support multiple nvidia cards on the machine
  + Fix support for systems where XDG_RUNTIME_DIR is /var/run which
    is a symlink like gentoo.
  + Fix potential crash when updating apps.
  + flatpak list --arch now works correctly again.
  + Updated translations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb 13 08:06:06 UTC 2019 - alarrosa@suse.com

- Update to version 1.2.3:
  + Don't expose /proc in apply_extra script sandbox. The CVE-2019-5736
    runc vulnerability is about using /proc/self/exe to modify the host
    side binary from the sandbox. This mostly does not affect flatpak
    since the flatpak sandbox is not run with root permissions.
    However, there is one case (running the apply_extra script for
    system installs) where this happens, so this release contains a fix
    for that.
- Update to version 1.2.2:
  + Reverted green checkbox as they caused table alignment issues
  + Fix a division by zero if the terminal reports a zero terminal
    width (which happens in the flathub build environment).
- Update to version 1.2.1:
  + Ensure flatpak builds with older versions of glib and
    appstream-glib.
  + build-commit-from: Fix the new --extra-id option.
  + build-export: Allow disabling the sandboxing of the icon validator
    and do so during the tests.
  + profile: Don't break if debug logging is enabled.
  + Better handling of the appdata release attribute.
  + Don't install polkit agent when not needed, avoiding some
    unnecessary log lines in some cases.
  + Fix the output of the sandboxed icon validator not being visible.
  + builld-init: Allow specifying a full ref for the sdk, which is
    used to select the branch name when checking sdk extensions.
  + Make the ok checks in the output green

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 28 20:58:56 UTC 2019 - bjorn.lie@gmail.com

- Update to version 1.2.0:
  + Ensure DeployCollectionID works in flatpakrepo files in all
    cases.
  + Don't error out with empty installations in uninstall.
  + Add helper that validates icon files during export.
  + Don't allow root to modify the (non-root) per-user flatpak
    installation, as this risks causing problems later.
  + Remove some incorrect warnings from flatpak repair.
  + Allow multiple name segments after prefix when exporting files.
  + Allow specification of ellipsization in --colums options.
  + Handle dates as well as timestamps in appdata
  + Fixed a bug where flatpak remote-delete removed too many refs.
  + Now we use raw terminal mode during a transaction to a avoid
    problems with input during the operation causing problems with
    escape sequences.
  + Generate a fontconfig directory remapping snippet as will be
    needed for newer versions of fontconfig.
  + Support --extra-collection-id in build-commit-from to bind the
    commit to multiple collection ids. This is work in progress in
    ostree.
- Add pkgconfig(dconf) BuildRequires: New dependency.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec 13 12:54:42 UTC 2018 - alarrosa@suse.com

- Update to version 1.0.6:
  + This release fixes an issue that lets system-wide installed
    applications create setuid root files inside their app dir
    (somewhere in /var/lib/flatpak/app). Setuid support is disabled
    inside flatpaks, so such files are only a risk if the user runs
    them manually outside flatpak. Installing a flatpak system-wide
    needs root access, so this isn't a privilege elevation for
    non-root users.
  + The permissions of the files created by the apply_extra script
    is canonicalized and the script itself is run without any
    capabilities.
  + Better matching of existing remotes when the local and remote
    configuration differs wrt collection ids.
  + New flatpakrepo DeployCollectionID replaces CollectionID, doing
    the same thing. It is recommended to use this instead because
    older versions of flatpak has bugs in the support of collection
    ids, and this key will only be respected in versions where it
    works.
  + The X11 socket is now mounted read-only.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec 13 12:29:18 UTC 2018 - alarrosa@suse.com

- Mark flatpak.sh as %config and move the systemhelper dbus config
  file under /usr
- Remove the flatpak-rpmlintrc file that is no longer needed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov 16 10:09:01 UTC 2018 - matthias.gerstner@suse.com

- Make polkit_rules_usability.patch effective by adding a 60- prefix
  to the rules file. This will cause it to be executed before the
  polkit-default-privs are executed (bsc#984817).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov 13 08:55:03 UTC 2018 - alarrosa@suse.com

- Update to version 1.0.5:
  + Make the /etc -> /usr/etc bind-mounts read-only.
  + Make various app-specific configuration files read-only.
  + flatpak is more picky about remote names to avoid problems with
    storing weird names in the ostree config.
  + A segfault in libflatpak handling of bundles was fixed.
  + Updated translations
  + Fixed a regression in flatpak run that caused problems running
    user-installed apps when the system installation was broken.
  + Implicity grant MPRIS2 permissions
- Changes from version 1.0.4:
  + Flatpak 0.99.1 removed the inheritance of permissions from the
    runtime due to concerns with dynamic app permissions. Due to
    popular requests, this version re-introduces such inheritance,
    but does it instead at build time. This solved the issues with
    dynamic permissions while still allowing runtimes to have
    default permissions. Apps can disable this by passing
    --no-inherit-permissions to build-finish.
  + The sandbox now always includes a /etc/timezone file, following
    the (old) debian standard for this. This is needed, because the
    more modern way of exposing the timezone name by having
    /etc/localtime be a symlink into /usr/share/zoneinfo doesn't
    work when exposing the host timezone.
  + All apps now have automatic permissions to own their own app id
    as a subname of org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.
  + We now properly re-load remote state in FlatpakTransaction if
    the metadata was updated for the remote.
  + The signature of the FlatpakTransaction::operation-done signal
    was wrong in the header and has now been corrected to the
    signature that is actually emitted.
  + A crash was fixed when reading invalid .flatpakref files.
  + A crash during updates when a local ref was unexpectedly
    missing was fixed.
  + An error case on uninstalling was incorrectly returning success
    even thought there was an error.
  + flatpak_installation_modify_remote did not correctly save the
    nodeps state.
  + flatpak_installation_load_app_overrides() was improperly
    returning freed memory.
  + The tarball now ships with an icon (flatpak.png).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct 19 12:05:14 UTC 2018 - alarrosa@suse.com

- Add rpmlintrc to ignore files being installed under /etc not
  marked as %config (since they're not).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct 16 10:14:52 UTC 2018 - alarrosa@suse.com

- Don't run "flatpak remote-list --system" on %post anymore since
  it's not needed nowadays. Also let /var/lib/flatpak be created on
  demand since writing to /var should be avoided for transactional
  updates (boo#1111385, fate#325524).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct 11 16:30:24 UTC 2018 - alarrosa@suse.com

- Update to version 1.0.3:
  + run: You can now use --system to run an app that otherwise
    would run the user version.
  + New permission --allow=canbus that filters out access to AF_CAN
    sockets.
  + lib: New install flags FLATPAK_INSTALL_FLAGS_NO_TRIGGERS and
    new function flatpak_installation_run_triggers()
  + lib: Better error reporting, including some new error values
    that replace the generic FAILED.
  + uninstall --unused: Improve handling of which .Locale
    extensions are used
  + run: Make flatpak run on systems where $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR
    contains a symlink beneath /var (commonly /var/run -> /run).
  + Don't export any desktop/dbus/mimetype files in subdirectories.
  + build-init: We now record the base ref (if used) in the
    metadata. Nothing uses this atm, but it can be used by tools.
  + We now respect the upstream ostree.deploy-collection-id instead
    of the flatpak-specific xa.collection-id metadata key to decide
    whether to switch to collection ids for a remote. This is
    useful, because if you use the new one, only new clients (that
    support it better) will use it.
  + create-usb: Fix assertion failure in some error cases
  + create-usb: Always create archive-z2 repos
  + create-usb: Don't create unnecessary summary in repo
  + permissions: Avoid errors if there is no permissions table
  + repo: Fix flatpak repo sometimes using the wrong
    ostree-metadata ref.
  + Avoid fsync when updating $installation/.changed.
  + Add the missing appstream2 ref to the xa.cache metadata
  + The test-suite got some modifications to make it easier to
    maintain.
  + Documentation updates
  + Translation updates
- Changges from version 1.0.2:
  + The dbus proxy is now available in a separate git module,
    xdg-dbus-portal, which is imported into flatpak as a submodule.
    It is possible to build flatpak against the system
    xdg-dbus-portal instead, but this is not currently very useful
    as no other applications yet depend on xdg-dbus-portal.
  + Build regressions with older versions of glib have been fixed.
  + Flatpak ps now also tracks the pid the main process inside the
    sandbox.
  + Added flatpak override --reset to reset overrides for an app.
  + Added flatpak override --show to show overrides for an app.
  + flatpak install now automatically pick user or system based on
    the remote name given (unless the remote exists in both).
  + flatpak uninstall --unused now does not remove SDKs if some
    installed app refers to them.
  + Fixed bug where flatpak uninstall --unused prompted for
    uninstall twice.
  + Set IO class on the system helper to "idle", which should
    cause background updates to affect the system less.
  + Fixed regression in flatpak uninstall --no-related.
  + Better handling of empty collection ids in flatpak bundles.
  + Cleaned up some error messages.
  + Various documentation fixes and cleanups.
  + Updated translations.
- Changes from version 1.0.1:
  + This fixes various build and test failures that were detected
    when packaging 1.0, as well as translations and doc udpates.
    It also has some minor features, including a new subcommand
    "flatpak ps" to list the running flatpak instances for your
    user.
  + Print application tags in the prompt when installing/updating.
  + Make sure we don't accidentally leak the host /proc into
    the sandbox.
  + Translation updates.
  + Added a "flatpak ps" command that lists running flatpak
    instances.
  + Improve error reporting when exporting documents.
  + Improve detection of dynamic p2p remotes.
  + Build fixes for older versions of glib.
  + Fix threading issue in the OCI support that was causing the
    installed tests to sometimes fail.
  + Fix OCI AppStream support on 32bit architectures.
  + Fix utf8 issue in the dbus API description.
  + Some install fixes to make installed tests work
  + Make the tests work with python3 (as well as python2)
  + Improve introspection annotations in libflatpak
  + Improve libflatpak API docs

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 27 09:00:17 UTC 2018 - opensuse-packaging@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.0.0:
  + Flatpak 1.0 marks a significant improvement in performance and
    reliability, and includes a big collection of bug fixes. 1.0
    also includes a collection of new features.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 13 21:31:09 UTC 2018 - opensuse-packaging@opensuse.org

- Update to version 0.99.3:
  + Fixed case where system install would sometimes fail due to the
    system-helper idle exiting.
  + Support installing flatpakref files in FlatpakTransaction,
    including a new signal add-new-remote for when remotes might be
    added.
  + Added some new FlatpakError codes.
  + We now support .flatpakrepo files with no gpg signatures.
  + Fix crash in system-helper when updating appstream.
  + New command create-usb which can be used to prepare an repo for
    offline updates.
  + Fix some non-handled cases of the CLI not working when
    /var/lib/flatpak doesn't exist.
  + Fix crash when running with a gid that is not in /etc/groups.
  + Add new permission-* commands to interact with the permissions
    store from the portals.
  + Include appdata in OCI bundle.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul 23 15:13:44 UTC 2018 - matthias.gerstner@suse.com

- polkit_rules_usability.patch: Improve usability by allowing
  members of the group 'wheel' to bypass polkit authentication
  checks when locally logged in (bnc#984817). This adds a few
  polkit actions to the rules that are not covered by upstream,
  because they are set to 'yes' for active users by default. On
  SUSE we require 'auth_admin' for regular users, however.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun 28 02:54:24 UTC 2018 - luc14n0@linuxmail.org

- Update to version 0.99.2:
  + Updated translations.
- Changes from version 0.99.1:
  + This is the first pre-release before flatpak 1.0. This is
    considered feature-complete and no features or major changes
    before 1.0 are expected, only bugfixes.
  + Flatpak install/update/uninstall now lists all the operations
    that it will do and asks for confirmation before starting.
  + In the above confirmation the permissions (new permissions for
    updates) are shown for all applications.
  + P2P updates are more efficient.
  + system-wide installation uses less fsync calls so installation
    should be faster.
  + New ssh agent permissions allows granting an app ssh access.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun 15 03:24:22 UTC 2018 - luc14n0@linuxmail.org

- Update to version 0.11.8.3:
  + Fix a 25 second timeout on startup if using p11-kit < 0.23.10.
  + Minor change in dbus proxy default filter, now broadcasts are
    not accepted from portals.
- Changes from version 0.11.8.2:
  + Fix crash when building some apps.
  + Allow multiple appstream components per app.
  + Fix handling of gl drivers in uninstall --unused.
  + Don't prompt if nothing changed in uninstall --unused.
  + Updated translations.
- Changes from version 0.11.8.1:
  + Fixed regression running apps with --own=* permissions.
- Changes from version  0.11.8:
  + Flatpak uninstall now accepts --all to remove everything and
    --unused to remove unused runtimes.
  + New command "flatpak repair" allows checking and repairing a
    flatpak  installation.
  + New permission --allow=bluetooth allows use of AF_BLUETOOTH
    sockets.
  + If p11-kit-server is installed on the host, this is now used to
    forward the host certificate trust store to the sandboxed app.
  + Flatpak uninstall now does not allow you to remove a runtime if
    some installed app requires it.
  + Now tab-completion for zsh is offered.
  + New installations of flatpak now defaults to bare-user-only
    repos, which means that it works with filesystems that don't
    support xattrs.
  + New flatpak info options: --show-location, --show-runtime,
    --show-sdk.
  + New flatpak remote-info options: --show-runtime, --show-sdk
  + p2p operations now work when offline.
  + Work around hanging on app startup on blocking autofs mounts.
  + Various optimizations make installation and updates faster.
  + Multiple extension versions matches when auto-downloading
    extensions are respected now.
  + Commands like "flatpak info/list/remotes/seach" now work
    properly if /var/lib/flatpak doesn't exist.
- Add subpackage flatpak-zsh-completion to follow upstream zsh
  tab-completion addition.

    the session bus.
  * libflatpak got new methods for listing remotes by type.
  * libflatpak now has support in FlatpakRemoteRef for getting remote metadata

- Update to version 0.10.2.1:
  + Fixed crash when installing some flatpak bundle files
  + Fix installation of telegram
  + Fixed some warnings reported by coverity
  + Some leaks fixed
  + Fixed typo in error message

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec 20 10:57:05 UTC 2017 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 0.10.2:
  + flatpak update now updates from both system and user
    installations by default.
  + flatpak update is less noisy when updating appstream info.
  + All the remote-* commands now by default automatically decide
    to use --user or --system based on the given remote name.
  + flatpak remote-ls with no remote lists the content of all
    remotes.
  + Fixed regression that made xdg-user-dirs and theme selection
    for kde apps break.
  + flatpak override with no argument now overrides globally, i.e.
    for all apps.
  + flatpak override now supports --nofilesystem properly. For
    example flatpak override --nofilesystem=~/.ssh hides the ssh
    dir for all apps, even those who have homedir access.
  + flatpak install now takes a --reinstall argument which
    uninstalls a previously installed version if necessary. This is
    very useful when you want to install a new version from a
    different source.
  + flatpak install now allows you to pass an absolute pathname as
    remote name, which will create a temporary remote and install
    from that. The remote will be removed when the app is
    uninstalled. This is very useful during development and
    testing.
  + Flatpak now creates CLI wrappers for all installed apps, so if
    you add /var/lib/flatpak/exports/bin or
    ~/.local/share/flatpak/exports/bin to your PATH you can easily
    start flatpak apps by their application id.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov 27 08:40:56 UTC 2017 - aplazas@suse.com

- Update to version 0.10.1:
  + New command "flatpak remote-info" shows information about
    applications in a remote. In particular the --log operation
    shows the history and can be used in combination with flatpak
    update --commit=XYZ to roll back to a previous version.
  + New command "flatpak search" which allows you to search the
    appstream data from the commandline.
  + flatpak update now updates appstream data for all configured
    remotes, which is important for search to work.
  + Allow automatic installation of gtk themes matching the active
    theme.
  + Handle the case when /etc/resolv.conf is a symlink.
  + /usr an /etc are now expose in /run/host in the app if the app
    has full filesystem access.
  + flatpak remote-add now works as a user when /var/lib/flatpak is
    empty, allowing flatpak to work on stateless systems.
  + Add support for flatpak build --log-session/system-bus, similar
    to what flatpak run already does.
  + flatpak build --readonly runs with the target directory
    (normally /app) mounted read-only.
  + Fall back to LD_LIBRARY_PATH if a runtime doesn't have
    /usr/bin/ldconfig.
  + Updated the support for OCI remotes. This is work in progress
    and still disabled by default though.
  + Updated translations.
- Add pkgconfig(appstream-glib) BuildRequires: New dependency.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct 26 11:08:27 UTC 2017 - aplazas@suse.com

  + New libflatpak API: flatpak_dir_cleanup_undeployed_refs,
    flatpak_installation_prune_local_repo,
    flatpak_installation_remove_local_ref_sync,
    flatpak_installation_cleanup_local_refs_sync.
  + build: FLATPAK_ID and FLATPAK_ARCH are now set in the
    environment when building.
  + update: Don't fail the entire update if some remote fails to
    update its metadata.
  + run: /.flatpak-info now lists exact commits and extensions in
    use.
  + run: We now use a per-app ld.so.cache file whenn running. This
    should speed things up, and allows ldconfig to report the
    correct results.
  + The verbose mode was changed into two levels, use -vv to show
    the more detailed info, which currently only contains the full
    bubblewrap argument lists.
  + run: Some common problematic host environment variables are now
    unset in the sandbox (PYTHONPATH, PERLLIB, PERL5LIB and
    XCURSOR_PATH).
  + run: Fixed failure when a higher prio extensions depended on a
    lower prio one.
  + run: The extension ld path order is now: app extensions, app,
    runtime extension, runtime. This was previously incorrect in
    that the app could override app extensions.
  + Extensions are now not downloaded if a matching unmaintained
    extension is already installed.
  + Preemptive changes to handle new bubblewrap change which
    doesn't user /newroot.
  + document portal: Disable debug spew that was accidentally
    enabled.
  + build-finish: New --extension-priority option.
  + run: Fix regression in --persist in 0.9.98.
  + run: Use sealed memfds (instead of just temporary files) when
    passing data to bubblewrap.
  + Updated translations.
- Changes from version 0.9.98.2:
  + Fix permission denied when using the system-helper.
- Changes from version 0.9.98.1:
  + run: Fix homedir access if the app has --filesystem=host
    access.
  + build-update: Fix appstream update in case one arch didn't
    change.
  + Updated translations.
- Changes from version 0.9.98:
  + libflatpak now correctly finds metadata for subset
    installations (like locale data).
  + flatpak build now supports --appdir which exposes the per-app
    directory in the user homedir. This is useful when testing
    builds.
  + The host fontconfig caches are exposed to the sandbox, next to
    the fonts in /run/host. This will (pending fontconfig work)
    allow sharing host fontconfig caches, allowing much faster
    initial startup for flatpak apps.
  + flatpak install now supports --no-pull.
  + Added new extension property "locale-subset", which makes the
    extension point act like a locale extension (i.e. only install
    the subset configured by the locale).
  + flatpak remote-add --oci is disabled for now, as this is not up
    to date with the latest OCI work, and we don't want to break
    existing deployments if this has to change when this lands.
  + Parallel installation/updates are now safe because we take a
    filesystem lock whenever we prune the local ostree repo.
  + Flatpak run now works when important paths like $HOME, etc, are
    symlinks.
  + The ostree min-free-space property is is set to zero by default
    for the flatpak repos. This was causing a lot of problems for
    people, but the feature is still there if you manually enable
    it.
  + Updated translations.
  + Require ostree 2017.12.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 14 12:44:06 UTC 2017 - fezhang@suse.com

- Drop the SLE12 / Leap42 conditional definition for _userunitdir.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 14 08:23:56 UTC 2017 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 0.9.12:
  + Fixed a regression in extra-data installation.
  + Don't expose the a11y bus in flatpak build.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 13 16:11:17 UTC 2017 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 0.9.11:
  + You can now show all outstanding updates with: flatpak
    remote-ls --updates.
  + The dbus filter "org.name.*" now means all subnames of
    org.name, not just the first level. This matches how dbus
    arg0namespace works, and how the comming dbus container support
    will work.
  + Fixed segfault on update.
  + Better commandline tab completion.
  + Flatpak now exposes host icons readonly as
    /run/host/share/icons to the sandbox.
  + Updated translations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 13 12:01:40 UTC 2017 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 0.9.10:
  + Fix regression in dbus proxy that causes some apps to not work
    in 0.9.9.
- Changes from version 0.9.9:
  + flatpak-builder was split out into its own module:
    https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak-builder
  + When downloading to a temporary directory for later install to
    the system repo we now write to /var/tmp instead of $HOME. This
    is more likely to be the same filesystem as /var/lib/flatpak,
    and thus will not run into issues with e.g. filesystem full.
  + We now get the default language list from AccountService if
    possible.
  + A regression that made --devel crash was fixed.
  + New feature for flatpakrefs, SuggestRemoteName=remotename will
    cause flatpak to ask if you want to create a generic (not app
    specific) remote for the repo url.
  + flatpak build now does not die with the parent by default, you
    have to pass --die-with-parent. This was done because
    die-with-parent uses PR_SET_PDEATHSIG which does not work well
    if the parent is threaded, like e.g. gnome-software is.
  + We now always re-set the personality in the sandboxed process
    in order to avoid inheriting weird settings.
  + We now share a single dbus proxy instance for all proxies for a
    sandbox. dbus-proxy now properly disallows old-style
    eavesdropping.
  + We now support accessibility by starting a customized dbus
    proxy for the a11y bus.
- Drop flatpak-builder sub-package, it is now it's own project.

      all locales for system installs and the users locale for
      per-user installs.
    - build-update-repo: Now always keeps the two latest deltas
      around to avoid race conditions with outstanding downloads at
      the time or running the update.
    - Support loading extra data from local lookaside cache.
  + Flatpak-builder:
    - Set terminal title to the currently building module
    - Added ability to specify http url for sources mirror with
      --extra-sources-url.
    - --install-deps-from=REMOTE installs the dependencies needed
      for the manifest.
    - New option --delete-build-dirs to always delete build
      directories, even on a failed build.
    - New property "add-extension" makes it nicer to create
      extension points.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul 21 00:09:01 UTC 2017 - adrien.plazas@suse.com

- Update to version 0.9.1:
  + The flatpak-builder build cache now uses the rofiles-fuse
    ostree feature.
  + The cflags and cxxflags module properties now work by
    appending, rather that replacing, when there are multiple
    values specified.
  + Do not invalidate build cache when the installed version of the
    SDK changed by default. Use --rebuild-on-sdk-change to force
    rebuild otherwise.
  + The build cache is now per-arch.
  + New buildsystem "cmake-ninja" which works like "cmake", but
    builds using ninja.
  + New buildsystem "simple" which just runs a set of shell
    commands specified in the "build-commands" property.
  + flatpak-builder now has build-runtime and build-extension
    properties that makes it easier to build runtimes and
    extensions.
  + FLATPAK_DEST is set in the build environment to the
    installation destination.
  + flatpak-builder now supports --from-git=URL which pulls the
    json manifest and related files directly from a git repo.
  + modules have a new no-make-install property which skips the
    make install step.
  + Modules and sources have only-arches and skip-arches
    properties, which lets you enable/disable them based on the
    build architecture.
  + build-options has a new property ldflags, which is similar to
    cflags and cxxflags.
  + flatpak build (and thus flatpak-builder --run) now supports
    dbus proxies when needed.
  + All git repos are cloned with fsckObjects=true, which means we
    verify that the repos are valid.
  + New flatpak-builder argument --build-shell=MODULE extracts and
    prepares the sources for a specified module and then starts a
    build sandbox inside it.
  + build-export: Now supports --timestamp=ISO-8601-TIMESTAMP,
    which allows you to create reproducible commits.
  + The OCI support has been updated to the latest version of the
    OCI image specification format.
  + There is a new flatpak-bisect script that can be used to bisect
    flatpak applications, looking for regressions.
  + flatpak list got a revamp. It now shows more information, and
    shows both apps and runtimes by default.
  + flatpak remote-list was renamed flatpak remotes in order to
    minimize confusion with flatpak remote-ls. The old name is
    deprecated but still works.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul 20 20:12:58 UTC 2017 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 0.8.7:
  + This is a minor security update, matching the behaviour on
    master where we avoid ever creating setuid files or
    world-writable directories. However, the fix is more localized
    and does not require a new ostree.
  + After pulling from a remote, always verify that the staged new
    files and directories have safe permissions.
  + Ensure ~/.local/share/flatpak is not readable to other users,
    to avoid anyone ever seeing possibly world-writeable
    directories therein.
  + Fix double-setting a error in case of errors when pulling.
  + Fix timeout in testcase.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul 20 20:12:42 UTC 2017 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 0.8.6:
  + TMPDIR is now unset in the sandbox, if set on the host. Each
    sandbox has a personal /tmp that is used.
  + Flatpak run now works if /tmp is a symlink on the host.
  + /etc/hosts and /etc/hosts.conf from the host are now exposed in
    the sandbox in addition to /etc/resolv.conf.
  + flatpak now stores the app id in the X-Flatpak key when
    exporting a desktop file.
  + Exports are now whitelisted, and the only thing you can
    export are: desktop files, icons, dbus services.
    This is somewhat different from the 0.9.x series, where als
    mime definitions, and gnome-shell search providers are allowed.
  + Fixed minor race condition in portal application
    identification.
  + Support WAYLAND_DISPLAY environment var.
  + dbus-portal: Fix handling of NameHasOwner.
  + run: Allow regular files for --filesystem=xdg-config/path.
  + run: Allow --filesystem=xdg-config/subdir:ro (previously
    it needed to be writable).
  + Support for updating to new gpg keys and url when using
    flatpak remote-modify --update-metadata. This is a manual
    operation in 0.8.x but is automatic in the 0.9.x series.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul 20 20:12:04 UTC 2017 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 0.8.5:
  + Fixed a use-after-free and some leaks in the dbus-proxy. This
    is not currently believed to be exploitable, but the proxy is a
    security boundary, so we still recommend to update.
  + Regular updates now never allow updates to an older version
    than what is currently installed (unless you explicitly specify
    an old commit id). This closes a hole where a MITM attacker can
    force clients to downgrade to an earlier (gpg-signed) version
    of the application.
  + The automatic detection of --from in flatpak install now
    detects flatpakref extensions even in URIs that end in a query
    string such as https://git.gnome.org/browse/gnome-apps-nightly/plain/gedit.flatpakref?h=stable
  + The detection of "unmaintained" system extensions was broken,
    and in some cases these extensions were not found. This now
    always works.
  + Flatpak now builds with latest OSTree. This required some
    fixing for multiple definitions of the g_auto* macros as OSTree
    now exports those.
  + We no longer rely on ostree trivial-httpd for the tests,
    because this is optional in later versions of ostree. Instead
    we use the python SimpleHTTPServer.
  + The minimum glib version has been corrected to 2.44.
  + The minumum automake version has been increased to 1.13.4
    because some older version didn't work.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 10 20:58:11 UTC 2017 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 0.8.4:
  + Fix no-systemd-user warning (it doesn't affect sandboxing
    anymore).
  + run: propagate wildcard xauth entries to app bundle.
  + Don't remove origin remotes if some other ref uses it.
  + Fix repeated download of locates on update.
  + update: Don't update related refs from different remote.
  + Initialize g_autofree string to NULL, not to crash when early
    returning.
  + document portal: Disable spice_read as it seems broken.
  + Return the container from flatpak_get_system_installations().
  + Don't include newlines in error messages.
  + utils: Fix list_unmtainained_refs.
  + Avoid possible null dereference.
  + utils: Fix flatpak_bundle_load typo.
  + list: Don't check error twice.
  + list-remotes: Handle remotes with no url specified.
  + run: Handle error when enumerating /etc.
  + zero-mtime: Handle error when enumerating directory.
  + Fix error check when loading configuration.
  + Support runtime-less extra-data.
  + flatpak_list_extensions: Break out code into helper.
  + extensions: Support multiple versions.
  + Append flatpak data dirs if XDG_DATA_DIRS is already set
    (gh#flatpak/flatpak#611).
  + appstream: Don't add runtime to flatpak bundle tag for
    runtimes.
  + Split extra-data setup and fetch.
  + Improve progress calculation.
  + profile: Don't add flatpak to XDG_DATA_DIRS if its already
    there.
  + Updated translations.
- Drop flatpak-propagate-xauth-wildcard.patch: fixed upstream.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb 21 16:42:32 UTC 2017 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 0.8.3:
  + In addition to the regular list of bugfixes this stable release
    include backports of the updated OpenGL support from master.
    This, in combination with the work in the runtime allows
    flatpak to work out of the box with out-of-tree OpenGL drivers,
    including the nvidia driver.
  + Additionally, due to some complicated issues wrt ptrace and
    user namespaces this version disables the use of user
    namespaces if bubblewrap is setuid, as it cause problems for
    the way flatpak portals identifies applications.
  + Better handling of errors for extra-data.
  + Handle extra-data properly for runtimes (as well as apps).
  + Respect required version for runtimes (as well as apps).
  + flatpak list: Don't break if some local ref is not deployed.
  + builder:
    - Look for appstream data in /app/share/metadata also.
    - Fix buildsystem=cmake builds.
  + Add progress reporting to extra-data download.
  + Fix uid/gid for directories in document portal.
  + Updated translations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb 15 15:28:07 UTC 2017 - adrien.plazas@suse.com

- Add flatpak-propagate-xauth-wildcard.patch which ensures
  applications have the right to communicate with the X server.
  (gh#flatpak/flatpak#569).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb 10 16:45:25 UTC 2017 - kamikazow@opensuse.org

- Update to version 0.8.2:
  + This is a bugfix and security update:
    - Some of the bind-mounts that flatpak sets up were not
      read-only as they should have. This includes: extensions,
      system fonts, resolv.conf, localtime and machine-id. Many of
      these are typically only writable by root, but some, like the
      user-specific fonts and user-installed extensions could be
      modified from the sandbox.
  + Other fixes:
    - There are new configure options for where to install dbus
      configuration.
    - Broken symlinks in the root directory no longer break flatpak
      run.
    - flatpak run with HOME in /var now works.
    - dri access now also handles mali devices.
    - install handles --arch when installing flatpakrefs.
    - system-helper activation fixed on systemd-less setups.
    - dbus-proxy now works without /run.
    - During installation, failing to update a dependency is now
      not fatal.
    - /etc is now fully writable when building runtimes.
    - --filesystem=xdg-config/foo now sets up the bind-mount from
      the host dir even when not using :create.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb 10 16:45:02 UTC 2017 - kamikazow@opensuse.org

- Update to version 0.8.1:
  + This is a bugfix and security update (CVE-2017-5226):
    - Flatpak now uses seccomp to disallow the TIOCSTI ioctl in the
      sandbox, which works around the possibility to inject text on
      the controlling tty (CVE-2017-5226).
    - This was previously fixed in bubblewrap in 0.1.6, but that
      change has now been reverted as it introduced other problems
      for flatpak.
  + Update bundled bubblewrap to 0.1.7.
  + Fix writing new file with O_EXCL in the document portal.
  + Allow appstream data that doesn't have .desktop in the
    component id, such as data for runtimes.
  + Drop json-glib dependency from 1.2 to 1.0.
  + Builder: Fail if unable to read included file.
  + OCI: Ensure exported layers are readable by everyone.
  + Fix extra-data download in gnome-software.
  + Fix update-mime-database trigger when installing via the system
    helper.
  + Updating an app by installing a newer bundle now works again.
  + Make /var/tmp not be on a tmpfs (it is now in
    ~/.var/app/$appid/cache/tmp).
  + Updated documentation.
  + Updated translations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec 22 14:43:23 UTC 2016 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 0.8.0:
  + This is the first release in a new series of stable releases
    called 0.8.x. New features will be added to 0.9.x, and only
    bugfixes will be backported to 0.8.x. The featureset of this
    release is a good base to target if you're creating flatpaks
    that should be widely usable.
  + This release technically requires only OSTree 2016.14, and it
    build fine with this, but we recommend using OSTree 2016.15,
    because of the change in how it verifies the checksums of
    commits in delta files.
  + Flatpakrepo files now support a RuntimeRepo= key which points
    to a flatpakrepo file. This means the user don't have to
    manually configure a remote for the runtime, just reply to the
    prompt to automatically do this when installing the app.
  + We now support dependencies when installing bundles. This
    includes required runtimes, related refs, and the equivalent of
    RuntimeRepo.
  + The support for OCI in flatpak has been updated to the latest
    OCI spec version, and support has been added to directly
    install flatpak applications from an OCI image.
  + In flatpak install, the --from and --bundle options are now
    optional if the argument has the correct suffix (.flatpakref
    and .flatpak).
  + Flatpak install now supports -y to let you avoid interactive
    prompts.
  + build-finish:
    - We now export mime type files with the right name.
    - New --require-version option let you specify a particular
      version of flatpak, and older version of flatpak will not
      install or update to the new version.
  + build-sign: Allow signing all apps by omitting the id.
  + Fix regression in the document portal when adding named files.
  + build-import-bundle now signs the commit if you specify a gpg
    key.
  + Flatpak now reads configuration from
    /etc/flatpak/installations.d which lets you support multiple
    system-level installation paths. These can be accessed with
    new --installation=... arguments to most of the commands.
  + flatpak-builder:
    - Support --jobs=N to limit parallel builds.
    - Patch source got new options property that lets you pass
      arguments to patch.
    - New generic "buildsystem: type" option that replace the (now
      deprecated) "cmake: true" option. This supports "autotools",
      "cmake" and "meson".

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov 29 15:00:20 UTC 2016 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 0.6.14:
  + Update bundled bubblewrap to 0.1.4 which has some nice
    bugfixes.
  + Requires OSTree 2016.14, which allows us to drop some old
    workarounds.
  + When installing an application system-wide, don't consider
    dependencies that are installed for the user only.
  + Flatpak install --from now tries to re-use existing remotes to
    avoid creating unnecessary origin remotes.
  + Using --filesystem=$dir when $dir is a symlink-to-directory now
    works.
  + Using --filesystem=$file to expose unix sockets to the app is
    now allowed.
  + By default all the directories in ~/.var/app (except the app),
    as well as ~/.local/share/flatpak are hidden in the sandbox.
  + New option --filesystem=$dir:create which will create the
    destination if it did not previously exist.
  + --filesystem= now supports for xdg-[config|cache|data]. This
    allows you access to the host versions of these xdg dirs.
    Additionally if you use these with a subdirectory, like:
    --filesystem=xdg-config/subdir then that subdirectory on the
    host will be shared with the per-app instance of the xdg-dir.
  + Builder now correctly handles app-ids that have dashes in them.
    Previously this generated invalid ids for the debuginfo and
    locale extensions.
  + The experimental OCI file format support was changed from
    creating an OCI container to creating an OCI image.
  + Fix regression where "flatpak update --appstream remotename"
    broke.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov  3 17:10:34 UTC 2016 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Require flatpak by flatpak-devel: xdg-desktop-portal expects to
  find org.freedesktop.portal.Documents.xml, which is part of
  flatpak. It's fair to assume everything to be present when
  pulling in the -devel package.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct 26 09:23:14 UTC 2016 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 0.6.13:
  + The command line arguments for install/update/uninstall
    changed.
  + Application runtime depencenies are checked/downloaded.
  + remote-add and install --from now supports uris.
  + flatpak run can now launch a runtime directly.
  + Updated bubblewrap to 0.1.3 (CVE-2016-8659).
  + Support for defining the default branch per remote.
  + remote-add/modify: --update-metadata pulls current title and
    default branch from remote summary file.
  + Applications can now list a set of URIs that will be downloaded
    with the application.
  + flatpak-builder: Support --finish-only and
    --allow-missing-runtimes.
  + flatpak-builder: Support app layering.
  + dbus proxy: The filtering has been tightened up.
  + build-finish: Now exports icons for themes other than hicolor
    too.
  + There is support in the app metadata for generic policies.
  + Support for extensions directories.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 10 17:41:27 UTC 2016 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 0.6.12:
  + Partial revert in application id rules. Application ids can now
    only have dashes in the last element. This allows apps to
    export files such as org.my.App-extra.desktop which was used by
    the libreoffice builds.
  + By default the kernel keyring is not accessable, as it is not
    containable.
  + Some robustness fixes for build-commit-from.
  + Better error messages.
  + flatpak update --appstream now updates for all remotes.
  + Made flatpak enter work, and you can now use any pid in the
    sandbox. However, it requires root permissions.
  + Support for --device=kvm for /dev/kvm access.
  + Support for --allow=multiarch to support non-primary arch
    support. For example running i686 code in an x86_64 app.
  + Add new default-branch setting for the remote configuration.
- Changes from version 0.6.11:
  + Dashes are now allowed in application ids. However, to still
    work with symbolic icon names, they may not end with
    "-symbolic".
  + HostCommand now handles ptys correctly.
  + Various documentation updates.
  + New FLATPAK_CHECK_VERSION macro in libflatpak.
  + HostCommand now returns the real PID rather than a fake one.
  + Fix regression in flatpak update --appstream.
  + Fix regression installing bundles without origin urls.
  + New flatpak-builder option --show-deps lists all the files the
    manifest depends on.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 19 17:51:42 UTC 2016 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 0.6.10:
  + Dropped requirement for systemd --user. The way we detect if an
    process we're talking to is sandboxed, and what application id
    it has doesn't use cgroups anymore, which means that the
    dependency on systemd in the user session is now optional. This
    also means the --no-desktop argument is not needed any more.
    (It is still accepted but does nothing.)
  + Initial support has been added for .flatpakref files. These are
    simple key value files similar to .flatpakrepo files, however
    they specify an application to install in addition to the repo
    information. For example, gedit can be installed by downloading
    https://sdk.gnome.org/gedit.flatpakref and running: flatpak
    install --from gedit.flatpakref There is also library support
    for this so it can be added to graphical installers (such as
    gnome-software).
  + Requires OSTree 2016.10. The change in how OSTree handles
    mtimes in checkouts that was introduced in 2016.7 has been
    reverted, and the required changes in Flatpak has been made.
    This means that flatpak now depends on OSTree 2016.10.
  + Requires Bubblewrap 0.1.2 for builds using the system
    bubblewrap. Builds using the included copy need no changes.
  + The $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/flatpak-info file has added information
    about the running application, and is now also securely
    available for a running application from the host as
    "/proc/$fd/root/.flatpak-info". This is what is used to
    identify remote apps instead of the cgroup info.
  + A new run permission --allow=devel has been added. An
    application with this permission is allowed to use ptrace and
    perf. This was previously only available during "flatpak build"
    and "flatpak run -d". This is useful if you're packaging e.g.
    an IDE.
  + When an application is updated or removed a /app/.updated or
    /app/.removed file is created for running instances. This can
    be used by applications to trigger e.g. a restart for the new
    version.
  + A new dbus request "HostCommand" has been added to
    org.freedesktop.Flatpak. This lets you run any command on the
    host, and is therefore clearly not sandboxed, so access to this
    should be limited. However, it is very useful if you're using
    flatpak mainly as a distribution mechanism, for a non-sandboxed
    application.
  + flatpak-builder now supports running from inside a flatpak, by
    auto-detecting this and using the HostCommand service to run
    recursive flatpaks.
  + Consecutive calls to flatpak build-update-repo has been speed
    up.
  + The document portal now allows sandboxed applications to create
    references to files in /app and /usr (in the app/runtime).
  + The update process now doesn't stop at the first failure.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep 06 15:34:26 UTC 2016 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 0.6.9:
  + Dropped dependency on libgsystem.
  + Allow passing partial refs whenever a CLI command takes an app
    or runtime name.
  + New command build-commit-from creates a new commit based on the
    contents of another commit (optionally from another local
    repo).
  + The sandbox now contains $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/app/$APPID from the
    host (and the directory is created if needed).
  + update: Better output, and faster for the no updates case.
  + build-export: Don't make most validation errors fail, instead
    just print a warning.
  + builder:
    - Support local path references for git sources.
    - Better handling of recursive git submodules.
    - Fixed issues with the .pyc mtime rewriting.
    - Handle symbolic icons for rename-icon.
    - Add --stop-at=$module to do partial builds.
    - Add --sandbox flag to disable the build from escaping from
      the sandbox via build-args.
  + Updated translations.
- Drop pkgconfig(libgsystem) BuildRequires following upstream.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug 16 09:39:38 UTC 2016 - dmacvicar@suse.de

- Update to version 0.6.8:
  + Requires OSTree 2016.7, allowing to enable use of static delta
    for system downloads again.
  + Support --no-desktop which allows you to run a flatpak app
    outside a desktop, with some loss of functionallity
    (for example, there will be no systemd --user scope created for
    the app)..
  + More documentation.
  + Memory leak fixes.
  + Initial support for rpms as flatpak-builder archive sources.
  + Start work on translating the CLI.
  + Install systemd config snippet to set the right XDG_DATA_DIRS
    path.
  + Support --arch in flatpak list.
  + Support access() in the document portal.
  + Validate exported desktop files.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul 19 17:58:13 UTC 2016 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Change /usr/bin/tar Requires to /bin/tar: this has never been
  moved to /usr/bin.

  + New homepage and download url
  + Various fixes

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr 20 11:19:06 UTC 2016 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 0.5.2:
  + The way locale extensions work has changed. Now we build a
    single extension for all locales, but we allow you to specify a
    subset of it during installation and update time using the
    --subpath commandline flag. The main reason for this is that
    the many extensions didn't scale, both in technical terms
    (large ostree summary file size), but also in terms of the UI
    listing hundreds of uninteresting things.
  + We no longer use sizes in the commit objects to get installed
    and download size, instead we store some extra metadata in the
    summary file. This allows us to get much faster access to
    these, as with recent ostree versions we can cache the summary
    file.
  + New command xdg-app build-sign that lets you sign a commit at
    any time.
  + New argument xdg-app build --force-clean that removes
    pre-existing build dirs.
  + xdg-app run now uses the "current" version as the default if
    you specify no branch or arch. It used to default to the
    "master" branch. This will default to the last installed
    version, but can be changed with xdg-app make-current.
  + Added config-opts to the build-options in xdg-app-builder. This
    allows you to extend the configure flags in an arch dependent
    way.
  + Documentation updates.
