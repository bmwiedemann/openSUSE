    <comment>- Add subpackage vim-fzf with the original vim plugin for fzf (there
  is also more extensive third party plugin on
  https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim)
- update to 0.17.4
  * Added --layout option with a new layout called reverse-list.
    --layout=reverse is a synonym for --reverse
    --layout=default is a synonym for --no-reverse
  * Preview window will be updated even when there is no match for
    the query if any of the placeholder expressions (e.g. {q}, {+})
    evaluates to a non-empty string.
  * More keys for binding: shift-{up,down}, alt-{up,down,left,
    right}
  * fzf can now start when /dev/tty is not available by making
    an educated guess.
  * bash/zsh completion improvements
  * install and uninstall scripts support generating files under
    XDG_CONFIG_HOME on --xdg flag.
- remove sed patch for non-excecutable fix (merged upstream)
- initial package

  - 0.18.0
    - Added placeholder expression for zero-based item index: {n}
      and {+n} fzf --preview 'echo {n}: {}'
    - Added color option for the gutter: --color gutter:-1
