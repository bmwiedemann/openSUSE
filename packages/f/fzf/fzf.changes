Sat Jan  4 16:48:23 CET 2020 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Update to 0.20.0:
  - Customizable preview window color (preview-fg and preview-bg
    for --color)

    fzf --preview 'cat {}' \
        --color 'fg:#bbccdd,fg+:#ddeeff,bg:#334455,preview-bg:#223344,border:#778899' \
        --border --height 20 --layout reverse --info inline

    Removed the immediate flicking of the screen on reload action.

    : | fzf --bind 'change:reload:seq {q}' --phony

    Added clear-query and clear-selection actions for --bind

  - It is now possible to split a composite bind action over
    multiple --bind expressions by prefixing the later ones with
    +.

    fzf --bind 'ctrl-a:up+up'

    # Can be now written as
    fzf --bind 'ctrl-a:up' --bind 'ctrl-a:+up'

    # This is useful when you need to write special
    # execute/reload form (i.e. `execute:...`)
    # to avoid parse errors and add more actions to the same key
    fzf --multi --bind 'ctrl-l:select-all+execute:less {+f}' --bind 'ctrl-l:+deselect-all'

  - Fixed parse error of --bind expression where concatenated
    execute/reload action contains + character.

    fzf --multi --bind 'ctrl-l:select-all+execute(less {+f})+deselect-all'

  - Fixed bugs of reload action
    - Not triggered when there's no match even when the command
      doesn't have any placeholder expressions
    - Screen not properly cleared when --header-lines not filled
      on reload

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Nov 17 17:48:38 UTC 2019 - Ismail DÃ¶nmez <idonmez@suse.com>

- Update to 0.19.0
  - Added --phony option which completely disables search functionality.
    Useful when you want to use fzf only as a selector interface. See below.
  - Added "reload" action for dynamically updating the input list without
    restarting fzf. See https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/issues/1750 to
    learn more about it.
  - --multi now takes an optional integer argument which indicates the
    maximum number of items that can be selected
  - If a placeholder expression for --preview and execute action
    (and the new reload action) contains f flag, it is replaced to
    the path of a temporary file that holds the evaluated list.
    This is useful when you multi-select a large number of items
    and the length of the evaluated string may exceed ARG_MAX.
  - deselect-all no longer deselects unmatched items. It is now
    consistent with select-all and toggle-all in that it only affects
    matched items.
  - Due to the limitation of bash, fuzzy completion is enabled by
    default for a fixed set of commands. A helper function for easily
    setting up fuzzy completion for any command is now provided.
  - Info line style can be changed by --info=STYLE
  - Preview window border can be disabled by adding noborder to --preview-window.
  - When you transform the input with --with-nth, the trailing white spaces are removed.
  - ctrl-\, ctrl-], ctrl-^, and ctrl-/ can now be used with --bind
  - See https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/milestone/15?closed=1 for more details

Thu Apr 18 21:21:59 CEST 2019 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Update to 0.18.0:
  - 0.18.0
    - Added placeholder expression for zero-based item index: {n}
      and {+n} fzf --preview 'echo {n}: {}'
    - Added color option for the gutter: --color gutter:-1
    - Added --no-unicode option for drawing borders in
      non-Unicode, ASCII characters
    - FZF_PREVIEW_LINES and FZF_PREVIEW_COLUMNS are exported to
      preview process fzf still overrides LINES and COLUMNS as
      before, but they may be reset by the default shell.
    - Bug fixes and improvements See
      https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/milestone/14?closed=1

Mon Jun 11 02:59:21 UTC 2018 - avindra@opensuse.org

- update to 0.17.4
  * Added --layout option with a new layout called reverse-list.
    --layout=reverse is a synonym for --reverse
    --layout=default is a synonym for --no-reverse
  * Preview window will be updated even when there is no match for
    the query if any of the placeholder expressions (e.g. {q}, {+})
    evaluates to a non-empty string.
  * More keys for binding: shift-{up,down}, alt-{up,down,left,
    right}
  * fzf can now start when /dev/tty is not available by making
    an educated guess.
  * bash/zsh completion improvements
  * install and uninstall scripts support generating files under
    XDG_CONFIG_HOME on --xdg flag.
