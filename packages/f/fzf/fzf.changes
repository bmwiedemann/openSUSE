- Update to 0.19.0
  - Added --phony option which completely disables search functionality.
    Useful when you want to use fzf only as a selector interface. See below.
  - Added "reload" action for dynamically updating the input list without
    restarting fzf. See https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/issues/1750 to
    learn more about it.
  - --multi now takes an optional integer argument which indicates the
    maximum number of items that can be selected
  - If a placeholder expression for --preview and execute action
    (and the new reload action) contains f flag, it is replaced to
    the path of a temporary file that holds the evaluated list.
    This is useful when you multi-select a large number of items
    and the length of the evaluated string may exceed ARG_MAX.
  - deselect-all no longer deselects unmatched items. It is now
    consistent with select-all and toggle-all in that it only affects
    matched items.
  - Due to the limitation of bash, fuzzy completion is enabled by
    default for a fixed set of commands. A helper function for easily
    setting up fuzzy completion for any command is now provided.
  - Info line style can be changed by --info=STYLE
  - Preview window border can be disabled by adding noborder to --preview-window.
  - When you transform the input with --with-nth, the trailing white spaces are removed.
  - ctrl-\, ctrl-], ctrl-^, and ctrl-/ can now be used with --bind
  - See https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/milestone/15?closed=1 for more details

- Update to 0.18.0:
  - 0.18.0
    - Added placeholder expression for zero-based item index: {n}
      and {+n} fzf --preview 'echo {n}: {}'
    - Added color option for the gutter: --color gutter:-1
    - Added --no-unicode option for drawing borders in
      non-Unicode, ASCII characters
    - FZF_PREVIEW_LINES and FZF_PREVIEW_COLUMNS are exported to
      preview process fzf still overrides LINES and COLUMNS as
      before, but they may be reset by the default shell.

- update to 0.17.4
  * Added --layout option with a new layout called reverse-list.
    --layout=reverse is a synonym for --reverse
    --layout=default is a synonym for --no-reverse
  * Preview window will be updated even when there is no match for
    the query if any of the placeholder expressions (e.g. {q}, {+})
    evaluates to a non-empty string.
  * More keys for binding: shift-{up,down}, alt-{up,down,left,
    right}
  * fzf can now start when /dev/tty is not available by making
    an educated guess.
  * bash/zsh completion improvements
  * install and uninstall scripts support generating files under
    XDG_CONFIG_HOME on --xdg flag.
