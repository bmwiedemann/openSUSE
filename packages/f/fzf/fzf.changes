Mon Jul  8 14:09:41 UTC 2024 - Joshua Smith <smolsheep@opensuse.org>

- Add new "v" prefix to tag in URL
- Update to 0.54.0:
  * Implemented line wrap of long items
  * Updated shell integration scripts to leverage line wrap
  * Added --info-command option for customizing the info line
  * Pointer and marker signs can be set to empty strings
  * Better cache management and improved rendering for --tail
  * Improved --sync behavior: When --sync is provided, fzf will not
    render the interface until the initial filtering and the
    associated actions (bound to any of start, load, result, or
    focus) are complete.
  * GET endpoint is now available from execute and transform
    actions (it used to timeout due to lock conflict)
  * Added offset-middle action to place the current item is in the
    middle of the screen
  * fzf will not start the initial reader when reload or
    reload-sync is bound to start event. fzf < /dev/null or : | fzf
    are no longer required and extraneous load event will not fire
    due to the empty list.
  * Fixed crash when using --tiebreak=end with very long items
  * zsh 5.0 compatibility
  * Fixed --walker-skip to also skip symlinks to directories
  * Fixed result event not fired when input stream is not complete
  * New tags will have v prefix

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun  6 13:47:28 UTC 2024 - Joshua Smith <smolsheep@opensuse.org>

- Update to 0.53.0:
  * fzf can now display multi-line items. To disable multi-line
    display, use --no-multi-line
  * CTRL-R bindings of bash, zsh, and fish have been updated to
    leverage multi-line display
  * The default --pointer and --marker have been changed from > to
    Unicode bar characters as they look better with multi-line
    items
  * Added --marker-multi-line to customize the select marker for
    multi-line entries with the default set to ╻┃╹
  * Added --tmux option to replace fzf-tmux script and simplify
    distribution
  * Added support for endless input streams. Added --tail=NUM
    option to limit the number of items to keep in memory. This is
    useful when you want to browse an endless stream of data (e.g.
    log stream) with fzf while limiting memory usage.
  * man page is now embedded in the binary; fzf --man to see it
  * Changed the default --scroll-off to 3, as we think it's a
    better default
  * Process started by execute action now directly writes to and
    reads from /dev/tty. Manual /dev/tty redirection for
    interactive programs is no longer required.
  * Added print(...) action to queue an arbitrary string to be
    printed on exit. This was mainly added to work around the
    limitation of --expect where it's not compatible with --bind on
    the same key and it would ignore other actions bound to it.
  * NO_COLOR environment variable is now respected. If the variable
    is set, fzf defaults to --no-color unless otherwise specified.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May  7 15:55:13 UTC 2024 - Joshua Smith <smolsheep@opensuse.org>

- Update to 0.52.0:
  * Added --highlight-line to highlight the whole current line (à
    la set cursorline of Vim)
  * Added color names for selected lines: selected-fg, selected-bg,
    and selected-hl
  * Added click-header event that is triggered when the header
    section is clicked. When the event is triggered,
    $FZF_CLICK_HEADER_COLUMN and $FZF_CLICK_HEADER_LINE are set.
  * Add $FZF_COMPLETION_{DIR,PATH}_OPTS for separately
    customizing the behavior of fuzzy completion
  * Bug fixes and improvements
  * The code was heavily refactored to allow using fzf as a library
    in Go programs. The API is still experimental and subject to
    change.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May  1 10:57:38 UTC 2024 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@cepl.eu>

- Update to 0.51.0:
  - Added a new environment variable $FZF_POS exported to the
    child processes. It's the vertical position of the cursor in
    the list starting from 1.
    # Toggle selection to the top or to the bottom
    seq 30 | fzf --multi --bind 'load:pos(10)' \
      --bind 'shift-up:transform:for _ in $(seq $FZF_POS $FZF_MATCH_COUNT); do echo -n +toggle+up; done' \
      --bind 'shift-down:transform:for _ in $(seq 1 $FZF_POS); do echo -n +toggle+down; done'
  - Added --with-shell option to start child processes with a
    custom shell command and flags
    gem list | fzf --with-shell 'ruby -e' \
      --preview 'pp Gem::Specification.find_by_name({1})' \
      --bind 'ctrl-o:execute-silent:
          spec = Gem::Specification.find_by_name({1})
          [spec.homepage, *spec.metadata.filter { _1.end_with?("uri") }.values].uniq.each do
            system "open", _1
          end
      '
  - Added change-multi action for dynamically changing --multi option
        change-multi - enable multi-select mode with no limit
        change-multi(NUM) - enable multi-select mode with a limit
        change-multi(0) - disable multi-select mode
  - Bug fixes and improvements

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr 24 10:21:09 UTC 2024 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@cepl.eu>

- Rearranging and renaming shell-related subpackages (reaction to
  the discussion gh#akinomyoga/ble.sh$441 and
  https://github.com/junegunn/fzf?tab=readme-ov-file#setting-up-shell-integration).
- Shell subpackages should be Enahncing (not Supplementing) fzf.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Apr 14 17:27:27 UTC 2024 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@cepl.eu>

- Update to version 0.50.0:
  - Search performance optimization. You can observe 50%+
    improvement in some scenarios.
  - Added jump and jump-cancel events that are triggered when
    leaving jump mode
  - Added a new environment variable $FZF_KEY exported to the
    child processes. It's the name of the last key pressed.
  - fzf can be built with profiling options. See BUILD.md for
    more information.
  - Bug fixes

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr  4 19:01:56 UTC 2024 - Joshua Smith <smolsheep@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 0.49.0:
  * Ingestion performance improved by around 40% (more or less
    depending on options)
  * --info=hidden and --info=inline-right will no longer hide the
    horizontal separator by default. This gives you more
    flexibility in customizing the layout.
  * Added two environment variables exported to the child
    processes. FZF_PREVIEW_LABEL and FZF_BORDER_LABEL.
  * Renamed track action to track-current to highlight the
    difference between the global tracking state set by --track and
    a one-off tracking action. track is still available as an
    alias.
  * Added untrack-current and toggle-track-current actions
  * Bug fixes and minor improvements

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr  1 21:34:56 UTC 2024 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@cepl.eu>

- Revendor

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Mar 17 13:26:10 UTC 2024 - Joshua Smith <smolsheep@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 0.48.1:

Wed Mar 13 17:37:01 UTC 2024 - Joshua Smith <smolsheep@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 0.48.0:
  * Shell integration scripts are now embedded in the fzf binary.
    This simplifies the distribution, and the users are less likely
    to have problems caused by using incompatible scripts and
    binaries.
  * Added options for customizing the behavior of the built-in
    walker
  * Shell integration scripts have been updated to use the built-in
    walker with these new options and they are now much faster out
    of the box.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Mar 10 19:38:03 UTC 2024 - Joshua Smith <jsmithfpv@gmail.com>

- Update to version 0.47.0:
  * Replaced default find command with built-in directory walker
    to simplify the code and to achieve better performance. This
    doesn't affect you if you have $FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND set.
  * Added $FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS_FILE to allow managing default options
    in a file
  * Bug fixes and improvements.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

  * Bug fixes

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan  1 06:54:30 UTC 2024 - Joshua Smith <jsmithfpv@gmail.com>

- Update to version 0.45.0:
  * Added transform action to conditionally perform a set of
    actions
  * Added placeholder expressions like {fzf:query}
  * Added support for negative height
  * Added accept-or-print-query action that acts like accept but
    prints the current query when there's no match for the query
  * Added show-header and hide-header actions
  * Bug fixes

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Nov 18 06:30:35 UTC 2023 - Joshua Smith <jsmithfpv@gmail.com>

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun  9 03:32:26 UTC 2023 - Joshua Smith <jsmithfpv@gmail.com>

- Update to version 0.41.1:
  * Fixed a bug where preview window is not updated when
    --disabled is set and a reload is triggered by change:reload
    binding
  * Added fix-go-test.patch to make test cases work on 0.41.1

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Apr 30 21:45:37 UTC 2023 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.40.0:
  - Added `zero` event that is triggered when there's no match
    ```sh
    # Reload the candidate list when there's no match
    echo $RANDOM | fzf --bind 'zero:reload(echo $RANDOM)+clear-query' --height 3
    ```
  - New actions
      - Added `track` action which makes fzf track the current item when the
        search result is updated. If the user manually moves the cursor, or the
        item is not in the updated search result, tracking is automatically
        disabled. Tracking is useful when you want to see the surrounding items
        by deleting the query string.
        ```sh
        # Narrow down the list with a query, point to a command,
        # and hit CTRL-T to see its surrounding commands.
        export FZF_CTRL_R_OPTS="
          --preview 'echo {}' --preview-window up:3:hidden:wrap
          --bind 'ctrl-/:toggle-preview'
          --bind 'ctrl-t:track+clear-query'
          --bind 'ctrl-y:execute-silent(echo -n {2..} | pbcopy)+abort'
          --color header:italic
          --header 'Press CTRL-Y to copy command into clipboard'"
        ```
      - Added `change-header(...)`
      - Added `transform-header(...)`
      - Added `toggle-track` action
  - Fixed `--track` behavior when used with `--tac`
      - However, using `--track` with `--tac` is not recommended. The resulting
        behavior can be very confusing.
  - Bug fixes and improvements

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr 19 04:26:40 UTC 2023 - Luciano Santos <luc14n0@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 0.39.0:
  * Added 'one' event that is triggered when there's only one
    match.
  * Added --track option that makes fzf track the current selection
    when the result list is updated. This can be useful when
    browsing logs using fzf with sorting disabled.
  * If you use --listen option without a port number fzf will
    automatically allocate an available port and export it as
    $FZF_PORT environment variable.
  * A carriage return and a line feed character will be rendered as
    dim ␍ and ␊ respectively.
  * fzf will stop rendering a non-displayable characters as a
    space. This will likely cause less glitches in the preview
    window.
  * Other bug fixes and improvements.
- Update vendor tarball.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 13 06:03:51 UTC 2023 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- All those completion scripts not requiring their respective
  shells is a bit ridiculous.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb 17 13:29:54 UTC 2023 - Soc Virnyl Estela <socvirnyl.estela@gmail.com>

- Disable LTO
- Replace unused RPM_OPT_FLAGS
- Update to version 0.38.0:
  * New actions
    - become(...) - Replace the current fzf process with the specified command using execve(2) system call.
      See https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#turning-into-a-different-process for more information.
        # Open selected files in Vim
        fzf --multi --bind 'enter:become(vim {+})'

        # Open the file in Vim and go to the line
        git grep --line-number . |
        fzf --delimiter : --nth 3.. --bind 'enter:become(vim {1} +{2})'
      >> this action is not supported on Windows
    - show-preview
    - hide-preview
  * Bug fixes
    - --preview-window 0,hidden should not execute the preview command until toggle-preview action is triggered

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb  6 11:01:26 UTC 2023 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Update to 0.37.0:
  - Added a way to customize the separator of inline info
    fzf --info 'inline: ╱ ' --prompt '╱ ' --color prompt:bright-yellow
  - New event
        focus - Triggered when the focus changes due to a vertical cursor
        movement or a search result update

        fzf --bind 'focus:transform-preview-label:echo [ {} ]' --preview 'cat {}'

        # Any action bound to the event runs synchronously and thus can make the interface sluggish
        # e.g. lolcat isn't one of the fastest programs, and every cursor movement in
        #      fzf will be noticeably affected by its execution time
        fzf --bind 'focus:transform-preview-label:echo [ {} ] | lolcat -f' --preview 'cat {}'

        # Beware not to introduce an infinite loop
        seq 10 | fzf --bind 'focus:up' --cycle
    - New actions
        change-border-label
        change-preview-label
        transform-border-label
        transform-preview-label
    - Bug fixes and improvements
- Update to 0.36.0:
  - Added --listen=HTTP_PORT option to start HTTP server. It allows external
    processes to send actions to perform via POST method.

    # Start HTTP server on port 6266
    fzf --listen 6266

    # Send actions to the server
    curl localhost:6266 -d 'reload(seq 100)+change-prompt(hundred> )'

  - Added draggable scrollbar to the main search window and the preview window

    # Hide scrollbar
    fzf --no-scrollbar

    # Customize scrollbar
    fzf --scrollbar ┆ --color scrollbar:blue

  - New event
        Added load event that is triggered when the input stream is complete
        and the initial processing of the list is complete.

        # Change the prompt to "loaded" when the input stream is complete
        (seq 10; sleep 1; seq 11 20) | fzf --prompt 'Loading> ' --bind 'load:change-prompt:Loaded> '

        # You can use it instead of 'start' event without `--sync` if asynchronous
        # trigger is not an issue.
        (seq 10; sleep 1; seq 11 20) | fzf --bind 'load:last'

  - New actions
        Added pos(...) action to move the cursor to the numeric position
            first and last are equivalent to pos(1) and pos(-1) respectively

        # Put the cursor on the 10th item
        seq 100 | fzf --sync --bind 'start:pos(10)'

        # Put the cursor on the 10th to last item
        seq 100 | fzf --sync --bind 'start:pos(-10)'

        Added reload-sync(...) action which replaces the current list only after
        the reload process is complete. This is useful when the command takes
        a while to produce the initial output and you don't want fzf to run against
        an empty list while the command is running.

        # You can still filter and select entries from the initial list for 3 seconds
        seq 100 | fzf --bind 'load:reload-sync(sleep 3; seq 1000)+unbind(load)'

        Added next-selected and prev-selected actions to move between selected
        items

        # `next-selected` will move the pointer to the next selected item below the current line
        # `prev-selected` will move the pointer to the previous selected item above the current line
        seq 10 | fzf --multi --bind ctrl-n:next-selected,ctrl-p:prev-selected

        # Both actions respect --layout option
        seq 10 | fzf --multi --bind ctrl-n:next-selected,ctrl-p:prev-selected --layout reverse

        Added change-query(...) action that simply changes the query string to the
        given static string. This can be useful when used with --listen.

        curl localhost:6266 -d "change-query:$(date)"

        Added transform-prompt(...) action for transforming the prompt string
        using an external command

        # Press space to change the prompt string using an external command
        # (only the first line of the output is taken)
        fzf --bind 'space:reload(ls),load:transform-prompt(printf "%s> " "$(date)")'

        Added transform-query(...) action for transforming the query string using
        an external command

        # Press space to convert the query to uppercase letters
        fzf --bind 'space:transform-query(tr "[:lower:]" "[:upper:]" <<< {q})'

        # Bind it to 'change' event for automatic conversion
        fzf --bind 'change:transform-query(tr "[:lower:]" "[:upper:]" <<< {q})'

        # Can only type numbers
        fzf --bind 'change:transform-query(sed "s/[^0-9]//g" <<< {q})'

        put action can optionally take an argument string

        # a will put 'alpha' on the prompt, ctrl-b will put 'bravo'
        fzf --bind 'a:put+put(lpha),ctrl-b:put(bravo)'

    - Added color name preview-label for --preview-label
      (defaults to label for --border-label)
    - Better support for (Windows) terminals where
      each box-drawing character takes 2 columns. Set
      RUNEWIDTH_EASTASIAN environment variable to 1.
        On Vim, the variable will be automatically set if &ambiwidth is double
    - Behavior changes
        fzf will always execute the preview command if the command template
        contains {q} even when it's empty. If you prefer the old behavior,
        you'll have to check if {q} is empty in your command.

        # This will show // even when the query is empty
        : | fzf --preview 'echo /{q}/'

        # But if you don't want it,
        : | fzf --preview '[ -n {q} ] || exit; echo /{q}/'

        double-click will behave the same as enter unless otherwise specified,
        so you don't have to repeat the same action twice in --bind in most cases.

        # No need to bind 'double-click' to the same action
        fzf --bind 'enter:execute:less {}' # --bind 'double-click:execute:less {}'

        If the color for separator is not specified, it will default to the
        color for border. Same holds true for scrollbar. This is to reduce
        the number of configuration items required to achieve a consistent color
        scheme.
        If follow flag is specified in --preview-window option, fzf will
        automatically scroll to the bottom of the streaming preview output. But
        when the user manually scrolls the window, the following stops. With
        this version, fzf will resume following if the user scrolls the window
        to the bottom.
        Default border style on Windows is changed to sharp because some
        Windows terminals are not capable of displaying rounded border
        characters correctly.
    - Minor bug fixes and improvements

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Dec 18 19:02:54 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 0.35.1:
  * Fixed a bug where fzf with `--tiebreak=chunk` crashes on inverse match
    query
  * Fixed a bug where clicking above fzf would paste escape sequences

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov 11 16:41:17 UTC 2022 - Jorik Cronenberg <jorik.cronenberg@suse.com>

- Update to 0.35.0:
  * Added start event that is triggered only once when fzf finder
    starts. Since fzf consumes the input stream asynchronously,
    the input list is not available unless you use --sync.

    seq 100 | fzf --multi --sync --bind 'start:last+select-all+preview(echo welcome)'

  * Added --border-label and --border-label-pos for putting label
    on the border

    # ANSI color codes are supported
    # (with https://github.com/busyloop/lolcat)
    label=$(curl -s http://metaphorpsum.com/sentences/1 | lolcat -f)

    # Border label at the center
    fzf --height=10 --border --border-label="╢ $label ╟" \
    --color=label:italic:black

    # Left-aligned (positive integer)
    fzf --height=10 --border --border-label="╢ $label ╟" \
    --border-label-pos=3 --color=label:italic:black

    # Right-aligned (negative integer) on the bottom line (:bottom)
    fzf --height=10 --border --border-label="╢ $label ╟" \
    --border-label-pos=-3:bottom --color=label:italic:black

  * Also added --preview-label and --preview-label-pos for the
    border of the preview window

    fzf --preview 'cat {}' --border --preview-label=' Preview ' \
    --preview-label-pos=2

  * Info panel (match counter) will be followed by a horizontal separator
    by default
    - Use --no-separator or --separator='' to hide the separator
    - You can specify an arbitrary string that is repeated to form the
      horizontal separator. e.g. --separator=╸
    - The color of the separator can be customized via --color=separator:...
    - ANSI color codes are also supported

    fzf --separator=╸ --color=separator:green
    fzf --separator=$(lolcat -f -F 1.4 <<< ▁▁▂▃▄▅▆▆▅▄▃▂▁▁) --info=inline

  * Added --border=bold and --border=double along with
    --preview-window=border-bold and --preview-window=border-double

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 28 22:54:30 UTC 2022 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Update to 0.34.0:
  - Added support for adaptive --height. If the --height value is prefixed
    with ~, fzf will automatically determine the height in the range according
    to the input size.

    seq 1 | fzf --height ~70% --border --padding 1 --margin 1
    seq 10 | fzf --height ~70% --border --padding 1 --margin 1
    seq 100 | fzf --height ~70% --border --padding 1 --margin 1

      - There are a few limitations
        - Not compatible with percent top/bottom margin/padding

            # This is not allowed (top/bottom margin in percent value)
            fzf --height ~50% --border --margin 5%,10%

            # This is allowed (top/bottom margin in fixed value)
            fzf --height ~50% --border --margin 2,10%

         - fzf will not start until it can determine the right height for the input

            # fzf will open immediately
            (sleep 2; seq 10) | fzf --height 50%

            # fzf will open after 2 seconds
            (sleep 2; seq 10) | fzf --height ~50%
            (sleep 2; seq 1000) | fzf --height ~50%

  - Fixed tcell renderer used to render full-screen fzf on Windows
    --no-clear is deprecated. Use reload action instead.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep  5 14:04:02 UTC 2022 - Jorik Cronenberg <jorik.cronenberg@suse.com>

- Update to 0.33.0:
  - Added --scheme=[default|path|history] option to choose scoring scheme
    - (Experimental)
    - We updated the scoring algorithm in 0.32.0, however we have learned that
      this new scheme (default) is not always giving the optimal result
    - path: Additional bonus point is only given to the the characters after
      path separator. You might want to choose this scheme if you have many
      files with spaces in their paths.
    - history: No additional bonus points are given so that we give more
      weight to the chronological ordering. This is equivalent to the scoring
      scheme before 0.32.0. This also sets --tiebreak=index.

  - ANSI color sequences with colon delimiters are now supported.
     printf "\e[38;5;208mOption 1\e[m\nOption 2" | fzf --ansi
     printf "\e[38:5:208mOption 1\e[m\nOption 2" | fzf --ansi

  - Support border-{up,down} as the synonyms for border-{top,bottom} in
    --preview-window
  - Added support for ANSI strikethrough
     printf "\e[9mdeleted" | fzf --ansi
     fzf --color fg+:strikethrough

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug  3 14:31:08 UTC 2022 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Update to 0.32.0:
  - Updated the scoring algorithm
    - Different bonus points to different categories of word
      boundaries (listed higher to lower bonus point)
      - Word after whitespace characters or beginning of the string
      - Word after common delimiter characters (/,:;|)
      - Word after other non-word characters
      # foo/bar.sh` is preferred over `foo-bar.sh` on `bar`
      fzf --query=bar --height=4 << EOF
      foo-bar.sh
      foo/bar.sh
      EOF
  - Added a new tiebreak chunk
    - Favors the line with shorter matched chunk. A chunk is a
      set of consecutive non-whitespace characters.
    - Unlike the default length, this scheme works well with
      tabular input
        # length prefers item #1, because the whole line is shorter,
        # chunk prefers item #2, because the matched chunk ("foo") is shorter
        fzf --height=6 --header-lines=2 --tiebreak=chunk --reverse --query=fo << "EOF"
        N | Field1 | Field2 | Field3
        - | ------ | ------ | ------
        1 | hello  | foobar | baz
        2 | world  | foo    | bazbaz
        EOF
     - If the input does not contain any spaces, chunk is
       equivalent to length. But we're not going to set it as the
       default because it is computationally more expensive.
  - Bug fixes and improvements

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul 21 16:17:24 UTC 2022 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Update to 0.31.0:
  - Added support for an alternative preview window layout that
    is activated when the size of the preview window is smaller
    than a certain threshold.

    # If the width of the preview window is smaller than 50 columns,
    # it will be displayed above the search window.
    fzf --preview 'cat {}' --preview-window 'right,50%,border-left,<50(up,30%,border-bottom)'

    # Or you can just hide it like so
    fzf --preview 'cat {}' --preview-window '<50(hidden)'

  - fzf now uses SGR mouse mode to properly support mouse on
    larger terminals
  - You can now use characters that do not satisfy
    unicode.IsGraphic constraint for --marker, --pointer, and
    --ellipsis. Allows Nerd Fonts and stuff.
    Use at your own risk.
  - Bug fixes and improvements
  - Shell extension
      kill completion now requires trigger sequence (**) for
      consistency

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun 22 11:08:05 UTC 2022 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Supplement fzf-bash-completion against bash-completion, not bash.

- update to 0.30.0:
  * Fixed cursor flickering over the screen by hiding it during rendering
  * Added --ellipsis option. You can take advantage of it to make fzf
    effectively search non-visible parts of the item.
  * Added rebind action for restoring bindings after unbind
  * Switching between Ripgrep mode and fzf mode
  * Bug fixes and improvements

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Dec 24 22:54:43 UTC 2021 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Update to 0.29.0:
  - Added `change-preview(...)` action to change the `--preview` command
      - cf. `preview(...)` is a one-off action that doesn't change the
        default preview command
  - Added `change-preview-window(...)` action
      - You can rotate through the different options separated by `|`
        ```sh
        fzf --preview 'cat {}' --preview-window right:40% \
            --bind 'ctrl-/:change-preview-window(right,70%|down,40%,border-top|hidden|)'
        ```
  - Fixed rendering of the prompt line when overflow occurs with
    `--info=inline`

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Nov 13 19:44:54 UTC 2021 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

  * Added `--header-first` option to print header before the prompt line
  * Added `--scroll-off=LINES` option
  * Fixed bug where preview window is not updated on `reload`
  * fzf on Windows will also use `$SHELL` to execute external programs

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct 15 16:01:21 UTC 2021 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Update to 0.27.3:
  - Preview window is `hidden` by default when there are `preview` bindings but
    `--preview` command is not given
  - Fixed bug where `{n}` is not properly reset on `reload`
  - Fixed bug where spinner is not displayed on `reload`
  - Enhancements in tcell renderer for Windows (#2616)
  - Vim plugin
      - `sinklist` is added as a synonym to `sink*` so that it's
        easier to add a function to a spec dictionary
        ```vim
        let spec = { 'source': 'ls', 'options': ['--multi', '--preview', 'cat {}'] }
        function spec.sinklist(matches)
          echom string(a:matches)
        endfunction
  
        call fzf#run(fzf#wrap(spec))
        ```
  - Vim 7 compatibility
- Set FZF_VERSION and FZF_REVISION environment variables as well.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun  1 08:37:07 UTC 2021 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Update to 0.27.2:
  - 16 base ANSI colors can be specified by their names

    fzf --color fg:3,fg+:11
    fzf --color fg:yellow,fg+:bright-yellow

  - Fix bug where --read0 not properly displaying long lines

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat May 22 08:33:37 UTC 2021 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Update to 0.27.1:
  - Added unbind action. In the following Ripgrep launcher
    example, you can use unbind(reload) to switch to fzf-only
    filtering mode.
    See https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/blob/master/ADVANCED.md#switching-to-fzf-only-search-mode
  - Vim plugin will stop immediately even when the source command hasn't finished

    " fzf will read the stream file while allowing other processes to append to it
    call fzf#run(fzf#wrap({'source': 'cat /dev/null > /tmp/stream; tail -f /tmp/stream'}))

  - It is now possible to open popup window relative to the currrent window

    let g:fzf_layout = { 'window': { 'width': 0.9, 'height': 0.6, 'relative': v:true, 'yoffset': 1.0 } }

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr  8 12:20:29 UTC 2021 - Paolo Stivanin <info@paolostivanin.com>

- Update to 0.27.0:
  - More border options for `--preview-window`
    ```sh
    fzf --preview 'cat {}' --preview-window border-left
    fzf --preview 'cat {}' --preview-window border-left --border horizontal
    fzf --preview 'cat {}' --preview-window top:border-bottom
    fzf --preview 'cat {}' --preview-window top:border-horizontal
    ```
  - Automatically set `/dev/tty` as STDIN on execute action
    ```sh
    # Redirect /dev/tty to suppress "Vim: Warning: Input is not from a terminal"
    # ls | fzf --bind "enter:execute(vim {} < /dev/tty)"

    # "< /dev/tty" part is no longer needed
    ls | fzf --bind "enter:execute(vim {})"
    ```
  - Bug fixes and improvements
  
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Mar 13 11:18:28 UTC 2021 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Update to 0.26.0:
  - Added support for fixed header in preview window
    # Display top 3 lines as the fixed header
    fzf --preview 'bat --style=header,grid --color=always {}' --preview-window '~3'

    More advanced preview offset expression to better support the fixed header

    # Preview with bat, matching line in the middle of the window below
    # the fixed header of the top 3 lines
    #
    #   ~3    Top 3 lines as the fixed header
    #   +{2}  Base scroll offset extracted from the second field
    #   +3    Extra offset to compensate for the 3-line header
    #   /2    Put in the middle of the preview area
    #
    git grep --line-number '' |
      fzf --delimiter : \
          --preview 'bat --style=full --color=always --highlight-line {2} {1}' \
          --preview-window '~3:+{2}+3/2'
  - Added select and deselect action for unconditionally selecting or
    deselecting a single item in --multi mode. Complements toggle action.
  - Sigificant performance improvement in ANSI code processing
  - Bug fixes and improvements

  - Bug fixes and improvements

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jan  3 07:16:34 UTC 2021 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Text attributes set in --color are not reset when fzf sees another
  --color option for the same element. This allows you to put custom
  text attributes in your $FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS and still have those
  attributes even when you override the colors.

  # Default colors and attributes
  fzf

  # Apply custom text attributes
  export FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS='--color fg+:italic,hl:-1:underline,hl+:-1:reverse:underline'

  fzf

  # Different colors but you still have the attributes
  fzf --color hl:176,hl+:177

  # Write "regular" if you want to clear the attributes
  fzf --color hl:176:regular,hl+:177:regular

- Renamed --phony to --disabled

- You can dynamically enable and disable the search functionality using
  the new enable-search, disable-search, and toggle-search actions

- You can assign a different color to the query string for when search
  is disabled

  fzf --color query:#ffffff,disabled:#999999 --bind space:toggle-search

- Added last action to move the cursor to the last match
      The opposite action top is renamed to first, but top is still
      recognized as a synonym for backward compatibility

- Added preview-top and preview-bottom actions

- Extended support for alt key chords: alt with any case-sensitive
  single character

  fzf --bind alt-,:first,alt-.:last

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- Update to 24.4.4:
  - Added --preview-window option follow
    # Preview window will automatically scroll to the bottom
    fzf --preview-window follow --preview 'for i in $(seq 100000); do
      echo "$i"
      sleep 0.01
      (( i % 300 == 0 )) && printf "\033[2J"
    done'

  - Bug fixes and improvements

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Oct 24 22:08:02 UTC 2020 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Update to 0.24.1:
  - Real-time rendering of preview window
    # fzf can render preview window before the command completes
    fzf --preview 'sleep 1; for i in $(seq 100); do echo $i; sleep 0.01; done'

    # Preview window can process ANSI escape sequence (CSI 2 J) for clearing the display
    fzf --preview 'for i in $(seq 100000); do
      (( i % 200 == 0 )) && printf "\033[2J"
      echo "$i"
      sleep 0.01
    done'

  - To indicate if --multi mode is enabled, fzf will print the number of
    selected items even when no item is selected

    seq 100 | fzf
      # 100/100
    seq 100 | fzf --multi
      # 100/100 (0)

      fzf --delimiter : \
          --preview 'bat --style=numbers --color=always --highlight-line {2} {1}' \
          --preview-window +{2}-/2

  - Added --preview-window option for sharp edges (--preview-window
    sharp)

    --preview-window noborder is used
  - Added actions for preview window
        preview-half-page-up
        preview-half-page-down
  - Vim
    - Popup width and height can be given in absolute integer values
    - Added fzf#exec() function for getting the path of fzf executable
      It also downloads the latest binary if it's not available by
      running ./install --bin

-------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jan  4 16:48:23 CET 2020 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Update to 0.20.0:
  - Customizable preview window color (preview-fg and preview-bg
    for --color)

    fzf --preview 'cat {}' \
        --color 'fg:#bbccdd,fg+:#ddeeff,bg:#334455,preview-bg:#223344,border:#778899' \
        --border --height 20 --layout reverse --info inline

    Removed the immediate flicking of the screen on reload action.

    : | fzf --bind 'change:reload:seq {q}' --phony

    Added clear-query and clear-selection actions for --bind

  - It is now possible to split a composite bind action over
    multiple --bind expressions by prefixing the later ones with
    +.

    fzf --bind 'ctrl-a:up+up'

    # Can be now written as
    fzf --bind 'ctrl-a:up' --bind 'ctrl-a:+up'

    # This is useful when you need to write special
    # execute/reload form (i.e. `execute:...`)
    # to avoid parse errors and add more actions to the same key
    fzf --multi --bind 'ctrl-l:select-all+execute:less {+f}' --bind 'ctrl-l:+deselect-all'

  - Fixed parse error of --bind expression where concatenated
    execute/reload action contains + character.

    fzf --multi --bind 'ctrl-l:select-all+execute(less {+f})+deselect-all'

  - Fixed bugs of reload action
    - Not triggered when there's no match even when the command
      doesn't have any placeholder expressions
    - Screen not properly cleared when --header-lines not filled
      on reload

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Nov 17 17:48:38 UTC 2019 - Ismail Dönmez <idonmez@suse.com>

- Update to 0.19.0
  - Added --phony option which completely disables search functionality.
    Useful when you want to use fzf only as a selector interface. See below.
  - Added "reload" action for dynamically updating the input list without
    restarting fzf. See https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/issues/1750 to
    learn more about it.
  - --multi now takes an optional integer argument which indicates the
    maximum number of items that can be selected
  - If a placeholder expression for --preview and execute action
    (and the new reload action) contains f flag, it is replaced to
    the path of a temporary file that holds the evaluated list.
    This is useful when you multi-select a large number of items
    and the length of the evaluated string may exceed ARG_MAX.
  - deselect-all no longer deselects unmatched items. It is now
    consistent with select-all and toggle-all in that it only affects
    matched items.
  - Due to the limitation of bash, fuzzy completion is enabled by
    default for a fixed set of commands. A helper function for easily
    setting up fuzzy completion for any command is now provided.
  - Info line style can be changed by --info=STYLE
  - Preview window border can be disabled by adding noborder to --preview-window.
  - When you transform the input with --with-nth, the trailing white spaces are removed.
  - ctrl-\, ctrl-], ctrl-^, and ctrl-/ can now be used with --bind
  - See https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/milestone/15?closed=1 for more details

-------------------------------------------------------------------

    - Added color option for the gutter: --color gutter:-1
    - Added --no-unicode option for drawing borders in
      non-Unicode, ASCII characters
    - FZF_PREVIEW_LINES and FZF_PREVIEW_COLUMNS are exported to
      preview process fzf still overrides LINES and COLUMNS as
      before, but they may be reset by the default shell.
    - Bug fixes and improvements See
      https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/milestone/14?closed=1

Mon Jun 11 02:59:21 UTC 2018 - avindra@opensuse.org

- update to 0.17.4
  * Added --layout option with a new layout called reverse-list.
    --layout=reverse is a synonym for --reverse
    --layout=default is a synonym for --no-reverse
  * Preview window will be updated even when there is no match for
    the query if any of the placeholder expressions (e.g. {q}, {+})
    evaluates to a non-empty string.
  * More keys for binding: shift-{up,down}, alt-{up,down,left,
    right}
  * fzf can now start when /dev/tty is not available by making
    an educated guess.
  * bash/zsh completion improvements
  * install and uninstall scripts support generating files under
    XDG_CONFIG_HOME on --xdg flag.
- remove sed patch for non-excecutable fix (merged upstream)
