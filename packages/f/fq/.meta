  <title>fq CLI tool and REPL for working with binary data inspired by jq
 </title>
  <description>
fq is inspired by the well known jq tool and language and allows you to work
with binary formats the same way you would using jq. In addition it can present
data like a hex viewer, transform, slice and concatenate binary data. It also
supports nested formats and has an interactive REPL with auto-completion.
