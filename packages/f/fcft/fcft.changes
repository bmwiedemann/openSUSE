Sun May  1 20:11:17 UTC 2022 - Arnav Singh <opensuse@arnavion.dev>

- Update to 3.1.1:
  * Added OT-SVG support using a bundled nanosvg as backend.
    FCFT_CAPABILITY_SVG has been added to fcft_capabilities to detect this.
  * Fixed fcft_font::name, and fcft_glyph::font_name not being set correctly
    for font collections (e.g. *.ttc files).
  * Fixed assertion inside HarfBuzz with fcft_rasterize_grapheme_ut32
    when rasterizing a glyph fails.
- Set all options and features explicitly instead of relying on auto-detection
  to ensure build fails if dependencies change.

- Leap 15.4 uses python3.6 so the python3-dataclasses is
  BuildRequired. Also, gcc-11 is enforced in Leap since gcc7 which
  is used by default is too old

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Feb  5 22:26:44 UTC 2022 - Arnav Singh <opensuse@arnavion.dev>

- Update to 3.0.1:
  * Added fcft_font.name member for the name of the primary font.
  * Added fcft_glyph.font_name member for the name of the font that the glyph
    was loaded from.
  * Added fcft_init and fcft_fini to initialize and deinitialize the library,
    which must now be called explicitly. Also, fcft_log_init has been removed,
    and logging is now initialized by fcft_init.
  * All wchar_t usage has been replaced with uint32_t. Also,
    fcft_{glyph,grapheme,text_run}_rasterize have been renamed to
    fcft_rasterize_{char,grapheme,text_run}_utf32 to emphasize this.
  * fcft_rasterize_grapheme_utf32 no longer accepts layout tags, unlike
    its predecessor fcft_grapheme_rasterize. They should be
    set using fontfeature when calling fcft_from_name.
  * Removed fcft_size_adjust.
  * Removed fcft_font.space_advance member.
  * Fixed bug in fcft_rasterize_text_run_utf32 due to uninitialized variable.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec  8 19:43:55 UTC 2021 - Arnav Singh <opensuse@arnavion.dev>

- Update to 2.5.1:
  * fcft_set_scaling_filter now applies to color bitmap fonts only,
    ie emoji fonts.
  * Fixed incorrect value of FCFT_SCALING_FILTER_CUBIC constant.
  * Fixed pixman errors and program freezes when scaling bitmap fonts to
    very small sizes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Nov 13 12:28:21 UTC 2021 - Arnav Singh <opensuse@arnavion.dev>

- Update to 2.5.0:
  * Added fcft_set_emoji_presentation that can be used to override
    emojis' default presentation style.
  * Changed fcft_*_rasterize so that emoji's default presentation is now
    accounted for when searching for a font containing the emoji codepoint,
    codepoints whose default presentation is "text" will no longer consider
    emoji fonts, and codepoints whose default presentation is "emoji" will
    no longer consider non-emoji fonts.
  * Improved handling of RTL scripts in fcft_text_run_rasterize

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct 26 05:34:54 UTC 2021 - Arnav Singh <opensuse@arnavion.dev>

- Update to 2.4.6:
  * Updated UnicodeData to 14.0
  * Fixed fcft_glyph.wc to be the Unicode codepoint instead of font index.
  * Fixed assertion in glyph_cache_resize when rasterizing a large amount of
    code points.
  * Fixed bad performance of grapheme cache when rasterizing
    many grapheme clusters.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Aug 14 16:40:38 UTC 2021 - Arnav Singh <opensuse@arnavion.dev>

- Update to 2.4.5:
  * Fixed fcft_text_run_rasterize not checking if codepoint is in
    the fontâ€™s charset before attempting shaping.
  * Fixed crash when destroying a font with a grapheme cache entry
    representing a failed grapheme glyph.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul 22 09:20:29 UTC 2021 - Arnav Singh <opensuse@arnavion.dev>

- Update to 2.4.4:
  * Fixed rendering of bitmap fonts with Freetype >= 2.11

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jul 18 16:55:32 UTC 2021 - Arnav Singh <opensuse@arnavion.dev>

- Update to 2.4.3: 
  * Fixed bitmap/aliased font glyphs being mirrored on
    big-endian architectures.
  * Fixed color font glyphs having wrong colors on big-endian architectures.
  * Fixed crash when destroying a font that failed to load
    (typically happens when there are no fonts available at all).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul  8 02:17:09 UTC 2021 - Arnav Singh <opensuse@arnavion.dev>

- Update to 2.4.2:
  * Fixed rare crash when one thread was doing a glyph cache lookup,
    while another was resizing the cache.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul  1 19:24:23 UTC 2021 - Arnav Singh <opensuse@arnavion.dev>

- Update to 2.4.1:
  * Log messages are now printed to stderr instead of stdout.
  * fcft_grapheme_rasterize() now sets a minimum grapheme column count of 2
    when the cluster ends with an Emoji variant selector (codepoint 0xFE0F).
  * Fixed compilation error when fallback definition for FCFT_EXPORT was used
    in meson.build.
