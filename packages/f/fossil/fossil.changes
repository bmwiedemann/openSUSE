- update to 2.19:
  * On file listing pages, sort filenames using the "uintnocase" collating
    sequence, so that filenames that contains embedded integers sort in numeric

- fossil 2.12.1:
  * CVE-2020-24614: Remote authenticated users with check-in or
    administrative privileges could have executed arbitrary code
    [boo#1175760]
  * Security fix in the "fossil git export" command. New
    "safety-net" features were added to prevent similar problems
    in the future.
  * Enhancements to the graph display for cases when there are
    many cherry-pick merges into a single check-in. Example
  * Enhance the fossil open command with the new --workdir option
    and the ability to accept a URL as the repository name,
    causing the remote repository to be cloned automatically. Do
    not allow "fossil open" to open in a non-empty working
    directory unless the --keep option or the new --force option
    is used.
  * Enhance the markdown formatter to more closely follow the
    CommonMark specification with regard to text
    highlighting. Underscores in the middle of identifiers (ex:
    fossil_printf()) no longer need to be escaped.
  * The markdown-to-html translator can prevent unsafe HTML (for
    example: <script>) on user-contributed pages like forum and
    tickets and wiki. The admin can adjust this behavior using the
    safe-html setting on the Admin/Wiki page. The default is to
    disallow unsafe HTML everywhere.
  * Added the "collapse" and "expand" capability for long forum
    posts.
  * The "fossil remote" command now has options for specifying
    multiple persistent remotes with symbolic names. Currently
    only one remote can be used at a time, but that might change
    in the future.
  * Add the "Remember me?" checkbox on the login page. Use a
    session cookie for the login if it is not checked.
  * Added the experimental "fossil hook" command for managing
    "hook scripts" that run before checkin or after a push.
  * Enhance the fossil revert command so that it is able to revert
    all files beneath a directory.
  * Add the fossil bisect skip command.
  * Add the fossil backup command.
  * Enhance fossil bisect ui so that it shows all unchecked
    check-ins in between the innermost "good" and "bad" check-ins.
  * Added the --reset flag to the "fossil add", "fossil rm", and
    "fossil addremove" commands.
  * Added the "--min N" and "--logfile FILENAME" flags to the
    backoffice command, as well as other enhancements to make the
    backoffice command a viable replacement for automatic
    backoffice. Other incremental backoffice improvements.
  * Added the /fileedit page, which allows editing of text files
    online. Requires explicit activation by a setup user.
  * Translate built-in help text into HTML for display on web
    pages.
  * On the /timeline webpage, the combination of query parameters
    "p=CHECKIN" and "bt=ANCESTOR" draws all ancestors of CHECKIN
    going back to ANCESTOR.
  * Update the built-in SQLite so that the "fossil sql" command
    supports new output modes ".mode box" and ".mode json".
  * Add the "obscure()" SQL function to the "fossil sql" command.
  * Added virtual tables "helptext" and "builtin" to the "fossil
    sql" command, providing access to the dispatch table including
    all help text, and the builtin data files, respectively.
  * Delta compression is now applied to forum edits.
  * The wiki editor has been modernized and is now Ajax-based.

- fossil 1.29:
  * Add the ability to display content, diffs and annotations for
    UTF16 text files in the web interface.
  * Add the "SaveAs..." and "Invert" buttons to the graphical diff
    display that results from using the --tk option with the fossil

  * Fix the server so that it avoids writing to the database (and
    thus avoids database locking issues) on a pull or clone.
  * Add support for server load management using both a cache of
    expensive pages (the fossil cache command) and by rejecting
    expensive page requests when the server load average is too
     high.
  * Add the fossil praise command as an alias for fossil blame for

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 22 07:26:09 UTC 2014 - max@suse.de

- Update to version 1.28:
  * Enhance /reports to support event type filtering.
  * When cloning a repository, the user name passed via the URL
    (if any) is now used as the default local admin user's name.
  * Enhance the SSH transport mechanism so that it runs a single
    instance of the "fossil" executable on the remote side,
    obviating the need for a shell on the remote side. Some users
    may need to add the "?fossil=/path/to/fossil" query parameter
    to "ssh:" URIs if their fossil binary is not in a standard
    place.
  * Add the "fossil blame" command that works just like "fossil
    annotate" but uses a different output format that includes the
    user who made each changes and omits line numbers.
  * Add the "Tarball and ZIP-archive Prefix" configuration
    parameter under Admin/Configuration.
  * Fix CGI processing so that it works on web servers that do not
    supply REQUEST_URI.
  * Add options --dirsonly, --emptydirs, and --allckouts to the
    "fossil clean" command.
  * Ten-fold performance improvement in large "fossil blame" or
    "fossil annotate" commands.
  * Add option -W|--width and --offset to "fossil timeline" and
    "fossil finfo" commands.
  * Option -n|--limit of "fossil timeline" now specifies the
    number of entries, just like all other commands which have the
    -n|--limit option. The various timeline-related functions now
    output "--- ?? limit (??) reached ---" at the end whenever
    appropriate. Use "-n 0" if no limit is desired.
  * Fix handling of password embedded in Fossil URL.
  * New --once option to fossil clone command which does not store
    the URL or password when cloning.
  * Modify fossil ui to respect "default user" in an open
    repository.
  * Fossil now hides check-ins that have the "hidden" tag in
    timeline webpages.
  * Enhance /ci_edit page to add the "hidden" tag to check-ins.
  * Advanced possibilities for commit and ticket change
    notifications over http using TH1 scripting.
  * Add --sha1sum and --integrate options to the "fossil commit"
    command.
  * Add the "clean" and "extra" subcommands to the "fossil all"
    command
  * Add the --whatif option to "fossil clean" that works the same
    as "--dry-run", so that the name does not collide with the
    --dry-run option of "fossil all".
  * Provide a configuration option to show dates on the web
    timeline as "YYMMMDD HH:MM"
  * Add an option to the "stats" webpage that allows an
    administrator to see the current repository schema.
  * Enhancements to the "/vdiff" webpage for more difference
    display options.
  * Added the "/tree" webpage as an alternative to "/dir" and make
    it the default way of showing file lists.
  * Send gzipped HTTP responses to clients that support it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct 15 15:31:43 UTC 2013 - max@suse.com

- Update to Version 1.27
  * Enhance the fossil changes, fossil clean, fossil extras,
    fossil ls and fossil status commands to restrict operation to
    files and directories named on the command-line.
  * New --integrate option to fossil merge, which automatically
    closes the merged branch when committing.
  * Renamed /stats_report page to /reports. Graph width is now
    relative, not absolute.
  * Added yw=YYYY-WW (year-week) filter to timeline to limit the
    results to a specific year and calendar week number,
    e.g. /timeline?yw=2013-01.
  * Updates to SQLite to prevent opening a repository file using
    file descriptors 1 or 2 on unix. This fixes a bug under which
    an assertion failure could overwrite part of a repository
    database file, corrupting it.
  * Added support for unlimited line lengths in side-by-side
    diffs.
  * New --close option to fossil commit, which immediately closes
    the branch being committed.
  * Added chart option to fossil bisect.
  * Improvements to the "human or bot?" determination.
  * Reports errors about missing CGI-standard environment
    variables for HTTP servers which do not support them.
  * Added --scgi option to fossil server.
  * Internal improvements to the sync process.
  * The internals of the JSON API are now MIT-licensed, so
    downstream users/packagers are no longer affected by the "do
    no evil" license clause.
  * The argument to the --port option for the "fossil ui" and
    "fossil server" commands can take an IP address in addition to
    the port number, causing Fossil to bind to just that one IP
    address.
  * After prompting for a password, also ask if that password
    should be remembered.
  * Performance improvements to the diff engine.
  * Fix the side-by-side diff engine to work better with
    multi-byte unicode text.
  * Color-coding in the web-based annotation (blame) display. Fix
    the annotation engine so that it is no longer confused by
    time-warps.
  * The markdown formatter is now available by default and can be
    used for tickets, wiki, and embedded documentation.
  * Add subcommands "fossil bisect log" and "fossil bisect status"
    to the "fossil bisect" command, as well as other bisect
    enhancements.
  * Enhanced defenses that prevent spiders from using excessive
    CPU and bandwidth.
  * Consistent use of the -n or --dry-run command line options.
  * Enhancements to /timeline.rss, adding more flags for filtering
    results, including the ability to subscribe to changes made to
    individual tickets.
  * Improved handling of the differences between case-sensitive
    and case-insensitive filesystems.
  * JSON API: added the 'status' command to report local checkout
    status.
  * Fixes to the --args support and documented this feature in the
    help.
  * Added /stats_report page.
  * Added ym=YYYY-MM filter to the "/timeline" url.
  * Fixed: config reset now re-installs default ticket report
    format.
  * ssh:// and file:// protocols now ignore proxy settings.
  * Added /hash-color-test web page.
  * Cherry-pick merges are recorded internally (though no yet
    displayed on the timeline graph.)
  * Bring in the latest versions of SQLite, zlib, and autosetup
    from upstream.
