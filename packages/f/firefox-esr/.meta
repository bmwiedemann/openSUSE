  <title>Mozilla Firefox Web Browser</title>
  <description>This package is based on the package 'MozillaFirefox' from project 'openSUSE:Factory'.

Mozilla Firefox, formerly known as Phoenix and Firebird, is a redesign
of the Mozilla browser component, similar to Galeon, K-Meleon and
Camino, but written using the XUL user interface language and designed
to be cross-platform. It is a stand-alone application instead of part
of the Mozilla Application Suite.
