  <title>Links substantially identical, duplicate files to save file system space.</title>
  <description>Freedup eliminates duplicate files by linking them, and thus reduces the amount
of used disk space within one or more file systems. By default, hardlinks are 
used on a single device, symbolic links when the devices differ. A set of 
options allows you to modify the methods of file comparison, the hash functions,
the linking behavior, and the reporting style. You may use batch or interactive
mode. Freedup usually only considers identical files, but when comparing audio
or graphics files, you may elect to ignore the tags. Multimedia files often are
a good target for deduplication.
