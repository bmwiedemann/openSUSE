Thu Jul  1 19:26:17 UTC 2021 - Arnav Singh <opensuse@arnavion.dev>

- Update to 1.8.1:
  * New foot.ini options:
    * cursor.beam-thickness
    * cursor.style=beam (cursor.style=bar remains a recognized value, but will
      will eventually be deprecated, and removed)
    * cursor.underline-thickness
    * underline-offset
    * csd.button-color
    * dedicated [bell] section, supporting multiple actions,      
      a new command action to run an arbitrary command and                        
      XDG activation support. The bell option has been deprecated.
    * dedicated [url] section. The jump-label-letters, osc8-underline and
      url-launch options have been deprecated in favor of options in
      this new section.
    * tweak.grapheme-shaping option to foot.ini to support                  
      grapheme cluster segmentation and grapheme shaping.
      The grapheme cluster width is limited to two cells by default,
      which may cause cursor synchronization issues with many applications.
    * tweak.grapheme-width-method=wcswidth option to stop limiting
      grapheme cluster width to two cells.
    * tweak.pua-double-width option to foot.ini to force                    
      Private Usage Area codepoints to be treated as double-width characters.
  * Added support for including files in foot.ini
  * Added support for setting the full 256 color palette in foot.ini
  * Added ctrl+c as a default key binding; to cancel search/url mode.
  * Added support for overriding configuration options on the command line.
  * Added support for DECSET/DECRST 2026, as an alternative to the existing
    "synchronized updates" DCS sequences.
  * Added support for LS2 and LS3 (locking shift) escape sequences.
  * Added OSC 9 desktop notifications (iTerm2 compatible).
  * See https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot/releases/tag/1.8.0 and
