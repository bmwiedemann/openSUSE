- Update to 1.10.0:
  * foot.ini options:

      desktop notifications should be inhibited when the terminal
      has keyboard focus.

Thu Oct 14 21:01:16 UTC 2021 - Arnav Singh <opensuse@arnavion.dev>

- Fix default TERM to be "foot" and not "foot-extra" as was intended.

- Add dependency on terminfo package since that is the package that ships
  ncurses upstream's terminfo for foot, not terminfo-base.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct  4 07:02:24 UTC 2021 - Arnav Singh <opensuse@arnavion.dev>

- Update to 1.9.2:
  * foot.ini options:
    * New tweak.font-monospace-warn option to disable new warning when
      the primary font is not monospace.
    * dpi-aware=auto option now scales fonts using the monitor's DPI only when
      all monitors have a scaling factor of one.
  * foot's custom terminfos have been moved to the foot-extra-terminfo package,
    where they have been renamed to foot-extra. By default, foot no longer
    sets TERMINFO and expects to use the terminfo shipped by ncurses. If you
    want to use the customer terminfos instead, install
    the foot-extra-terminfo package and set term=foot-extra in
    your foot config.
  * See https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot/releases/tag/1.9.1 and
    https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot/releases/tag/1.9.2 for more details.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug 27 22:17:48 UTC 2021 - Arnav Singh <opensuse@arnavion.dev>

- Update to 1.9.0:
  * foot.ini options:
    * include directives for including files now expand ~ in the path.
    * New uri.uri-characters option to customize what characters are considered
      to be part of a URL.
  * If using a compositor with client-side decorations, the CSDs now show
    window titles.
  * foot's terminfo file is now installed under /usr/share/foot/terminfo
    so as to not conflict with terminfo-base's version of the file
    under /usr/share/terminfo. foot also sets the TERMINFO env var on
    the program to /usr/share/foot/terminfo so that the program prefers to
    use the file in this directory instead of terminfo-base's version.
    This is because terminfo-base's version does not expose all the capabilities
    that foot supports.
  * See https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot/releases/tag/1.9.0 for more details.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jul 18 16:56:41 UTC 2021 - Arnav Singh <opensuse@arnavion.dev>

- Update to 1.8.2:
  * New foot.ini options:
    * locked-title option to disable dynamic changes to the window title.
    * tweak.overflowing-glyps option to fix rendering issues with glyphs of
      any width that appear cut-off. This supersedes
      the tweak.allow-overflowing-double-width-glyphs and
      tweak.pua-double-width options, which have been removed.
  * See https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot/releases/tag/1.8.2 for more details.

    * cursor.underline-thickness
    * underline-offset
    * csd.button-color
    * dedicated [bell] section, supporting multiple actions,      
      a new command action to run an arbitrary command and                        
      XDG activation support. The bell option has been deprecated.
    * dedicated [url] section. The jump-label-letters, osc8-underline and
      url-launch options have been deprecated in favor of options in
      this new section.
    * tweak.grapheme-shaping option to foot.ini to support

      grapheme cluster width to two cells.
