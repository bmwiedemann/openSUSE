Thu May  1 16:07:36 UTC 2025 - Arnav Singh <opensuse@arnavion.dev>

- Update to v1.22.3:
  * foot.ini options:
    * Disabled main.gamma-correct-blending option by default,
      since correct blending with the option enabled is slower
      (lower rendering throughput and higher input latency).
    * Changed tweak.surface-bit-depth default from "8-bit" to "auto".
      This becomes "8-bit" when main.gamma-correct-blending is "no"
      and "10-bit" when that is "yes".
  * See https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot/releases/tag/1.22.3 for more details.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr 30 08:37:51 UTC 2025 - Arnav Singh <opensuse@arnavion.dev>

- Update to v1.22.2:
  * Fixed colors to be more accurate when gamma-correct font rendering
    is active.
  * See https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot/releases/tag/1.22.2 for more details.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Apr 26 16:35:08 UTC 2025 - Arnav Singh <opensuse@arnavion.dev>

- Update to v1.22.1:
  * Fixed main.alpha-mode=matching to work for
    the default background color and indexed colors.
  * Fixed keyboard modifiers not getting reset when switching focus away
    from the foot window.
  * Fixed zero-width codepoints causing font and color of adjacent cell
    to be different from the rest.
  * Fixed alpha getting applied to inverse text and selections.
  * Added new themes: alacritty.
  * See https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot/releases/tag/1.22.1 for more details.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 17 15:02:51 UTC 2025 - Arnav Singh <opensuse@arnavion.dev>

- Update to v1.22.0:
  * foot.ini options:
    * Added main.alpha-mode option to change how alpha is handled on
      background colors not set by the terminal but by programs like vim.
      Defaults to "default", which sets the alpha only on cells with
      the terminal default background color, not including cells
      with the same RGB value as the terminal default background color.
    * Added tweak.dim-amount option to tweak how much dimmed colors are
      dimmed by when explicit values have not been configured.
      Such auto-calculated dimmed colors are now more consistent in being
      less intense and closer to black. Similarly brightened colors are
      more consistently more intense and closer to white, as determined by
      the original tweak.bold-text-in-bright-amount option.
    * Virtual modifiers in key bindings are now recognized and mapped to
      the corresponding real modifier, eg Alt instead of Mod1 and
      Super instead of Mod4.
    * Default regex used in url.regex has been changed to be much more strict.
  * Added support for compositor toplevel edge constraints to prevent
    resizing foot via its CSDs in the constrained directions. This also allows
    a tiled window to be resized via its CSDs unless the compositor has
    indicated that the toplevel has edge constraints.
  * Fixed keybindings to work under compositors like Mutter that send
    virtual modifiers in keyboard events.
  * Fixed crash in URL mode when activating a second URL.
  * Fixed URL mode to not mangle double-width characters in copied URLs.
  * Fixed issue where changing the window size would remove empty lines.
  * Added new themes: molokai, night-owl.
  * See https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot/releases/tag/1.22.0 for more details.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 17 15:50:58 UTC 2025 - Arnav Singh <opensuse@arnavion.dev>

- Update to v1.21.0:
  * foot.ini options:
    * Added bell.system option to use xdg-system-bell-v1 Wayland protocol
      to report the terminal bell. Defaults to "yes".
    * Added search-bindings.delete-to-start and .delete-to-end key bindings,
      defaulting to Ctrl+u and Ctrl+k respectively.
    * cursor.style can now be set to "hollow".
    * Added gamma-correct-blending option to use gamma-correct font rendering
      if the compositor supports wp_color_management_v1,
      specifically the ext_linear transfer function. Enabled by default when
      compositor support is available.
    * Added url.regex option to define a regex used to match URLs.
      The url.uri-characters and url-protocols options have been removed.
    * tweak.scaling-filter now supports more values when running with
      libfcft4 >= 3.3.1 - "impulse", "box", "linear", "gaussian", "lanczos2",
      "lanczos3-stretched". The scaling filter is no longer applied to
      scaled bitmap fonts when that is enabled in FontConfig.
    * Removed main.notify and main.notify-focus-when-inhibit options.
      These were deprecated in 1.18.0.
  * Fixed various issues with wrapped lines such as some such lines being
    copied as multiple lines, glitching when the window was resized, etc.
  * Fixed various issues with handling of zero-width characters,
    combining characters, etc.
  * Fixed various issues with Kitty keyboard protocol implementation.
  * Fixed wrong key bindings being executed when using
    alternative keyboard layouts.
  * Fixed various hangs, crashes and resource leaks.
  * Renamed theme tokyo-nightday to tokyo-nightlight and modified its colors.
  * See https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot/releases/tag/1.21.0 for more details.
- Remove "-Wno-error=deprecated-declarations" because issue has been
  fixed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar 13 18:05:44 UTC 2025 - Arnav Singh <opensuse@arnavion.dev>

- Temporarily disable warning-as-error for using deprecated functions,
  because foot currently uses a function that was deprecated in fcft 3.3.x

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jan 18 10:10:43 UTC 2025 - Arnav Singh <opensuse@arnavion.dev>

- Update to v1.20.2:
  * foot.ini options:
    * colors.flash-alpha can be set to 1.0 (fully opaque) again.
      The issue where this would cause window to be stuck in flash state
      has been fixed separately.
  * "Report window title" (CSI 21 t) and "Report app-id" (OSC 176 ?)
    are now ignored. This relates to CVEs reported in some other terminals
    where a malicious program / ssh remote can trick the user into running
    arbitrary commands by using these sequences to fill
    the shell input buffer.
  * Fixed a crash on startup if the compositor sent a keyboard enter event
    before the window was mapped.
  * See https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot/releases/tag/1.20.2 for more details.

Wed Jan  1 09:04:11 UTC 2025 - Arnav Singh <opensuse@arnavion.dev>

- Update to v1.20.0:
  * foot.ini options:
    * Added security.osc52 to partially or fully disable clipboard access
      via the OSC-52 escape sequence. Defaults to enabling clipboard access.
    * Various keybindings for search mode that were implemented previously but
      not documented have now been documented in the manpages.
  * Runtime changes to the window title and app ID now require the value
    to only contain printable characters.
  * Added new themes: rose-pine-dawn, rose-pine-moon.
  * Fixed various crashes.
  * See https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot/releases/tag/1.20.0 for more details.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct 23 15:35:04 UTC 2024 - Arnav Singh <opensuse@arnavion.dev>

- Update to v1.19.0:
  * foot.ini options:
    * Added main.resize-keep-grid option to control whether the window is
      resized (and the grid reflowed) or not when zooming in/out.
    * Added main.strikeout-thickness option.
    * Added colors.sixelNN options to control the default sixel color palette.
    * Changed cursor.unfocused-style option to be effective when
      cursor.style is not "block".
  * Activating a notification that was triggered by OSC-777 or BEL now focuses
    the foot window, if XDG activation tokens are supported by
    the Wayland compositor, the notification daemon and the notification helper
    set in foot's desktop-notifications.command config.
  * The .desktop files have been renamed to remove
    the "org.codeberg.dnkl." prefix.
  * Fixed crash when setting the window title to invalid UTF-8.
  * Fixed misbehavior when the scrollback.lines config was set to a value
    that caused integer overflow.
  * Fixed some visual glitches when running under compositors that forced foot
    to double-buffer (KWin, those based on Smithay, etc).
  * See https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot/releases/tag/1.19.0 for more details.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug 14 16:27:10 UTC 2024 - Arnav Singh <opensuse@arnavion.dev>

- Update to v1.18.1:
  * foot.ini options:
    * desktop-notifications.command config can now also use "${muted}"
      and "${sound-name}" in its template value.
  * CSD buttons now activate on mouse button release, rather than press.
  * Desktop notifications via OSC-99 sequence can now choose to play
    a particular sound or mute the sound.
  * Fixed bug in OSC-111 sequence used to reset background color not handling
    alpha changes correctly, causing visual glitches.
  * See https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot/releases/tag/1.18.1 for more details.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug  2 15:42:37 UTC 2024 - Arnav Singh <opensuse@arnavion.dev>

- Update to v1.18.0:
  * foot.ini options:
    * Added cursor.blink-rate option to configure the rate the cursor
      blinks with.
    * Deprecated main.notify and main.notify-focus-when-inhibit options
      and added new desktop-notifications option group.
      desktop-notifications.command option replaces main.notify option,
      and also takes some new templated parameters.
      desktop-notifications.inhibit-when-focused option replaces
      main.notify-focus-inhibit option.
  * Changed scrollback to respect high-resolution mousewheel scroll events
    on compositors that send them. scrollback.multiplier config option
    may need to be adjusted for users of mice that emit such events.
  * Mouse wheel events now generate BTN_WHEEL_BACK and BTN_WHEEL_FORWARD
    instead of BTN_BACK and BTN_FORWARD. The defaults of
    mouse-bindings.scrollback-up-mouse, .scrollback-down-mouse,
    .font-increase and .font-decrease have been updated accordingly.
    This means dedicated mouse buttons that do generate BTN_BACK and
    BTN_FORWARD can now be bound independently from the scroll wheel.
  * Added support for rendering colored and styled (wavy) underlines
    ala Kitty, double underlines, color palette stack,
    in-band resize notifications to applications and
    Kitty desktop notifications protocol.
  * Added new themes: catppuccin-frappe, catppuccin-latte,
    catppuccin-macchiato, catppuccin-mocha, nvim-dark, nvim-light.
  * Fixed various crashes, compatibility issues with terminal codes
    and other bugs.
  * See https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot/releases/tag/1.18.0 for more details.

  * Fixed syslog logging from foot-server to respect log level option.
  * Fixed terminal to not shut down until the client application exits,
    even if the client application closed the PTY.
  * When closing the window, foot now sends SIGHUP to the client application

      Ctrl / Shift / Alt / Super.
    * Added key-bindings.pipe-command-output option to copy the last command's
      output to clipboard.

      to opaque rather than transparent.
    * key-bindings.font-increase and font-decrease now include
      Ctrl+wheel up and Ctrl+wheel down by default, in addition to the existing
      Ctrl-+ and Ctrl+-.
  * Added support for opening an existing PTY, e.g. a VM console.
  * Unicode input mode now accepts input from the numpad as well,
    numlock is ignored.
  * Various changes related to ANSI escape sequences, foot-extra terminfo,
    Kitty keyboard protocol implementation, and sixels.

- Update to v1.16.0:
  * foot.ini options:
    * Mouse wheel scroll can now be bound to actions, as BTN_BACK for
      scrolling up and BTN_FORWARD for scrolling down.
    * Added mouse-bindings.scrollback-up-mouse and
      mouse-bindings.scrollback-down-mouse options to scroll contents.
      Default to BTN_BACK and BTN_FORWARD.
    * Changed default mouse-bindings.select-row from BTN_LEFT-3
      (triple left click) to BTN_LEFT-4 (quadruple left click).
    * Added mouse-bindings.select-quote option to select an entire quote and

  * Changed URL mode to not strip file:// prefix from local file URIs.
  * Changed rendering to have lower latency in many cases, especially on
    high DPI monitors.
  * Fixed wrong baseline offset for some fonts.
  * Fixed foot-server systemd units to only start after the wayland session
    is fully initialized.

    the foot.ini does not exist or cannot be parsed.
  * Fixed some crashes related to fractional scaling, XDG activation and
    search mode.
  * Added new theme - panda.
  * See https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot/releases/tag/1.16.0 for more details.

- Update to v1.15.1:
  * Background transparency (alpha) is now disabled in fullscreened windows.
  * systemd service and socket units of foot-server are no longer instanced
    on the WAYLAND_DISPLAY env var. They are now singletons and part of
    the standard graphical-session.target. This also means the socket path
    does not incorporate the WAYLAND_DISPLAY value. The list of socket paths
    that footclient tries to connect to has been updated accordingly.
  * Fixed various bugs related to fractional scaling, font sizes, and more.
  * See https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot/releases/tag/1.15.1 for more details.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul 14 15:49:39 UTC 2023 - Arnav Singh <opensuse@arnavion.dev>

    * Added csd.double-click-to-maximize option. Defaults to "yes".
    * Added touch.long-press-delay option.
    * Renamed main.utempter option to main.utmp-helper. main.utempter is still
      recognized, but will log a deprecation warning.
    * Changed default main.dpi-aware value from "auto" to "no", and "auto" is
      no longer an allowed value.
    * Default theme is now "starlight".
    * Changed default key-bindings.show-urls-launch from Ctrl-Shift-U to
      Ctrl-Shift-O.
    * Changed default key-bindings.unicode-input from none to Ctrl-Shift-U.
  * Implemented support fractional scaling on compositors that implement
    the fractional-scale-v1 Wayland protocol. This also changes how fonts
    are scaled to be based on the output scale factor configured in
    the compositor rather than the output's DPI. To restore
    the original behavior, set main.dpi-aware to "yes".
  * Implemented support server side cursor shapes on compositors that implement
    the cursor-shape-v1 Wayland protocol.
  * Implemented support for touchscreen input.
  * Implemented XTQMODKEYS query (CSI ? Pp m).
  * Added new themes - aeroroot, ayu-mirage, srcery, starlight.
  * Fixed incorrect icon in dock and window switcher on GNOME.
  * Fixed various bugs in sixel output.
  * Fixed various crashes when resizing or scrolling.

    * Added font-size-adjustment option to set the font size change increment
      when zooming in or out.
    * Added underline-thickness option to set underline height.
    * Changed default colors to correspond to the solarized-dark-normal-brights
      theme.
    * Added main.utempter option to set path to utempter binary, used to
      create utmp records. Defaults to the path of that binary at build time.
    * Changed default grapheme-width-method option to double-width.
    * Changed default pad option to 0x0.
    * String values can now be quoted with double quotes (""), which can be
      used to set an option to an empty string value. For environment variables
      setting them to the empty string unsets them.
  * Added various terminfo capabilities to work better with vim, etc.
  * Fixed various crashes.
  * Added new themes - deus, material-amber, modus, moonfly, nightfly, onedark,
    rose-pine, zenburn.
  * See https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot/releases/tag/1.14.0 for more details.

      These key bindings jump to the previous / next prompt with a cooperating
      shell.
    * Added key-bindings.unicode-input and search-bindings.unicode-input
      options. They provide a way to input unicode using codepoints without
      an external IME.
  * Client-side decorations no longer show buttons that do nothing because
    the compositor doesn't support the button's feature. For example,
    the minimize button won't be shown if the compositor doesn't support
    minimizing.
  * Added new themes - Monokai Pro, Catppuccin, Tokyo Night,
    Tokyo Night Day, Tokyo Night Storm.
  * See https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot/releases/tag/1.13.0 for more details.

- Update to v1.12.0:
  * foot.ini options:
    * Added key-bindings.scrollback-home and .scrollback-end options.
    * Added key-binding.show-urls-persistent option. This is similar to

  * See https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot/releases/tag/1.12.0 for more details.
- Set all options and features explicitly instead of relying on auto-detection
  to ensure build fails if dependencies change.
- Upstream moved default foot.ini from $datadit/foot/foot.ini
  to $sysconfdir/xdg/foot/foot.ini . Move it ourselves
  to $distconfdir/xdg/foot/foot.ini in accordance with packaging guidelines
  for new packages.

Sat Feb  5 23:01:59 UTC 2022 - Arnav Singh <opensuse@arnavion.dev>

- Update to 1.11.0:
  * foot.ini options:
    * Added mouse-bindings.selection-override-modifiers option to specify
      which modifiers should be held to force selection and prevent
      client applications from grabbing the mouse.
    * scrollback.multiplier is now also applied in alternate-scroll mode.
      The client receives multiple arrow key presses equal to
      the multiplier instead of just one.
    * key-bindings.clipboard-{copy,paste} now support
      the XF86{Copy,Paste} keycodes.
  * irc:// and ircs:// URLs are now auto-detected as URLs.
  * Added support for reporting mouse coordinates in SGR-Pixels (1016) format.
  * Added XTGETTCAP support for reporting the current terminfo to clients
    that support it instead of needing the terminfo file installed,
    say when ssh'ing to remote hosts.
  * Added partial DECRQSS support so that clients can request
    top and bottom margins (DECSTBM), graphic rendition (SGR) and
    cursor style (DECSCUSR).
  * Searching the scrollback now defaults to searching for
    the previously-searched string.
  * PaperColorDark and PaperColorLight themes have been renamed to
    paper-color-dark and paper-color-light for consistency with other themes.
  * foot will now try to change the locale to either C.UTF-8 or en_US.UTF-8
    on startup if it has been started with a non-UTF-8 locale. If it fails to
    change the locale for any reason, it will show an error and not start
    the shell / program it was supposed to.
  * Pasting or dropping files on the alternate screen no longer quotes
    the filename.
  * Copying a line-based selection now includes a trailing newline.
  * See https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot/releases/tag/1.11.0 for more details.

    * tweak.grapheme-width-method can now be set to max, which means to use
      the width of the largest codepoint in the grapheme cluster.
  * Added initial support for Kitty keyboard protocol, currently with support
    for only the "Disambiguate escape codes" mode. See Kitty keyboard protocol
    docs for more details.
  * Right-clicking the CSD title bar now informs the Wayland compositor to show
    a window context menu, if the compositor supports such a thing in general.

- Update to 1.10.0:
  * foot.ini options:
    * Added notify-focus-inhibit boolean option to control whether
      desktop notifications should be inhibited when the terminal
      has keyboard focus.

      and background colors for the scrollback indicator.
    * Added csd.border-width and csd.border-color to configure the width and
      color of the CSD border.
    * Added colors.dim0-7 options to configure custom "dim" colors.
    * Changed tweak.grapheme-shaping to be enabled by default.
    * Changed tweak.grapheme-width-method to be "wcswidth" by default.
    * All boolean options are now limited to "yes|true|on|1|no|false|off|0".
      Previously any numbers greater than 0 were treated as true, and anything
      else that wasn't "yes|true|on" was treated as false.
    * scrollback.multiplier is no longer applied when the alternate screen
      is in use.
    * Removed deprecated bell option. bell section (introduced in 1.8.0) should
      be used instead.

      osc8-underline-options options. url section (introduced in 1.8.0) should
      be used instead.

  * See https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot/releases/tag/1.10.0 for more details.

Thu Oct 14 21:01:16 UTC 2021 - Arnav Singh <opensuse@arnavion.dev>

- Fix default TERM to be "foot" and not "foot-extra" as was intended.

- Add dependency on terminfo package since that is the package that ships
  ncurses upstream's terminfo for foot, not terminfo-base.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct  4 07:02:24 UTC 2021 - Arnav Singh <opensuse@arnavion.dev>

- Update to 1.9.2:
  * foot.ini options:
    * New tweak.font-monospace-warn option to disable new warning when
      the primary font is not monospace.
    * dpi-aware=auto option now scales fonts using the monitor's DPI only when
      all monitors have a scaling factor of one.
  * foot's custom terminfos have been moved to the foot-extra-terminfo package,
    where they have been renamed to foot-extra. By default, foot no longer
    sets TERMINFO and expects to use the terminfo shipped by ncurses. If you
    want to use the customer terminfos instead, install
    the foot-extra-terminfo package and set term=foot-extra in
    your foot config.
  * See https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot/releases/tag/1.9.1 and
    https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot/releases/tag/1.9.2 for more details.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug 27 22:17:48 UTC 2021 - Arnav Singh <opensuse@arnavion.dev>

- Update to 1.9.0:
  * foot.ini options:
    * include directives for including files now expand ~ in the path.
    * New uri.uri-characters option to customize what characters are considered
      to be part of a URL.
  * If using a compositor with client-side decorations, the CSDs now show
    window titles.
  * foot's terminfo file is now installed under /usr/share/foot/terminfo
    so as to not conflict with terminfo-base's version of the file
    under /usr/share/terminfo. foot also sets the TERMINFO env var on
    the program to /usr/share/foot/terminfo so that the program prefers to
    use the file in this directory instead of terminfo-base's version.
    This is because terminfo-base's version does not expose all the capabilities
    that foot supports.
  * See https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot/releases/tag/1.9.0 for more details.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jul 18 16:56:41 UTC 2021 - Arnav Singh <opensuse@arnavion.dev>

- Update to 1.8.2:
  * New foot.ini options:
    * locked-title option to disable dynamic changes to the window title.
    * tweak.overflowing-glyps option to fix rendering issues with glyphs of
      any width that appear cut-off. This supersedes
      the tweak.allow-overflowing-double-width-glyphs and
      tweak.pua-double-width options, which have been removed.
  * See https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot/releases/tag/1.8.2 for more details.

    * cursor.underline-thickness
    * underline-offset
    * csd.button-color
    * dedicated [bell] section, supporting multiple actions,      
      a new command action to run an arbitrary command and                        
      XDG activation support. The bell option has been deprecated.
    * dedicated [url] section. The jump-label-letters, osc8-underline and
      url-launch options have been deprecated in favor of options in
      this new section.
    * tweak.grapheme-shaping option to foot.ini to support                  
      grapheme cluster segmentation and grapheme shaping.
      The grapheme cluster width is limited to two cells by default,
      which may cause cursor synchronization issues with many applications.
    * tweak.grapheme-width-method=wcswidth option to stop limiting
      grapheme cluster width to two cells.
    * tweak.pua-double-width option to foot.ini to force                    
      Private Usage Area codepoints to be treated as double-width characters.
