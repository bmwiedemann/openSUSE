- Update to 1.9.0:
  * foot.ini options:
    * include directives for including files now expand ~ in the path.
    * New uri.uri-characters option to customize what characters are considered
      to be part of a URL.
  * If using a compositor with client-side decorations, the CSDs now show
    window titles.
  * foot's terminfo file is now installed under /usr/share/foot/terminfo
    so as to not conflict with terminfo-base's version of the file
    under /usr/share/terminfo. foot also sets the TERMINFO env var on
    the program to /usr/share/foot/terminfo so that the program prefers to
    use the file in this directory instead of terminfo-base's version.
    This is because terminfo-base's version does not expose all the capabilities
    that foot supports.
  * See https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot/releases/tag/1.9.0 for more details.

  * New foot.ini options:
    * locked-title option to disable dynamic changes to the window title.
    * tweak.overflowing-glyps option to fix rendering issues with glyphs of

      the tweak.allow-overflowing-double-width-glyphs and
      tweak.pua-double-width options, which have been removed.
  * See https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot/releases/tag/1.8.2 for more details.

- Update to 1.8.1:
  * New foot.ini options:
    * cursor.beam-thickness
    * cursor.style=beam (cursor.style=bar remains a recognized value, but will
      will eventually be deprecated, and removed)
    * cursor.underline-thickness
    * underline-offset

    * dedicated [bell] section, supporting multiple actions,      
      a new command action to run an arbitrary command and                        
      XDG activation support. The bell option has been deprecated.

      url-launch options have been deprecated in favor of options in
      this new section.
    * tweak.grapheme-shaping option to foot.ini to support                  
      grapheme cluster segmentation and grapheme shaping.

      which may cause cursor synchronization issues with many applications.
    * tweak.grapheme-width-method=wcswidth option to stop limiting
      grapheme cluster width to two cells.
    * tweak.pua-double-width option to foot.ini to force                    
      Private Usage Area codepoints to be treated as double-width characters.
  * Added support for including files in foot.ini
  * Added support for setting the full 256 color palette in foot.ini
  * Added ctrl+c as a default key binding; to cancel search/url mode.
