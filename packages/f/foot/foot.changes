- Update to v1.12.0:
  * foot.ini options:
    * Added key-bindings.scrollback-home and .scrollback-end options.
    * Added key-binding.show-urls-persistent option. This is similar to

    its environment from its parent process instead of the foot server.
  * Implemented support for more terminal sequences.
  * See https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot/releases/tag/1.12.0 for more details.
- Set all options and features explicitly instead of relying on auto-detection
  to ensure build fails if dependencies change.
- Upstream moved default foot.ini from $datadit/foot/foot.ini
  to $sysconfdir/xdg/foot/foot.ini . Move it ourselves
  to $distconfdir/xdg/foot/foot.ini in accordance with packaging guidelines
  for new packages.
- Patches:
  * Drop foot-tests-missing-deps.patch

Sat Feb  5 23:01:59 UTC 2022 - Arnav Singh <opensuse@arnavion.dev>

- Update to 1.11.0:
  * foot.ini options:
    * Added mouse-bindings.selection-override-modifiers option to specify
      which modifiers should be held to force selection and prevent
      client applications from grabbing the mouse.
    * scrollback.multiplier is now also applied in alternate-scroll mode.
      The client receives multiple arrow key presses equal to
      the multiplier instead of just one.
    * key-bindings.clipboard-{copy,paste} now support
      the XF86{Copy,Paste} keycodes.
  * irc:// and ircs:// URLs are now auto-detected as URLs.
  * Added support for reporting mouse coordinates in SGR-Pixels (1016) format.
  * Added XTGETTCAP support for reporting the current terminfo to clients
    that support it instead of needing the terminfo file installed,
    say when ssh'ing to remote hosts.
  * Added partial DECRQSS support so that clients can request
    top and bottom margins (DECSTBM), graphic rendition (SGR) and
    cursor style (DECSCUSR).
  * Searching the scrollback now defaults to searching for
    the previously-searched string.
  * PaperColorDark and PaperColorLight themes have been renamed to
    paper-color-dark and paper-color-light for consistency with other themes.
  * foot will now try to change the locale to either C.UTF-8 or en_US.UTF-8
    on startup if it has been started with a non-UTF-8 locale. If it fails to
    change the locale for any reason, it will show an error and not start
    the shell / program it was supposed to.
  * Pasting or dropping files on the alternate screen no longer quotes
    the filename.
  * Copying a line-based selection now includes a trailing newline.
  * See https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot/releases/tag/1.11.0 for more details.

  * Add foot-tests-missing-deps.patch to add missing wayland-client dependency
    to tests subdirectory, as discussed with upstream.

    * tweak.grapheme-width-method can now be set to max, which means to use
      the width of the largest codepoint in the grapheme cluster.
  * Added initial support for Kitty keyboard protocol, currently with support
    for only the "Disambiguate escape codes" mode. See Kitty keyboard protocol
    docs for more details.
  * Right-clicking the CSD title bar now informs the Wayland compositor to show
    a window context menu, if the compositor supports such a thing in general.

- Update to 1.10.0:
  * foot.ini options:
    * Added notify-focus-inhibit boolean option to control whether
      desktop notifications should be inhibited when the terminal
      has keyboard focus.

      and background colors for the scrollback indicator.
    * Added csd.border-width and csd.border-color to configure the width and
      color of the CSD border.
    * Added colors.dim0-7 options to configure custom "dim" colors.
    * Changed tweak.grapheme-shaping to be enabled by default.
    * Changed tweak.grapheme-width-method to be "wcswidth" by default.
    * All boolean options are now limited to "yes|true|on|1|no|false|off|0".
      Previously any numbers greater than 0 were treated as true, and anything
      else that wasn't "yes|true|on" was treated as false.
    * scrollback.multiplier is no longer applied when the alternate screen
      is in use.
    * Removed deprecated bell option. bell section (introduced in 1.8.0) should
      be used instead.

      osc8-underline-options options. url section (introduced in 1.8.0) should
      be used instead.
  * Some pre-defined color themes are now available in /usr/share/foot/themes/
  * See https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot/releases/tag/1.10.0 for more details.

Thu Oct 14 21:01:16 UTC 2021 - Arnav Singh <opensuse@arnavion.dev>

- Fix default TERM to be "foot" and not "foot-extra" as was intended.

- Add dependency on terminfo package since that is the package that ships
  ncurses upstream's terminfo for foot, not terminfo-base.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct  4 07:02:24 UTC 2021 - Arnav Singh <opensuse@arnavion.dev>

- Update to 1.9.2:
  * foot.ini options:
    * New tweak.font-monospace-warn option to disable new warning when
      the primary font is not monospace.
    * dpi-aware=auto option now scales fonts using the monitor's DPI only when
      all monitors have a scaling factor of one.
  * foot's custom terminfos have been moved to the foot-extra-terminfo package,
    where they have been renamed to foot-extra. By default, foot no longer
    sets TERMINFO and expects to use the terminfo shipped by ncurses. If you
    want to use the customer terminfos instead, install
    the foot-extra-terminfo package and set term=foot-extra in
    your foot config.
  * See https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot/releases/tag/1.9.1 and
    https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot/releases/tag/1.9.2 for more details.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug 27 22:17:48 UTC 2021 - Arnav Singh <opensuse@arnavion.dev>

- Update to 1.9.0:
  * foot.ini options:
    * include directives for including files now expand ~ in the path.
    * New uri.uri-characters option to customize what characters are considered
      to be part of a URL.
  * If using a compositor with client-side decorations, the CSDs now show
    window titles.
  * foot's terminfo file is now installed under /usr/share/foot/terminfo
    so as to not conflict with terminfo-base's version of the file
    under /usr/share/terminfo. foot also sets the TERMINFO env var on
    the program to /usr/share/foot/terminfo so that the program prefers to
    use the file in this directory instead of terminfo-base's version.
    This is because terminfo-base's version does not expose all the capabilities
    that foot supports.
  * See https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot/releases/tag/1.9.0 for more details.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jul 18 16:56:41 UTC 2021 - Arnav Singh <opensuse@arnavion.dev>

- Update to 1.8.2:
  * New foot.ini options:
    * locked-title option to disable dynamic changes to the window title.
    * tweak.overflowing-glyps option to fix rendering issues with glyphs of
      any width that appear cut-off. This supersedes
      the tweak.allow-overflowing-double-width-glyphs and
      tweak.pua-double-width options, which have been removed.
  * See https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot/releases/tag/1.8.2 for more details.

    * cursor.underline-thickness
    * underline-offset
    * csd.button-color
    * dedicated [bell] section, supporting multiple actions,      
      a new command action to run an arbitrary command and                        
      XDG activation support. The bell option has been deprecated.
    * dedicated [url] section. The jump-label-letters, osc8-underline and
      url-launch options have been deprecated in favor of options in
      this new section.
    * tweak.grapheme-shaping option to foot.ini to support                  
      grapheme cluster segmentation and grapheme shaping.
      The grapheme cluster width is limited to two cells by default,
      which may cause cursor synchronization issues with many applications.
    * tweak.grapheme-width-method=wcswidth option to stop limiting
      grapheme cluster width to two cells.
    * tweak.pua-double-width option to foot.ini to force                    
      Private Usage Area codepoints to be treated as double-width characters.
