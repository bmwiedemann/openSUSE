Sat Jan 18 10:10:43 UTC 2025 - Arnav Singh <opensuse@arnavion.dev>

- Update to v1.20.2:
  * foot.ini options:
    * colors.flash-alpha can be set to 1.0 (fully opaque) again.
      The issue where this would cause window to be stuck in flash state
      has been fixed separately.
  * "Report window title" (CSI 21 t) and "Report app-id" (OSC 176 ?)
    are now ignored. This relates to CVEs reported in some other terminals
    where a malicious program / ssh remote can trick the user into running
    arbitrary commands by using these sequences to fill
    the shell input buffer.
  * Fixed a crash on startup if the compositor sent a keyboard enter event
    before the window was mapped.
  * See https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot/releases/tag/1.20.2 for more details.

  * Fixed various crashes.
  * See https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot/releases/tag/1.20.0 for more details.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

      resized (and the grid reflowed) or not when zooming in/out.
    * Added main.strikeout-thickness option.
    * Added colors.sixelNN options to control the default sixel color palette.
    * Changed cursor.unfocused-style option to be effective when
      cursor.style is not "block".
  * Activating a notification that was triggered by OSC-777 or BEL now focuses
    the foot window, if XDG activation tokens are supported by
    the Wayland compositor, the notification daemon and the notification helper
    set in foot's desktop-notifications.command config.
  * The .desktop files have been renamed to remove
    the "org.codeberg.dnkl." prefix.
  * Fixed crash when setting the window title to invalid UTF-8.
  * Fixed misbehavior when the scrollback.lines config was set to a value
    that caused integer overflow.
  * Fixed some visual glitches when running under compositors that forced foot
    to double-buffer (KWin, those based on Smithay, etc).
  * See https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot/releases/tag/1.19.0 for more details.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug 14 16:27:10 UTC 2024 - Arnav Singh <opensuse@arnavion.dev>

  * Desktop notifications via OSC-99 sequence can now choose to play
    a particular sound or mute the sound.

Fri Aug  2 15:42:37 UTC 2024 - Arnav Singh <opensuse@arnavion.dev>

- Update to v1.18.0:
  * foot.ini options:
    * Added cursor.blink-rate option to configure the rate the cursor
      blinks with.
    * Deprecated main.notify and main.notify-focus-when-inhibit options
      and added new desktop-notifications option group.
      desktop-notifications.command option replaces main.notify option,
      and also takes some new templated parameters.
      desktop-notifications.inhibit-when-focused option replaces
      main.notify-focus-inhibit option.
  * Changed scrollback to respect high-resolution mousewheel scroll events
    on compositors that send them. scrollback.multiplier config option
    may need to be adjusted for users of mice that emit such events.
  * Mouse wheel events now generate BTN_WHEEL_BACK and BTN_WHEEL_FORWARD
    instead of BTN_BACK and BTN_FORWARD. The defaults of
    mouse-bindings.scrollback-up-mouse, .scrollback-down-mouse,
    .font-increase and .font-decrease have been updated accordingly.
    This means dedicated mouse buttons that do generate BTN_BACK and
    BTN_FORWARD can now be bound independently from the scroll wheel.

    ala Kitty, double underlines, color palette stack,
    in-band resize notifications to applications and

  * Unicode input mode now accepts input from the numpad as well,
    numlock is ignored.
  * Various changes related to ANSI escape sequences, foot-extra terminfo,
    Kitty keyboard protocol implementation, and sixels.

    does not incorporate the WAYLAND_DISPLAY value. The list of socket paths
    that footclient tries to connect to has been updated accordingly.
  * Fixed various bugs related to fractional scaling, font sizes, and more.
  * See https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot/releases/tag/1.15.1 for more details.

    the fractional-scale-v1 Wayland protocol. This also changes how fonts
    are scaled to be based on the output scale factor configured in
    the compositor rather than the output's DPI. To restore
    the original behavior, set main.dpi-aware to "yes".
  * Implemented support server side cursor shapes on compositors that implement
    the cursor-shape-v1 Wayland protocol.
  * Implemented support for touchscreen input.
  * Implemented XTQMODKEYS query (CSI ? Pp m).

    the compositor doesn't support the button's feature. For example,
    the minimize button won't be shown if the compositor doesn't support
    minimizing.

Sat Feb  5 23:01:59 UTC 2022 - Arnav Singh <opensuse@arnavion.dev>

- Update to 1.11.0:
  * foot.ini options:
    * Added mouse-bindings.selection-override-modifiers option to specify
      which modifiers should be held to force selection and prevent
      client applications from grabbing the mouse.
    * scrollback.multiplier is now also applied in alternate-scroll mode.

      the XF86{Copy,Paste} keycodes.
  * irc:// and ircs:// URLs are now auto-detected as URLs.
  * Added support for reporting mouse coordinates in SGR-Pixels (1016) format.
  * Added XTGETTCAP support for reporting the current terminfo to clients
    that support it instead of needing the terminfo file installed,
    say when ssh'ing to remote hosts.
  * Added partial DECRQSS support so that clients can request
    top and bottom margins (DECSTBM), graphic rendition (SGR) and
    cursor style (DECSCUSR).
  * Searching the scrollback now defaults to searching for
    the previously-searched string.
  * PaperColorDark and PaperColorLight themes have been renamed to
    paper-color-dark and paper-color-light for consistency with other themes.
  * foot will now try to change the locale to either C.UTF-8 or en_US.UTF-8
    on startup if it has been started with a non-UTF-8 locale. If it fails to
    change the locale for any reason, it will show an error and not start
    the shell / program it was supposed to.
  * Pasting or dropping files on the alternate screen no longer quotes
    the filename.
  * Copying a line-based selection now includes a trailing newline.
  * See https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot/releases/tag/1.11.0 for more details.

- Update to 1.10.0:
  * foot.ini options:
    * Added notify-focus-inhibit boolean option to control whether
      desktop notifications should be inhibited when the terminal
      has keyboard focus.
    * Added colors.scrollback-indicator color-pair option to specify foreground
      and background colors for the scrollback indicator.
    * Added csd.border-width and csd.border-color to configure the width and
      color of the CSD border.
    * Added colors.dim0-7 options to configure custom "dim" colors.
    * Changed tweak.grapheme-shaping to be enabled by default.
    * Changed tweak.grapheme-width-method to be "wcswidth" by default.
    * All boolean options are now limited to "yes|true|on|1|no|false|off|0".
      Previously any numbers greater than 0 were treated as true, and anything
      else that wasn't "yes|true|on" was treated as false.
    * scrollback.multiplier is no longer applied when the alternate screen
      is in use.
    * Removed deprecated bell option. bell section (introduced in 1.8.0) should
      be used instead.
    * Removed deprecated url-launch, jump-label-letters and
      osc8-underline-options options. url section (introduced in 1.8.0) should
      be used instead.

Thu Oct 14 21:01:16 UTC 2021 - Arnav Singh <opensuse@arnavion.dev>

- Fix default TERM to be "foot" and not "foot-extra" as was intended.

- Add dependency on terminfo package since that is the package that ships
  ncurses upstream's terminfo for foot, not terminfo-base.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct  4 07:02:24 UTC 2021 - Arnav Singh <opensuse@arnavion.dev>

- Update to 1.9.2:
  * foot.ini options:
    * New tweak.font-monospace-warn option to disable new warning when
      the primary font is not monospace.
    * dpi-aware=auto option now scales fonts using the monitor's DPI only when
      all monitors have a scaling factor of one.
  * foot's custom terminfos have been moved to the foot-extra-terminfo package,
    where they have been renamed to foot-extra. By default, foot no longer
    sets TERMINFO and expects to use the terminfo shipped by ncurses. If you
    want to use the customer terminfos instead, install
    the foot-extra-terminfo package and set term=foot-extra in
    your foot config.
  * See https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot/releases/tag/1.9.1 and
    https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot/releases/tag/1.9.2 for more details.

Fri Aug 27 22:17:48 UTC 2021 - Arnav Singh <opensuse@arnavion.dev>

- Update to 1.9.0:
  * foot.ini options:
    * include directives for including files now expand ~ in the path.
    * New uri.uri-characters option to customize what characters are considered
      to be part of a URL.
  * If using a compositor with client-side decorations, the CSDs now show
    window titles.
  * foot's terminfo file is now installed under /usr/share/foot/terminfo
    so as to not conflict with terminfo-base's version of the file
    under /usr/share/terminfo. foot also sets the TERMINFO env var on
    the program to /usr/share/foot/terminfo so that the program prefers to
    use the file in this directory instead of terminfo-base's version.
    This is because terminfo-base's version does not expose all the capabilities
    that foot supports.
  * See https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot/releases/tag/1.9.0 for more details.

Sun Jul 18 16:56:41 UTC 2021 - Arnav Singh <opensuse@arnavion.dev>

- Update to 1.8.2:
  * New foot.ini options:
    * locked-title option to disable dynamic changes to the window title.
    * tweak.overflowing-glyps option to fix rendering issues with glyphs of
      any width that appear cut-off. This supersedes
      the tweak.allow-overflowing-double-width-glyphs and
      tweak.pua-double-width options, which have been removed.
  * See https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot/releases/tag/1.8.2 for more details.

      will eventually be deprecated, and removed)

      a new command action to run an arbitrary command and                        
      XDG activation support. The bell option has been deprecated.

      url-launch options have been deprecated in favor of options in

      grapheme cluster width to two cells.
