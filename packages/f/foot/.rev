    <comment>- Update to 1.8.2:
  * New foot.ini options:
    * locked-title option to disable dynamic changes to the window title.
    * tweak.overflowing-glyps option to fix rendering issues with glyphs of
      any width that appear cut-off. This supersedes
      the tweak.allow-overflowing-double-width-glyphs and
      tweak.pua-double-width options, which have been removed.
  * See https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot/releases/tag/1.8.2 for more details.</comment>

    <comment>- Update to 1.9.0:
  * foot.ini options:
    * include directives for including files now expand ~ in the path.
    * New uri.uri-characters option to customize what characters are considered
      to be part of a URL.
  * If using a compositor with client-side decorations, the CSDs now show
    window titles.
  * foot upstream made a change to install its terminfos in a custom directory
    /usr/share/foot/terminfo and point ncurses-using applications to this by
    automatically setting the TERMINFO env var to this directory.
    However upstream is planning to revert this change in the next release
    since it doesn't work for many distros (including OpenSUSE) that configure
    ncurses with --disable-root-environ and thus prevent root programs from
    reading the env var.

    foot upstream is planning to rename its custom terminfos instead.
    It has not yet chosen a new name. For now, to unblock users who installed
    foot and want a resolution to it conflicting with the terminfo-base package,
    this OpenSUSE package has chosen &quot;foot-suse&quot;. It will be renamed
    in the future when foot upstream picks a new name.
  * See https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot/releases/tag/1.9.0 for more details.</comment>

    <comment>- Update to 1.9.2:
  * foot.ini options:
    * New tweak.font-monospace-warn option to disable new warning when
      the primary font is not monospace.
    * dpi-aware=auto option now scales fonts using the monitor's DPI only when
      all monitors have a scaling factor of one.
  * foot's custom terminfos have been moved to the foot-extra-terminfo package,
    where they have been renamed to foot-extra. By default, foot no longer
    sets TERMINFO and expects to use the terminfo shipped by ncurses. If you
    want to use the customer terminfos instead, install
    the foot-extra-terminfo package and set term=foot-extra in
    your foot config.
  * See https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot/releases/tag/1.9.1 and
    https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot/releases/tag/1.9.2 for more details.</comment>
