    <comment>- Update to 1.8.2:
  * New foot.ini options:
    * locked-title option to disable dynamic changes to the window title.
    * tweak.overflowing-glyps option to fix rendering issues with glyphs of
      any width that appear cut-off. This supersedes
      the tweak.allow-overflowing-double-width-glyphs and
      tweak.pua-double-width options, which have been removed.
  * See https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot/releases/tag/1.8.2 for more details.</comment>

    <comment>- Update to 1.9.0:
  * foot.ini options:
    * include directives for including files now expand ~ in the path.
    * New uri.uri-characters option to customize what characters are considered
      to be part of a URL.
  * If using a compositor with client-side decorations, the CSDs now show
    window titles.
  * foot upstream made a change to install its terminfos in a custom directory
    /usr/share/foot/terminfo and point ncurses-using applications to this by
    automatically setting the TERMINFO env var to this directory.
    However upstream is planning to revert this change in the next release
    since it doesn't work for many distros (including OpenSUSE) that configure
    ncurses with --disable-root-environ and thus prevent root programs from
    reading the env var.

    foot upstream is planning to rename its custom terminfos instead.
    It has not yet chosen a new name. For now, to unblock users who installed
    foot and want a resolution to it conflicting with the terminfo-base package,
    this OpenSUSE package has chosen &quot;foot-suse&quot;. It will be renamed
    in the future when foot upstream picks a new name.
  * See https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot/releases/tag/1.9.0 for more details.</comment>

    <comment>- Update to 1.9.2:
  * foot.ini options:
    * New tweak.font-monospace-warn option to disable new warning when
      the primary font is not monospace.
    * dpi-aware=auto option now scales fonts using the monitor's DPI only when
      all monitors have a scaling factor of one.
  * foot's custom terminfos have been moved to the foot-extra-terminfo package,
    where they have been renamed to foot-extra. By default, foot no longer
    sets TERMINFO and expects to use the terminfo shipped by ncurses. If you
    want to use the customer terminfos instead, install
    the foot-extra-terminfo package and set term=foot-extra in
    your foot config.

    <comment>- Fix default TERM to be &quot;foot&quot; and not &quot;foot-extra&quot; as was intended.
- Add dependency on terminfo package since that is the package that ships
  ncurses upstream's terminfo for foot, not terminfo-base.</comment>

    <comment>- Update to 1.10.0:
  * foot.ini options:
    * Added notify-focus-inhibit boolean option to control whether
      desktop notifications should be inhibited when the terminal
      has keyboard focus.

      and background colors for the scrollback indicator.
    * Added csd.border-width and csd.border-color to configure the width and
      color of the CSD border.

    * Changed tweak.grapheme-width-method to be &quot;wcswidth&quot; by default.
    * All boolean options are now limited to &quot;yes|true|on|1|no|false|off|0&quot;.
      Previously any numbers greater than 0 were treated as true, and anything
      else that wasn't &quot;yes|true|on&quot; was treated as false.
    * scrollback.multiplier is no longer applied when the alternate screen
      is in use.
    * Removed deprecated bell option. bell section (introduced in 1.8.0) should
      be used instead.
    * Removed deprecated url-launch, jump-label-letters and
      osc8-underline-options options. url section (introduced in 1.8.0) should
      be used instead.
  * Some pre-defined color themes are now available in /usr/share/foot/themes/

    <comment>- Update to 1.10.2:
  * foot.ini options:
    * tweak.grapheme-width-method can now be set to max, which means to use
      the width of the largest codepoint in the grapheme cluster.
  * Added initial support for Kitty keyboard protocol, currently with support
    for only the &quot;Disambiguate escape codes&quot; mode. See Kitty keyboard protocol
    docs for more details.
  * Right-clicking the CSD title bar now informs the Wayland compositor to show
    a window context menu, if the compositor supports such a thing in general.
