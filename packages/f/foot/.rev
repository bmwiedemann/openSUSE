    <comment>- Update to 1.8.2:
  * New foot.ini options:
    * locked-title option to disable dynamic changes to the window title.
    * tweak.overflowing-glyps option to fix rendering issues with glyphs of
      any width that appear cut-off. This supersedes
      the tweak.allow-overflowing-double-width-glyphs and
      tweak.pua-double-width options, which have been removed.

    <comment>- Update to 1.9.0:
  * foot.ini options:
    * include directives for including files now expand ~ in the path.
    * New uri.uri-characters option to customize what characters are considered
      to be part of a URL.
  * If using a compositor with client-side decorations, the CSDs now show
    window titles.
  * foot upstream made a change to install its terminfos in a custom directory
    /usr/share/foot/terminfo and point ncurses-using applications to this by
    automatically setting the TERMINFO env var to this directory.
    However upstream is planning to revert this change in the next release
    since it doesn't work for many distros (including OpenSUSE) that configure
    ncurses with --disable-root-environ and thus prevent root programs from
    reading the env var.

    foot upstream is planning to rename its custom terminfos instead.
    It has not yet chosen a new name. For now, to unblock users who installed
    foot and want a resolution to it conflicting with the terminfo-base package,
    this OpenSUSE package has chosen &quot;foot-suse&quot;. It will be renamed
    in the future when foot upstream picks a new name.
  * See https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot/releases/tag/1.9.0 for more details.</comment>

    <comment>- Update to 1.9.2:
  * foot.ini options:
    * New tweak.font-monospace-warn option to disable new warning when
      the primary font is not monospace.
    * dpi-aware=auto option now scales fonts using the monitor's DPI only when
      all monitors have a scaling factor of one.
  * foot's custom terminfos have been moved to the foot-extra-terminfo package,
    where they have been renamed to foot-extra. By default, foot no longer
    sets TERMINFO and expects to use the terminfo shipped by ncurses. If you
    want to use the customer terminfos instead, install
    the foot-extra-terminfo package and set term=foot-extra in
    your foot config.

    <user>dimstar_suse</user>
    <comment>- Update to 1.10.0:
  * foot.ini options:
    * Added notify-focus-inhibit boolean option to control whether
      desktop notifications should be inhibited when the terminal
      has keyboard focus.
    * Added colors.scrollback-indicator color-pair option to specify foreground
      and background colors for the scrollback indicator.
    * Added csd.border-width and csd.border-color to configure the width and
      color of the CSD border.

    * Changed tweak.grapheme-shaping to be enabled by default.
    * Changed tweak.grapheme-width-method to be &quot;wcswidth&quot; by default.
    * All boolean options are now limited to &quot;yes|true|on|1|no|false|off|0&quot;.
      Previously any numbers greater than 0 were treated as true, and anything
      else that wasn't &quot;yes|true|on&quot; was treated as false.
    * scrollback.multiplier is no longer applied when the alternate screen
      is in use.
    * Removed deprecated bell option. bell section (introduced in 1.8.0) should
      be used instead.
    * Removed deprecated url-launch, jump-label-letters and
      osc8-underline-options options. url section (introduced in 1.8.0) should
      be used instead.
  * Some pre-defined color themes are now available in /usr/share/foot/themes/

    that were introduced in 1.10.0.
  * Added XDG desktop file for footclient.
  * See https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot/releases/tag/1.10.1 for more details.

  * foot.ini options:
    * tweak.grapheme-width-method can now be set to max, which means to use
      the width of the largest codepoint in the grapheme cluster.
  * Added initial support for Kitty keyboard protocol, currently with support
    for only the &quot;Disambiguate escape codes&quot; mode. See Kitty keyboard protocol
    docs for more details.
  * Right-clicking the CSD title bar now informs the Wayland compositor to show
    a window context menu, if the compositor supports such a thing in general.

    <user>dimstar_suse</user>
    <comment>- Update to 1.11.0:
  * foot.ini options:
    * Added mouse-bindings.selection-override-modifiers option to specify
      which modifiers should be held to force selection and prevent
      client applications from grabbing the mouse.
    * scrollback.multiplier is now also applied in alternate-scroll mode.
      The client receives multiple arrow key presses equal to
      the multiplier instead of just one.
    * key-bindings.clipboard-{copy,paste} now support
      the XF86{Copy,Paste} keycodes.
  * irc:// and ircs:// URLs are now auto-detected as URLs.
  * Added support for reporting mouse coordinates in SGR-Pixels (1016) format.
  * Added XTGETTCAP support for reporting the current terminfo to clients
    that support it instead of needing the terminfo file installed,
    say when ssh'ing to remote hosts.
  * Added partial DECRQSS support so that clients can request
    top and bottom margins (DECSTBM), graphic rendition (SGR) and
    cursor style (DECSCUSR).
  * Searching the scrollback now defaults to searching for
    the previously-searched string.
  * PaperColorDark and PaperColorLight themes have been renamed to
    paper-color-dark and paper-color-light for consistency with other themes.
  * foot will now try to change the locale to either C.UTF-8 or en_US.UTF-8
    on startup if it has been started with a non-UTF-8 locale. If it fails to
    change the locale for any reason, it will show an error and not start
    the shell / program it was supposed to.
  * Pasting or dropping files on the alternate screen no longer quotes
    the filename.
  * Copying a line-based selection now includes a trailing newline.
  * See https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot/releases/tag/1.11.0 for more details.
- Patches:
  * Add foot-tests-missing-deps.patch to add missing wayland-client dependency
    to tests subdirectory, as discussed with upstream.</comment>

    <user>dimstar_suse</user>
    <comment>- Update to v1.12.0:
  * foot.ini options:
    * Added key-bindings.scrollback-home and .scrollback-end options.
    * Added key-binding.show-urls-persistent option. This is similar to
      show-urls-launch, but remains in URL mode after activating an URL.
    * Added tweak.sixel option to allow disabling sixel support.
    * Added csd.hide-when-maximized option to hide the CSD when maximized.
  * Implemented socket activation support for foot --server, along with
    sample systemd user session units.
  * footclient now has a -E,--client-environment parameter to inherit
    its environment from its parent process instead of the foot server.
  * Implemented support for more terminal sequences.
  * See https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot/releases/tag/1.12.0 for more details.
- Set all options and features explicitly instead of relying on auto-detection
  to ensure build fails if dependencies change.
- Upstream moved default foot.ini from $datadit/foot/foot.ini
  to $sysconfdir/xdg/foot/foot.ini . Move it ourselves
  to $distconfdir/xdg/foot/foot.ini in accordance with packaging guidelines
  for new packages.
- Patches:
  * Drop foot-tests-missing-deps.patch</comment>

    <comment>- Update to v1.13.0:
  * foot.ini options:
    * Added colors.search-box-no-match and colors.search-box-match options.
    * Added new environment section to define custom environment variables for
      child processes.
    * Added key-bindings.prompt-prev and key-bindings.prompt-next options.
      These key bindings jump to the previous / next prompt with a cooperating
      shell.
    * Added key-bindings.unicode-input and search-bindings.unicode-input
      options. They provide a way to input unicode using codepoints without
      an external IME.
  * Client-side decorations no longer show buttons that do nothing because
    the compositor doesn't support the button's feature. For example,
    the minimize button won't be shown if the compositor doesn't support
    minimizing.
  * Added new themes - Monokai Pro, Catppuccin, Tokyo Night,
    Tokyo Night Day, Tokyo Night Storm.
  * See https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot/releases/tag/1.13.0 for more details.
- Mark foot-extra-terminfo and foot-themes packages as noarch.
- Remove redundant copy of doc files and license in $datadir/doc/foot/</comment>

    * Added underline-thickness option to set underline height.
    * Changed default colors to correspond to the solarized-dark-normal-brights
      theme.
    * Added main.utempter option to set path to utempter binary, used to
      create utmp records. Defaults to the path of that binary at build time.
    * Changed default grapheme-width-method option to double-width.
    * Changed default pad option to 0x0.
    * String values can now be quoted with double quotes (&quot;&quot;), which can be
      used to set an option to an empty string value. For environment variables
      setting them to the empty string unsets them.
  * Added various terminfo capabilities to work better with vim, etc.
  * Fixed various crashes.
  * Added new themes - deus, material-amber, modus, moonfly, nightfly, onedark,
    rose-pine, zenburn.

    * Added touch.long-press-delay option.
    * Renamed main.utempter option to main.utmp-helper. main.utempter is still
      recognized, but will log a deprecation warning.
    * Changed default main.dpi-aware value from &quot;auto&quot; to &quot;no&quot;, and &quot;auto&quot; is
      no longer an allowed value.
    * Default theme is now &quot;starlight&quot;.
    * Changed default key-bindings.show-urls-launch from Ctrl-Shift-U to
      Ctrl-Shift-O.
    * Changed default key-bindings.unicode-input from none to Ctrl-Shift-U.
  * Implemented support fractional scaling on compositors that implement
    the fractional-scale-v1 Wayland protocol. This also changes how fonts
    are scaled to be based on the output scale factor configured in
    the compositor rather than the output's DPI. To restore
    the original behavior, set main.dpi-aware to &quot;yes&quot;.
  * Implemented support server side cursor shapes on compositors that implement
    the cursor-shape-v1 Wayland protocol.
  * Implemented support for touchscreen input.
  * Implemented XTQMODKEYS query (CSI ? Pp m).
  * Added new themes - aeroroot, ayu-mirage, srcery, starlight.
  * Fixed incorrect icon in dock and window switcher on GNOME.
  * Fixed various bugs in sixel output.
  * Fixed various crashes when resizing or scrolling.
  * See https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot/releases/tag/1.15.0 for more details.

  * Background transparency (alpha) is now disabled in fullscreened windows.
  * systemd service and socket units of foot-server are no longer instanced
    on the WAYLAND_DISPLAY env var. They are now singletons and part of
    the standard graphical-session.target. This also means the socket path
    does not incorporate the WAYLAND_DISPLAY value. The list of socket paths
    that footclient tries to connect to has been updated accordingly.

    is fully initialized.

    grapheme clusters.
  * Fixed margins to become non-transparent in full-screen mode, for
    compliance with the current Wayland protocol specification.

    <user>dimstar_suse</user>
    <comment>- Update to v1.18.0:
  * foot.ini options:
    * Added cursor.blink-rate option to configure the rate the cursor
      blinks with.
    * Deprecated main.notify and main.notify-focus-when-inhibit options
      and added new desktop-notifications option group.
      desktop-notifications.command option replaces main.notify option,
      and also takes some new templated parameters.
      desktop-notifications.inhibit-when-focused option replaces
      main.notify-focus-inhibit option.
  * Changed scrollback to respect high-resolution mousewheel scroll events
    on compositors that send them. scrollback.multiplier config option
    may need to be adjusted for users of mice that emit such events.
  * Mouse wheel events now generate BTN_WHEEL_BACK and BTN_WHEEL_FORWARD
    instead of BTN_BACK and BTN_FORWARD. The defaults of
    mouse-bindings.scrollback-up-mouse, .scrollback-down-mouse,
    .font-increase and .font-decrease have been updated accordingly.
    This means dedicated mouse buttons that do generate BTN_BACK and
    BTN_FORWARD can now be bound independently from the scroll wheel.
  * Added support for rendering colored and styled (wavy) underlines
    ala Kitty, double underlines, color palette stack,
    in-band resize notifications to applications and
    Kitty desktop notifications protocol.
  * Added new themes: catppuccin-frappe, catppuccin-latte,
    catppuccin-macchiato, catppuccin-mocha, nvim-dark, nvim-light.
  * Fixed various crashes, compatibility issues with terminal codes
    and other bugs.
  * See https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot/releases/tag/1.18.0 for more details.</comment>

  * foot.ini options:
    * desktop-notifications.command config can now also use &quot;${muted}&quot;
      and &quot;${sound-name}&quot; in its template value.
  * CSD buttons now activate on mouse button release, rather than press.
  * Desktop notifications via OSC-99 sequence can now choose to play
    a particular sound or mute the sound.
  * Fixed bug in OSC-111 sequence used to reset background color not handling
    alpha changes correctly, causing visual glitches.

    <comment>- Update to v1.19.0:
  * foot.ini options:
    * Added main.resize-keep-grid option to control whether the window is
      resized (and the grid reflowed) or not when zooming in/out.
    * Added main.strikeout-thickness option.
    * Added colors.sixelNN options to control the default sixel color palette.
    * Changed cursor.unfocused-style option to be effective when
      cursor.style is not &quot;block&quot;.
  * Activating a notification that was triggered by OSC-777 or BEL now focuses
    the foot window, if XDG activation tokens are supported by
    the Wayland compositor, the notification daemon and the notification helper
    set in foot's desktop-notifications.command config.
  * The .desktop files have been renamed to remove
    the &quot;org.codeberg.dnkl.&quot; prefix.
  * Fixed crash when setting the window title to invalid UTF-8.
  * Fixed misbehavior when the scrollback.lines config was set to a value
    that caused integer overflow.
  * Fixed some visual glitches when running under compositors that forced foot
    to double-buffer (KWin, those based on Smithay, etc).
  * See https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot/releases/tag/1.19.0 for more details.</comment>

    <comment>- Update to v1.20.0:

    * Added security.osc52 to partially or fully disable clipboard access
      via the OSC-52 escape sequence. Defaults to enabling clipboard access.
    * Various keybindings for search mode that were implemented previously but
      not documented have now been documented in the manpages.
  * Runtime changes to the window title and app ID now require the value
    to only contain printable characters.
  * Added new themes: rose-pine-dawn, rose-pine-moon.
  * Fixed various crashes.

    <comment>- Update to v1.20.2:
  * foot.ini options:
    * colors.flash-alpha can be set to 1.0 (fully opaque) again.
      The issue where this would cause window to be stuck in flash state
      has been fixed separately.
  * &quot;Report window title&quot; (CSI 21 t) and &quot;Report app-id&quot; (OSC 176 ?)
    are now ignored. This relates to CVEs reported in some other terminals
    where a malicious program / ssh remote can trick the user into running
    arbitrary commands by using these sequences to fill
    the shell input buffer.
  * Fixed a crash on startup if the compositor sent a keyboard enter event
    before the window was mapped.
  * See https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot/releases/tag/1.20.2 for more details.
