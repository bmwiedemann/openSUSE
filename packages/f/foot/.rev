    <comment>- Update to 1.8.2:
  * New foot.ini options:
    * locked-title option to disable dynamic changes to the window title.
    * tweak.overflowing-glyps option to fix rendering issues with glyphs of
      any width that appear cut-off. This supersedes
      the tweak.allow-overflowing-double-width-glyphs and
      tweak.pua-double-width options, which have been removed.
  * See https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot/releases/tag/1.8.2 for more details.</comment>

    <comment>- Update to 1.9.0:
  * foot.ini options:
    * include directives for including files now expand ~ in the path.
    * New uri.uri-characters option to customize what characters are considered
      to be part of a URL.
  * If using a compositor with client-side decorations, the CSDs now show
    window titles.
  * foot upstream made a change to install its terminfos in a custom directory
    /usr/share/foot/terminfo and point ncurses-using applications to this by
    automatically setting the TERMINFO env var to this directory.
    However upstream is planning to revert this change in the next release
    since it doesn't work for many distros (including OpenSUSE) that configure
    ncurses with --disable-root-environ and thus prevent root programs from
    reading the env var.

    foot upstream is planning to rename its custom terminfos instead.
    It has not yet chosen a new name. For now, to unblock users who installed
    foot and want a resolution to it conflicting with the terminfo-base package,
    this OpenSUSE package has chosen &quot;foot-suse&quot;. It will be renamed
    in the future when foot upstream picks a new name.
  * See https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot/releases/tag/1.9.0 for more details.</comment>

    <comment>- Update to 1.9.2:
  * foot.ini options:
    * New tweak.font-monospace-warn option to disable new warning when
      the primary font is not monospace.
    * dpi-aware=auto option now scales fonts using the monitor's DPI only when
      all monitors have a scaling factor of one.
  * foot's custom terminfos have been moved to the foot-extra-terminfo package,
    where they have been renamed to foot-extra. By default, foot no longer
    sets TERMINFO and expects to use the terminfo shipped by ncurses. If you
    want to use the customer terminfos instead, install
    the foot-extra-terminfo package and set term=foot-extra in
    your foot config.

    <comment>- Fix default TERM to be &quot;foot&quot; and not &quot;foot-extra&quot; as was intended.
- Add dependency on terminfo package since that is the package that ships
  ncurses upstream's terminfo for foot, not terminfo-base.</comment>

    <comment>- Update to 1.10.0:
  * foot.ini options:
    * Added notify-focus-inhibit boolean option to control whether
      desktop notifications should be inhibited when the terminal
      has keyboard focus.
    * Added colors.scrollback-indicator color-pair option to specify foreground
      and background colors for the scrollback indicator.

    * Changed tweak.grapheme-width-method to be &quot;wcswidth&quot; by default.
    * All boolean options are now limited to &quot;yes|true|on|1|no|false|off|0&quot;.

      else that wasn't &quot;yes|true|on&quot; was treated as false.
    * scrollback.multiplier is no longer applied when the alternate screen
      is in use.
    * Removed deprecated bell option. bell section (introduced in 1.8.0) should
      be used instead.
    * Removed deprecated url-launch, jump-label-letters and
      osc8-underline-options options. url section (introduced in 1.8.0) should
      be used instead.
  * Some pre-defined color themes are now available in /usr/share/foot/themes/

    that were introduced in 1.10.0.

    <comment>- Update to 1.10.2:
  * foot.ini options:
    * tweak.grapheme-width-method can now be set to max, which means to use
      the width of the largest codepoint in the grapheme cluster.
  * Added initial support for Kitty keyboard protocol, currently with support
    for only the &quot;Disambiguate escape codes&quot; mode. See Kitty keyboard protocol
    docs for more details.
  * Right-clicking the CSD title bar now informs the Wayland compositor to show
    a window context menu, if the compositor supports such a thing in general.
  * See https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot/releases/tag/1.10.2 for more details.</comment>

    <user>dimstar_suse</user>
    <comment>- Update to 1.11.0:
  * foot.ini options:
    * Added mouse-bindings.selection-override-modifiers option to specify
      which modifiers should be held to force selection and prevent
      client applications from grabbing the mouse.
    * scrollback.multiplier is now also applied in alternate-scroll mode.
      The client receives multiple arrow key presses equal to
      the multiplier instead of just one.
    * key-bindings.clipboard-{copy,paste} now support
      the XF86{Copy,Paste} keycodes.
  * irc:// and ircs:// URLs are now auto-detected as URLs.
  * Added support for reporting mouse coordinates in SGR-Pixels (1016) format.
  * Added XTGETTCAP support for reporting the current terminfo to clients
    that support it instead of needing the terminfo file installed,
    say when ssh'ing to remote hosts.
  * Added partial DECRQSS support so that clients can request
    top and bottom margins (DECSTBM), graphic rendition (SGR) and
    cursor style (DECSCUSR).
  * Searching the scrollback now defaults to searching for
    the previously-searched string.
  * PaperColorDark and PaperColorLight themes have been renamed to
    paper-color-dark and paper-color-light for consistency with other themes.
  * foot will now try to change the locale to either C.UTF-8 or en_US.UTF-8
    on startup if it has been started with a non-UTF-8 locale. If it fails to
    change the locale for any reason, it will show an error and not start
    the shell / program it was supposed to.
  * Pasting or dropping files on the alternate screen no longer quotes
    the filename.
  * Copying a line-based selection now includes a trailing newline.
  * See https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot/releases/tag/1.11.0 for more details.
- Patches:
  * Add foot-tests-missing-deps.patch to add missing wayland-client dependency
    to tests subdirectory, as discussed with upstream.</comment>

    <user>dimstar_suse</user>
    <comment>- Update to v1.12.0:
  * foot.ini options:
    * Added key-bindings.scrollback-home and .scrollback-end options.
    * Added key-binding.show-urls-persistent option. This is similar to
      show-urls-launch, but remains in URL mode after activating an URL.
    * Added tweak.sixel option to allow disabling sixel support.
    * Added csd.hide-when-maximized option to hide the CSD when maximized.
  * Implemented socket activation support for foot --server, along with
    sample systemd user session units.
  * footclient now has a -E,--client-environment parameter to inherit
    its environment from its parent process instead of the foot server.
  * Implemented support for more terminal sequences.
  * See https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot/releases/tag/1.12.0 for more details.
- Set all options and features explicitly instead of relying on auto-detection
  to ensure build fails if dependencies change.
- Upstream moved default foot.ini from $datadit/foot/foot.ini
  to $sysconfdir/xdg/foot/foot.ini . Move it ourselves
  to $distconfdir/xdg/foot/foot.ini in accordance with packaging guidelines
  for new packages.
- Patches:
  * Drop foot-tests-missing-deps.patch</comment>

    <comment>- Update to v1.13.0:
  * foot.ini options:
    * Added colors.search-box-no-match and colors.search-box-match options.
    * Added new environment section to define custom environment variables for
      child processes.
    * Added key-bindings.prompt-prev and key-bindings.prompt-next options.
      These key bindings jump to the previous / next prompt with a cooperating
      shell.
    * Added key-bindings.unicode-input and search-bindings.unicode-input
      options. They provide a way to input unicode using codepoints without
      an external IME.
  * Client-side decorations no longer show buttons that do nothing because
    the compositor doesn't support the button's feature. For example,
    the minimize button won't be shown if the compositor doesn't support
    minimizing.
  * Added new themes - Monokai Pro, Catppuccin, Tokyo Night,
    Tokyo Night Day, Tokyo Night Storm.
  * See https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot/releases/tag/1.13.0 for more details.
- Mark foot-extra-terminfo and foot-themes packages as noarch.
- Remove redundant copy of doc files and license in $datadir/doc/foot/</comment>
