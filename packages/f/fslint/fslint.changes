- update to 2.46
  * Fixes:
    * Selecting within and removal of GUI groups works again.
      This regression was introduced in 2.44.
    * "Bad symlinks" functionality works in the GUI again.
      This regression was introduced in 2.44.
    * Dangling symlinks are reported correctly for symlinks
      whose names end in 2 digits.
    * Empty directories now only lists actual empty dirs
      even if extra find parameters are specified.
    * Empty directories now ignore specified exluded paths, as
      they can impact whether an "empty" directory can be removed.
    * Single quotes in extra find params are now quoted,
      and no longer generate a syntax error.
    * Multiple adjacent spaces in command line params are preserved
      and no longer generate file not found errors.
    * Listing packages is supported for modern archlinux systems.
  * Improvements:
    * findup now includes zero length files by default.  This can
      be changed with -size +0c, or the new GUI min size option.
    * findup no longer reports/remerges duplicates when there
      are other files being checked that are the same size.
      (The GUI already had such logic in place).
    * findup supports symlinking duplicates as well as hardlinking.
    * "Select from same folder" is now less CPU and RAM intensive.
    * A renamed duplicate file no longer auto removes another
      item in the group from display, to allow deleting it etc.

      in German locales. This regression was introduced in 2.42.
