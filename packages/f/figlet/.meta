  <title>Tool for Creating Cool ASCII-Art Signatures</title>
  <description>FIGlet can create characters in many different styles and can kern and
&quot;smush&quot; these characters together in various ways. FIGlet output is
generally reminiscent of the sort of &quot;signatures&quot; many people like to
put at the end of e-mail and UseNet messages.</description>
