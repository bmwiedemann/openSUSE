%description
Flacon extracts individual tracks from one big audio file containing the entire
album of music and saves them as separate audio files. To do this, it uses
information from the appropriate CUE file. Besides, Flacon makes it possible
to conveniently revise or specify tags both for all tracks at once or for each
tag separately.
