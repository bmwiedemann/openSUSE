- Update to 11.0.0:
  * If you try to close the program while the conversion is in progress, the program will ask for confirmation

  * Error if tracks overwrite files (taking into account the template)
  * Error if there are tracks with the same track number and creating files in the same directory. The pattern doesn't matter
  * Warning if any disks use the same CUE file
  * Warning if any disks use the same audio file
  * Fix: The program show an error when the source files are located on slow network drives
  * Fix: The program show an error on WV files larger than 2 gigabytes
  * Minor fixes

Tue Jan 24 09:45:43 UTC 2023 - Andrea Manzini <andrea.manzini@suse.com>

- Update to 10.0.0:
  * Now the program does not use external utilities to calculate ReplayGain, instead the built-in method is used. This accelerated the conversion process and reduced the number of dependencies.
  * For package maintainers: Note that metaflac, mp3gain, vorbisgain and wvgain are no longer needed.
  * Improved error handling. Before starting the conversion, you can view all errors and warnings in one window.
  * Fixed bug: When changing the “Artist” field, the “Album Artist” field mistakenly becomes “Multiple Values”
  * Translations updated

- update to 9.5.1:
  * Fixed bug: In the tag editing fields, the text cursor jumped to the end
    of the line after entering a letter.
  * Before starting the conversion, the program checks that the disks will
    not overwrite each other's output files.
  * Translations updated

- Update to version 9.4.0
  * fix to work with CUE files containing multiple audio file tags
  * Translations updated
  * The program gives a clear error message if the necessary utilities (sox, encoders, etc.) are missing
  * Improved algorithm of cover auto selection. Square pictures have a priority over other.
  * Fixed a bug with text color on tooltips in Linux. 
  * You can now get tags from MusicBrainz and Discogs.
  * Support for CUE files with gaps appended to the end of the previous track
  * Added support for ALAC output files, Sony Wave64 input files.
  * Added the ability to embed the cover in the output ALAC, AAC, MP3, Opus and WavPack files.
  * Fix: If the CUE file contains two discs, then the program incorrectly calculated the duration of the tracks.
  * The program automatically calculates the number of threads to encode. You can change this in the preferences dialog.
  * The program can split huge FLAC files (more than 4GB)
  * You can not only copy the cover image to a file, but also embed it in the output FLAC files.
  * Improved the preferences dialog. The settings are divided into separate tabs.
  * Added support for pre-emphasis CD images.

Tue Apr 27 10:37:21 UTC 2021 - Luigi Baldoni <aloisio@gmx.com>

- Update to version 7.0.1
  * Added informative error messages when the program can't load
    an audio file:
    + The audio file does not exist.
    + The audio file may be corrupted or an unsupported audio
      format.
    + Decoder program is not installed.
    + Decoder program is installed in the settings but binary
      file does not exist.
  * Improved warning messages:
    + Do not show a warning if the output format does not
      support the quality of the input HD audio, but you have
      set the correct bits per sample and sample rate in the
      preferences.
  * Redesigned the logic of loading CUE files containing
    multiple files, for example, 2 sides of an LP. Now they are
    displayed as a single list, have a single track numbering,
    and allow you to change album tags in a single operation.
  * Fixed: Flacon refuses to compute ReplayGain for no good
    reason.
  * Improved search for covers arts.
  * Added better icons for dark themes.
  * Added a few codepages for some East Asian languages.
  * Translations updated.
