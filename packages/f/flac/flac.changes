Fri Nov 25 17:52:46 UTC 2022 - Jonas Kvinge <jonaski@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 1.4.2:
  + General
    * Remove xmms plugin (Martijn van Beurden, TokyoBlackHole)
    * Remove all pure assembler, removing build dependency on nasm
    * Made console output more uniform across different platforms
      and CPUs
    * Improve ability to tune compile for a certain system (for
      example with -march=native) when combining with
      --disable-asm-optimizations: plain C functions can now be
      better optimized
  + Build system
    * Default CFLAGS are now prepended instead of dropped when user
      CFLAGS are set
    * -msse2 is no longer added by default (was only applicable
      to x86)
    * Fix cross-compiling and out-of-tree building when pandoc and
      doxygen are not available
    * Fix issue with Clang not compiling functions with intrinsics
    * Fix detection of bswap intrinsics (Ozkan Sezer)
    * Improve search for libssp on MinGW (Ozkan Sezer,
      Martijn van Beurden)
  + libFLAC
    * Fix issue when the libFLAC user seeks in a file instead of
      libFLAC itself
- Drop obsoleted flac-cflags.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- Rebase flac-cflags.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Sep 11 16:31:56 UTC 2022 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.4.0:
  + General:
    * It is now possible to limit the minimum bitrate of a FLAC
      file generated by libFLAC and with the flac tool to 1
      bit/sample. This function can be used to aid live streaming,
      for example for internet radio
    * Encoding files with sample rates up to 1'048'575Hz is now
      possible.
    * Compression of preset -3 through -8 was slightly improved at
      the cost of a small decrease in encoding speed by increasing
      the precision with which autocorrelation was calculated
    * Encoding speed of preset -0, -1 and -2 was slightly improved
    * Compression of presets -1 and -4 was slighly improved on
      certain material by changing the adaptive mid-side heuristics
    * Speedups specifically targeting 64-bit ARMv8 devices using
      NEON were integrated
    * Speedups for x86_64 CPUs having the FMA instruction set
      extention are added
    * Encoding and decoding of 32-bit PCM is now possible
  + (Ogg) FLAC format:
    * The FLAC format document is being rewritten by the IETF
      CELLAR working group. The latest draft can be found on
      https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-cellar-flac/
    * The FLAC format document specifies no bounds for the
      residual. In other to match current decoder implementations,
      it is proposed to bound the residual to the range provided by
      a 32-bit int signed two's complement. This limit must be
      checked by FLAC encoders as to keep FLAC decoders free from
      the complexity of being to decode a residual exceeding a
      32-bit int.
    * There is now a set of files available to test whether a FLAC
      decoder implements the format correctly. This FLAC decoder
      testbench can be found at
      https://github.com/ietf-wg-cellar/flac-test-files. Also,
      results of testing hard- and software can be found here at
      https://wiki.hydrogenaud.io/index.php?title=FLAC_decoder_testbench.
  + flac:
    * The option --limit-min-bitrate was added to aid streaming,
      see github #264
    * The option --keep-foreign-metadata-if-present is added. This
      option works the same as --keep-foreign-metadata, but does
      return a warning instead of an error if no foreign metadata
      was found to store or restore
    * The warning returned by the foreign metadata handling is now
      clearer in case a user tries to restore foreign metadata of
      the wrong type, for example decoding a FLAC file containing
      AIFF foreign metadata to a WAV file
    * A problem when using the analyse function causing the first
      frame to have a wrong size and offset was fixed
    * Fix bug where channel mask of a file is unintentionally
      reused when several files are processed with one command
    * The order of compression-related commands is no longer
      important, i.e. -8ep gives the same result as -ep8.
      Previously, a compression level (like -8) would override a
      more specific setting (like -e or -p). This is no longer the
      case
    * flac now checks the block-align property of WAV files to
      ensure non-standard WAV files (for which flac has no
      handling) are not mangled
  + build system:
    * MSVC and Makefile.lite build system files have been removed.
      Building with MSVC (Visual Studio) can be done by using CMake
    * Various CMake improvements, especially for creating MSVC
      build files
    * Various fixes for MinGW
    * Removed obsolete autotools macro's to silence warnings
    * Fixes for FreeBSD PowerPC
    * Fixed some compiler warnings
    * Fix building with uclibc
  + testing/validation:
    * Addition of new encoder fuzzer, adding fuzzing for 8, 24 and
      32-bit inputs
    * Addition of new decoder fuzzer, adding coverage of seeking
      code
    * Addition of metadata fuzzer, adding coverage of metadata APIs
    * Various improvements to fuzzers to improve code coverage,
      fuzzing speed and stability
    * Many changes to test suite to improve cross-platform
      compatibility
    * Windows CI now also builds the whole test suite
    * Clang-format file added
    * Add warning on using v141_xp platform toolset with /MT
  + libraries:
    * Various seeking fixes
    * Various bugs fixed found by fuzzing
    * On decoding, it is now checked whether residuals can be
      contained by a 32-bit int, preventing integer overflow
    * Add check that samples supplied to libFLAC actually fall
      within the bps set
    * Add checks when parsing metadata blocks to not allocate
      excessive amounts of memory and not overread
    * Undocumented Windows-only utf8 functions are no longer
      exported to the DLL interface
    * Removed all assembler and intrinsics code from the decoder to
      improve fuzzing, as they provided only a small speed benefit
    * The bitwriter buffer is limited in size to 2^24 bytes, so it
      cannot write excessively large files. This is a backup in
      case another bug in this area creeps (back) in.
    * The metadata iterations should now never return a
      vorbiscomment entry with NULL as an entry, now always at
      least an empty string is returned
  + documentation: Removed html documentation and generate man
    pages from markdown
  + Interface changes:
    * libFLAC:
      . Addition of FLAC__stream_encoder_set_limit_min_bitrate()
        and FLAC__stream_encoder_get_limit_min_bitrate(), see
        github #264
      . get_client_data_from_decoder is renamed
        FLAC__get_decoder_client_data(), see github #124
      . All API functions taking a filename as an argument now take
        UTF-8 filenames on Windows, and no longer accept filenames
        using the current codepage
      . FLAC__Frame struct has changed: warmup samples are now
        stored in FLAC__int64 instead of FLAC__int32 types, and
        verbatim samples can now be stored in either FLAC__int32 or
        FLAC__int64 depending on whether samples fix the former or
        latter
      . The FLAC__StreamMetadata struct now has a tag, so it can be
        forward declared
    * libFLAC++:
      . Addition of ::set_limit_min_bitrate() and
        ::get_limit_min_bitrate(), see github #264
      . All API functions taking a filename as an argument now take
        UTF-8 filenames on Windows, and no longer accept filenames
        using the current codepage
      . The ::FLAC__Frame struct has changed, see the libFLAC
        interface change.

Tue Mar 13 20:45:17 UTC 2012 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Add flac-gcc47.patch: Replacing strcpy without 'lenght
  limitation' with strncpy, limited to 4 chars. This is safe, as we
  check the length already to be sure it is 4 chars, yet do not
  suffer from the problem that strcpy wants to add a '\0' char in
  plus to the target string.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
