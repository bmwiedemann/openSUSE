        - Added URI::_ado, which subclasses URI::_odbc to provide a `dbi_dsn()`
          that returns a DSN using DBD::ADO. NOTE: This class is experimental,
          since I was unable to figure out the best default values for the
          connection string -- there are so many options! Feedback and
          recommendations wanted (Issue #11).
        - The `dbi_dsn` method of URI::mssql now supports a single argument to
          specify the DBI driver for which to return a DSN. Pass in "sybase" or
          "ado" (experimental) to get a DSN for either of those drivers,
          instead. Based on work by Dan Muey.

        - Added new abstract class, URI::_odbc, for URIs that use ODBC in
          `dbi_dsn`.
        - The `dbi_dsn` method of URI::mssql now returns an ODBC DSN instead of
          DBD::Sybase, since the latter would require Sybase to build.
        - URI::sqlserver now inherits from URI::mssql rather than the other way
          around.
        - Fixed a bug where a URI with three slashes but no authority part after
          the first two would incorrectly think the databse name should be an
          absolute path. That is, in "db:sqlite:///foo.db", the `dbname` value
          is "foo.db", not "/foo.db". Thanks to Dan Book for the report
          (issue #8).
