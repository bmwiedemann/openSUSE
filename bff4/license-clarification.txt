Hi Adam,

You can use 'public domain' or another the least restrictive license.

Subject: question about bff4

Hi.
Your brainfuck interpreter is pretty cool, and I wanted to build it on
openSuSE Build Service (http://en.opensuse.org/Build_Service). My
question is:
Under which license is source code of bff4 released?
(GPL, BSD, or maybe something else...)

It's needed to be written in package specification and I don't want to
leave it blank, or to choose by myself.
