- Update to version 1.1.10
  * Implemented 3D reverb simulator plugin series - Room Builder
    Mono and Room Builder Stereo.
  * Fixed improper InlineDisplay feature support in LV2 TTL
    files.
  * Plugin names now have 'LSP' prefix for the LV2 format.
  * Each plugin can now provide it's custom UI class which is
    derived from common plugin's UI class.
  * Code now compiles for the PPC64 architecture.
  * Code now compiles for the IBM s390x architecture.
  * Added command-line option to pass configuration file name
    for standalone JACK plugins.
  * The settings stored in configuration file will be
    automatically loaded at startup.
  * Updated function signatures for libraries which now support
    '-fvisibility=hidden' compilation flag.
  * Added support of nested menus in the UI toolkit.
  * Added 3D scene rendering support in the UI by using
    different rendering backends.
  * Implemented GLX backend based on openGL 2.x for rendering 3D
    scenes.
  * Implemented key-value tree storage (KVTStorage) for storing
    and managing dynamic parameters.
  * Implemented key-value tree storage (KVTStorage) UI<->DSP
    synchronization mechanisms.
  * Implemented key-value tree storage (KVTStorage)
    serialization/deserialization in parameters.
  * Implemented key-value tree storage (KVTStorage)
    serialization/deserialization for the plugin state.
  * Implemented mechanism for UI<->DSP OSC message interchange.
  * Added support of OSC protocol messages serialization,
    deserialization and pattern matching.
  * Optimized complex number functions for AArch64 architecture.
  * Changed installation path for jack core library from to
    /lsp-plugins.
  * Added more careful file type analysis for non-EXT file
    systems.
  * Added support of Hygon Dhyana x86 family CPU optimizations
    and detection of some other CPU vendors.
  * Now both release and test binaries are available to build
    into separate subdirectories independently.
  * Improved built-in resource generation tool.
  * Embedded resources are now alphabetically sorted to make the
    build more deterministic.
  * Added support of built-in presets for plugin's UI.

- Dropped lsp-plugins-verbose.patch (using a different method to
  have verbose build)

- Enabled ppc64 build

Tue Jun 18 11:52:11 UTC 2019 - Luigi Baldoni <aloisio@gmx.com>

- Update to version 1.1.9
  * Added experimental support of AArch64 architecture (DSP code
    is not optimized yet).
  * Fixed regression in VST and Standalone plugin formats that
    caused offline tasks to not to be launched.
  * Improved build system to make source code possible to build
    for KXStudio repository.
    Distribution builders should ensure that the GNU C++
    compiler is selected at the build stage.
  * Additional I/O improvements for better WindowsNT support.
  version 1.1.7:
  * Implemented fully compatible with EqualizerAPO software
    digital filters that are now part of the Parametric Equalizer
    plugin series.
  * Fixed issue that caused VST plugins not to load from cusom
    user-defined path.
  * Some code parts rewritten for better compatibility with
    WindowsNT platform.
  * Fixed file listing in the file dialog that caused improper
    reading of remote directories mounted on the local file
    system.
  * Changed implementation of LV2 MIDI transport so now plugins
    utilize only one LV2:Atom input port and one LV2:Atom output
    port.
  * Fixed bug in host<->UI time and position synchronization for
    VST plugin format.
  * Fixed AVX+FMA3 implementation of dynamic biquadratic filters
    that caused improper behaviour of the Multi-band compressor
    plugin on machines that support AVX and FMA3 instruction set.
  * Multiband compressor now properly handles the 'Bypass'
    button.
  * Fixed return of improper extension pointers when requested
    extension is different to the ui:idleInterface.
  * Fixed bug in dynamic processor plugin that could issue
    invalid metering values.
  * Fixed UI size issue for VST plugins in Cockos Reaper.
  * Fixed numerous memory leakage issues in UI components.
  * Fixed spontaneous crashes when destroying the Profiler
    Mono/Stereo plugin.
  * Fixed embedded resource generation tool that had invalid
    behaviour for several file systems.
  * Reimplemented I/O subsystem.

- Dropped _service and fix-setting-paths.patch (no longer
  necessary)
