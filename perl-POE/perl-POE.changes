  ================================
  
    commit 4f2ef10e7039f96659757f9e5097c45fc57cace1
    Author: Rocco Caputo <rcaputo@cpan.org>
    Date:   Wed Jun 3 10:10:18 2015 -0400
    
      Version bump for release.
  
    commit 208a5bf377f6b8c2064e927efd4bd331ab2016c2
    Merge: e9377b1 6e0f41e
    Author: Rocco Caputo <rcaputo@cpan.org>
    Date:   Tue Jun 2 15:17:24 2015 -0400
    
      Merge pull request #22 from zhouzhen1/prchallenge
  
      Some trivial changes for the CPAN PR challenge.
  
    commit e9377b10c19c11ed1d3e5d34040b2dcf90227a51
    Author: Rocco Caputo <rcaputo@cpan.org>
    Date:   Tue Jun 2 14:37:40 2015 -0400
    
      rt.cpan.org 96039. Avoid close() on a FIFO until the reader is done.
  
      Cygwin seems to block on close() if a FIFO contains data. This test
      deadlocks because it expects the ability to read from the FIFO
      asynchronously later.
  
    commit 882a097209c2b6e02ccd31f3fb32c24bed73cdb6
    Author: Sulev-Madis Silber (ketas) <madis555@hot.ee>
    Date:   Tue Jun 2 13:58:57 2015 -0400
    
      rt.cpan.org 100499. Fix SuccessEvent values for AF_INET6.
  
      Applied ketas' micro patches, and updated an example in the docs.
  
    commit e60ea6c5b7c8ae1b50fefeed336393e18df9a474
    Author: Rocco Caputo <rcaputo@cpan.org>
    Date:   Tue Jun 2 09:08:59 2015 -0400
    
      rt.cpan.org 101227. Comment on an unused assertion.

    commit a888ad45a0eef04fa2aa476e60c54a13a54fd668
    Merge: 4feeb50 d6ac082
    Author: Rocco Caputo <rcaputo@cpan.org>
    Date:   Mon Feb 23 15:09:52 2015 -0500
    
      Merge pull request #20 from nanis/nanis-fix-for-nmake
  
      Hard coded Unix-style directory separator causes problems on Windows
      with nmake
  
    commit 2e4f77ac8a675453270bc7529ce9c8a4eb498a24
    Author: Chris 'BinGOs' Williams <chris@bingosnet.co.uk>
    Date:   Sat Feb 21 15:45:21 2015 +0000
    
      Enable bind for IN6ADDR_ANY
  
    commit d6ac082351191b359d33b92e731748d56b8014dc
    Author: A. Sinan Unur <nanis@cpan.org>
    Date:   Fri Dec 19 13:57:00 2014 -0500
    
      Use File::Spec->catfile to compose certain paths
  
      Surrounding them with double quotes worked on Windows, but created
      problems on other systems.
  
    commit 36a15cfb9bd929c60f86089bbdab8a883a835cc5
    Author: A. Sinan Unur <nanis@cpan.org>
    Date:   Fri Dec 19 13:41:38 2014 -0500
    
      Quote paths to fix errors with nmake on Windows
  
      C:\...\POE-1.366> nmake test
  
      "C:\opt\perl-5.20.1in\perl.exe" mylib/gen-tests.perl lib/POE.pm
      Can't open perl script "mylib": Permission denied NMAKE : fatal error
      U1077: 'C:\opt\perl-5.20.1in\perl.exe' : return code '0xd' Stop.
  
      This happens because perl ends up seeing mylib and /gen-tests.perl as
      two separate thingies. It seemed to me that the most straightforward
      solution which I do not think should effect any other platforms is to
      quote the filename arguments. Hope this makes sense.
  
    commit ee3a45043e210fcbf51b6ba4c44b8cd618ca1a37
    Author: Rocco Caputo <rcaputo@cpan.org>

    Author: Tobias Leich <email@froggs.de>
    Date:   Wed Nov 5 10:54:21 2014 +0100

  2014-11-03 13:39:18 -0500 v1_366
  ================================
  
    commit 63e55125e55b4220984cc51dc3eb68ae1eb9cb21
    Author: Rocco Caputo <rcaputo@cpan.org>
    Date:   Mon Nov 3 13:39:18 2014 -0500
    
      Bump versions and dependencies for release.
  
    commit b800fb63188ac415b9f706428289d89b9d90e32f
    Author: Rocco Caputo <rcaputo@cpan.org>
    Date:   Fri Oct 31 12:23:41 2014 -0400
    
      Fall back to getprotobyname() if Socket doesn't export IPPROTO_TCP or
      IPPROTO_UDP.
  
      CPAN testers were failing POE because Socket didn't provide these on
      the full range of test machines. The common thread seems to be Perl
      prior to 5.9. While quite old, there's no compelling reason not to
      support it.
  
      This change also caches the protocol numbers at startup, rather than
      looking them up every time. It should be slightly faster as a result.
  
    commit 90d04a311e463749dfeb10f3032866a723e7ca82
    Author: Philip Gwyn <gwyn@cpan.org>
    Date:   Fri Oct 31 11:12:11 2014 -0400
    
      [rt.cpan.org 91406] Use empty string instead of undef for __DIE__
      handler.
  
      The rt.cpan.org bug alleges that the empty string is more compatible.
      It doesn't seem to make a difference for contemporary versions of
      Perl, so why not?
  
    commit c6f8e4f9dabbef51a75dbb043c01c92807fc604c
    Author: Rocco Caputo <rcaputo@cpan.org>
    Date:   Thu Oct 30 12:26:25 2014 -0400
    
      Trigger POE::Session _stop handlers when POE::Kernel->stop() is
      called.
  
    commit ad6056b4bf5f928f87694fb274b7f30ae1534eb7
    Author: Rocco Caputo <rcaputo@cpan.org>
    Date:   Thu Oct 30 12:18:00 2014 -0400
    
      Remove Data::Dump. It's not used, but use() is FAILing tests.
  
    commit 4d3cc9fb8310050b4854a5f17ebb3821a870edae
    Author: Rocco Caputo <rcaputo@cpan.org>
    Date:   Thu Oct 2 16:12:42 2014 -0400
    
      Clarify the "now running in a different process" warning.

    commit ac32695a49330c0543eb985c7e7024f29b14ea28
    Author: Rocco Caputo <rcaputo@cpan.org>
    Date:   Wed Oct 1 19:38:47 2014 -0400
    
      Bump the version for release.
  
    commit 0ffe08ceb164a53003a28364b9a9e3012961ecbb
    Author: Rocco Caputo <rcaputo@cpan.org>
    Date:   Wed Oct 1 19:28:11 2014 -0400
    
      Expose exceptions thrown from SIGDIE handlers.
  
      This change causes both the error that triggered a SIGDIE and the
      error within the SIGDIE handler to be rethrown together.
  
    commit 786a6080bf3df744ad91d0b108ea2e4143a59e07
    Author: Rocco Caputo <rcaputo@cpan.org>
    Date:   Wed Oct 1 19:22:25 2014 -0400
    
      Add a failing test case for reporting die() from within SIGDIE.
  
      Grinnz provided this test case on Freenode #perl. It shows that die()
      within a SIGDIE handler is not reported. Instead, the original error
      is thrown without any indication why it wasn't handled as intended.
  
    commit 2eacf6bb69ab0843ed02a842a58de676c1cde06e
    Author: Rocco Caputo <rcaputo@cpan.org>
    Date:   Mon Sep 29 08:58:50 2014 -0400
    
      SeekBack of 0 is fine on special files.
  
      Problem found by coworkers at Plixer International.
  
    commit 1092eff5dfde3ebc9db1f7e0948e332d794b38a7
    Author: Rocco Caputo <rcaputo@cpan.org>
    Date:   Fri Sep 12 13:57:31 2014 -0400
    
      Import carp() into POE::Filter::HTTPD.
  
      Passing a bogus parameter to POE::Filter::HTTPD->new() caused a
      complaint that carp() wasn't defined, rather than the proper
      complaint the carp() call was making.
  
      Thanks go to gbjk for passing on an anonymous report in IRC.
  
    commit 3155fff17f189be2674fb7870c8fc9d289392c37
    Author: Brian Fraser <fraserbn@gmail.com>
    Date:   Sun Jul 27 03:25:47 2014 +0200
    
      Workaround for systems without getprotobyn* (e.g. android)

  + Add doc blurb about pty issues on linux
  + Remove alias_resolve()'s warning if the resolution failed

- update to 1.293
  o Add user continuation parameters to sig() and sig_child().
  o Roll back most of the lexical FIFO event arrays. Going through a
    POE::Queue for this will be a bit slower, but POE::XS::Queue::Array
    may be fast enough.
  o Continue to guarantee FIFO event ordering despite the rollback to
    dumping them in a time-ordered queue. Detect minor time regressions,
    and use the last time value plus a small number when needed. 
  o Fixed a mistake in the alias_list() example code in POE::Kernel
    documentation, spotted by Paul G Webster
  o Chris Benedict reported that Mac OS X returns ESPIPE when accept() is
    aborted, rather than ECONNABORTED everywhere else. Add ESPIPE to the
    list of harmless accept() errors. 
  o Chris Benedict reported that nmap will crash Wheel::SocketFactory
    based things. nmap disconnects before accept() can be called, so
    accept() returns ECONNABORTED. Technically applications can handle
    this themselves and not destroy the wheel, but the wheel maybe
    shouldn't report harmless errors. 
  o Apply Hinrik's patch to increase test failure verbosity.
- 2010-08-02T06:01:19.221768Z v1_292
  o Resolve rt.cpan.org 59925, wherein sig_child() use would increase
    some events' latency to at 1sec. First reported by Getty, then Avar
    opened the ticket. Fixed with Hinrik's copious valuable assistance. 
  o Fix a method name typo in TRACE_REFCNT code.

Tue Jul 27 10:05:00 UTC 2010 - lars@linux-schulserver.de

- update to 1.291:
  + Nick Perez pointed out that we don't absolutely need HighEvent, 
    since put() returns the high-water status much more conveniently. 
    Resolve his rt.cpan.org ticket 56432. 
    Oh, and fix an unrelated test plan.
  + Clarify the refcount_{inc,dec}rement() return values per Olivier
    'dolmen' Mengué's feedback in rt.cpan.org #57314
  + Remove some logic that stopped being used. Adjust idle-kernel checks
    into a slightly more optimal order.
  + Finish a sentence. Incomplete docs noted by Hinrik.
  + Move non-alarms out of POE::Queue::Array.
  + Reduce calls to get_item_count() by one per _data_ev_dispatch_due().
    Reduce calls to get_next_priority() by approx. one per
    _data_ev_dispatch_due(). Micro-optimize get_item_count().
  + Fix tests related to recent POE::Resource::Events optimizations.
  + At long last, apply Ton Hospel's micro-optimization for
    get_next_priority().
  + mall optimizations. Avoid _data_stat_add() calls when not needed.
    Avoid redundant session refcounts when the source and destination are
    the same. Breaks some pedantic tests, but we can fix those.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr  9 23:59:22 UTC 2010 - lars@linux-schulserver.de

- update to 1.289:
  + many test changes
  + documentation fixes
  + Avoid undefined value warnings when trying to tab-complete
    nothingness.
  + Tweak the @modules logic
  + Remove any XS modules from @modules
  + Fix loading of XS loops via POE.pm

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Feb 20 12:27:57 UTC 2010 - lars@linux-schulserver.de

- update to 1.287:
  + Fix a sig_child() race condition in a MooseX::Workers test case
  + Fix an infinite file rollover when open() succeeds but stat() fails.
    Jay Hannah discovered a bug when he passed in a filename with
    trailing whitespace. Two-parameter open() treats trailing whitespace
    as insignificant, so it passed. On the other hand, trailing
    whitespace is significant in stat(), so it always failed, triggering
    an unrelenting stream of file rollover events. Switched to
    three-parameter open(), which considers trailing whitespace as
    significant. Now both open() and stat() agree the file doesn't exist.
  + Removed dependency on Test::Exception
  + Resolve rt.cpan.org #54319. In polling mode, the wheel wasn't
    iterating get_one() for the entire input from get_one_start(). As a
    result, only one log line was returned per PollInterval. This change
    iterates through get_one() until all lines are returned.
  + Restore _start & _stop return values. Mikko Ehto reported that 
    _start and _stop don't return values as documented. He
    also provided a testcase, which was very helpful. 
  + fixed a bug in POE::Wheel::FollowTail 
  + fixed spelling mistakes
  + several doc changes
