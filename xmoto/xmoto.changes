Fri May 19 22:18:19 CEST 2006 - sndirsch@suse.de

- updated to release 0.1.14
 * New version numbering policy: If the last number is even it's

   version (from CVS).
 * Major bug in the player head/entity collision detection code fixed.

 * Integration with Nicolas Adenis-Lamarre's website; World records 
   can now be seen inside the game, and new levels can be downloaded
   automatically.

   by ./configure, the online high-score system is disabled, so please
   install libcurl (version 3) before upgrading to X-Moto 0.1.14. 
   (This does not affect X-Moto on Windows, libcurl is included with 
   the game there).
 * Slight physics adjustment: It should no longer be possible to fall
   through the ground when standing still. Stay calm, this should NOT 
   affect the gameplay.

    be seen in the "External Levels" list.

    replay isn't found.
  * Made a change that hopefully should make mouse movement less
    inresponsive on some systems.
  * Integrated a patch by Eric Piel that makes the game play more
    smooth, most notable on lower end systems.
  * Added a (hopefully) better set of build configuration scripts,
    also by Eric Piel. Please notify me if some compatibility is 
    broken by this, and I'll try to fix it as fast as possible.
  * New -benchmark option to play with.
  * The user is now warned if he's entering a level with 
    geometrical errors.

   Windows, so there's no longer a stdout.txt).

   on Mac OS X (thanks again Maxime Biais).

   the ones made by the current player.

    picked-up strawberries are no longer gone when 
    rewinding).
  * Applied MacOS X patch by Maxime Biais.
  * Replays can no longer be recorded for levels that 
    include scripting.
  * Older releases will not be able to read the new 
    replays, but this version can read old replays 
    without any problems (in which case the new event
    features will be missing).
  * Faster building procedure on Windows.
  * New built-in levels, one of them by Clive Crous.
  * New tutorial levels. These are now considered external
    levels, so you'll find them under that tab.
  * Smoother playback of replays.
  * Note that I have given up ordering the built-in levels
    by difficulty. The current order will be kept until
    beta.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
