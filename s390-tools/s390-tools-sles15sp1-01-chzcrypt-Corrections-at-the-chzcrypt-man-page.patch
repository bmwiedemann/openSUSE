Subject: zcrypt: Corrections at the chzcrypt man page.
From: Harald Freudenberger <freude@linux.ibm.com>

Summary:     lszcrypt: support for alternate zcrypt device drivers
Description: With kernel 4.19 there comes an extension to the
             existing AP bus which supports alternate zcrypt
             drivers. For details about this see kernel patch
             "s390/zcrypt: AP bus support for alternate
             driver(s)". So now lszcrypt displays the driver name
             in verbose mode. As some of the information
             displayed by lszcrypt was based on sysfs attributes,
             which are only available when the default zcrypt
             driver is bound to the device, this also needed some
             rework. If a sysfs attribute is not available
             because of an alternate driver binding (or no
             driver) a question mark is printed into the field.

             zcrypt: Corrections at the chzcrypt man page.

             Fixed typo and added one sentence to explain more details
             about online switching of queue devices.
