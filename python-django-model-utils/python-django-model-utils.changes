- Update to version 2.0
  + BACKWARDS-INCOMPATIBLE: Indexing into a ``Choices`` instance now
    translates database representations to human-readable choice names,
    rather than simply indexing into an array of choice tuples. (Indexing
    into ``Choices`` was previously not documented.) If you have code
    that is relying on indexing or slicing ``Choices``, the simplest 
    workaround is to change e.g. ``STATUS[1:]`` to ``list(STATUS)[1:]``.
  + Fixed bug with checking for field name conflicts for added query
    managers on `StatusModel`.
  + Can pass `choices_name` to `StatusField` to use a different name
    for choices class attribute. ``STATUS`` is used by default.
  + Can pass model subclasses, rather than strings, into `select_subclasses()`
  + Deepcopying a `Choices` instance no longer fails with infinite
    recursion in `getattr`.
  + `get_subclass()` method is now available on both managers and querysets
  + Fix bug in `InheritanceManager` with grandchild classes on Django 1.6+;
    `select_subclasses('child', 'child__grandchild')` would only ever get
    to the child class.
   + MonitorField now accepts a 'when' parameter. It will update only
     when the field changes to one of the values specified.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Sep 28 13:08:58 UTC 2013 - p.drouand@gmail.com

- Update to version 1.5.0
  + Choices now accepts option-groupings. Fixes GH-14.
  + Choices can now be added to other Choices or to any iterable, and can
    be compared for equality with itself.
  + Choices now __contains__ its Python identifier values.
  + Fixed a bug causing KeyError when saving with the parameter update
   _fields in which there are untracked fields.
 +  Fixed FieldTracker usage on inherited models. Fixes GH-57.
 +  Added mutable field support to FieldTracker

Mon Jan 28 03:33:12 UTC 2013 - alexandre@exatati.com.br

- Update to 1.2.0:
  - Moved primary development from Bitbucket to GitHub. Bitbucket
    mirror will continue to receive updates; Bitbucket issue tracker
    will be closed once all issues tracked in it are resolved.
  - Removed deprecated ChoiceEnum, InheritanceCastModel,
    InheritanceCastManager, and manager_from.
  - Fixed pickling of PassThroughManager. Thanks Rinat Shigapov.
  - Set use_for_related_fields = True on QueryManager.
  - Added __len__ method to Choices. Thanks Ryan Kaskel and James
    Oakley.
  - Fixed InheritanceQuerySet on Django 1.5. Thanks Javier García
    Sogo.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Apr 14 15:23:22 UTC 2012 - alexandre@exatati.com.br

- Update to 1.1.0:
  - Updated AutoCreatedField, AutoLastModifiedField, MonitorField, and
    TimeFramedModel to use ``django.utils.timezone.now`` on Django 1.4.
    Thanks Donald Stufft.
  - Fixed annotation of InheritanceQuerysets. Thanks Jeff Elmore and Facundo
    Gaich.
  - Dropped support for Python 2.5 and Django 1.1. Both are no longer supported
    even for security fixes, and should not be used.
  - Added ``PassThroughManager.for_queryset_class()``, which fixes use of
    ``PassThroughManager`` with related fields. Thanks Ryan Kaskel for report and
    fix.
- Added ``InheritanceManager.get_subclass()``. Thanks smacker.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun 17 00:56:14 UTC 2011 - alexandre@exatati.com.br

- Update to 1.0.0:
  - Fixed using SplitField on an abstract base model.
  - Fixed issue #8, adding ``use_for_related_fields = True`` to
    ``InheritanceManager``.
  - Added ``PassThroughManager``. Thanks Paul McLanahan.
  - Added pending-deprecation warnings for ``InheritanceCastModel``,
    ``manager_from``, and Django 1.1 support. Removed documentation for the
    deprecated utilities. Bumped ``ChoiceEnum`` from pending-deprecation to
    deprecation.
  - Fixed issue #6, bug with InheritanceManager and descriptor fields (e.g.
    FileField).  Thanks zyegfryed for the fix and sayane for tests.
- Regenerate spec file with py2pack.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb 18 23:35:03 UTC 2011 - alexandre@exatati.com.br

- Update to 0.6.0:
  - Updated SplitField to define get_prep_value rather than
    get_db_prep_value. This avoids deprecation warnings on Django
    trunk/1.3, but makes SplitField incompatible with Django
    versions prior to 1.2.
  - Added InheritanceManager, a better approach to selecting
    subclass instances for Django 1.2+. Thanks Jeff Elmore.
  - Added InheritanceCastManager and InheritanceCastQuerySet, to
    allow bulk casting of a queryset to child types. Thanks Gregor
    Müllegger.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
