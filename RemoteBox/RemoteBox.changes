- Added option to select between Video and Audio, Video Only or 
  Audio Only when screen capturing
- Added support for VirtualBox VGA card with VMware SVGA II

  virtual graphics card.

- The Audio Input and Audio Output options can now also be set 
  while the guest is running

  Manager dialog accessible from the file menu

  adding, editing and deleting

  share's Permanent Status, when editing the shared folder.

- Update to 2.5 version
  - RemoteBox now only pops up a VirtualBox Extensions warning 
    dialog on login, for server operating systems that have them 
    available but the extension pack
    is not installed. Currently this is Linux, Solaris, Windows and 
    MacOS X. Others such as FreeBSD will just get a warning in the 
    message log as there are no VirtualBox extensions.
  - Added support for setting the Audio driver of a guest when 
    using a FreeBSD server
  - Improved the code which automatically adds the guest addition 
    ISO to the VMM on login which should prevent an error if the 
    server does not provide a guest additions ISO
  - Added support for VNC. If your server has the VNC extension 
    pack installed, you can use VNC to connect to the guest 
    displays instead of RDP. You must install a VNC client on your 
    RemoteBox machine and configured it as appropriate in your 
    preferences. TigerVNC is the default client
  - The guest display icon now shows whether the server expects 
    a VNC or RDP connection when opening the display of guests.
  - Added option to change the floppy drive type to 360k, 720k, 
    1.44MB, 2.88MB, 15.6MB and 63.5MB.
  - Added a button to assist with the automatic generation of 
    serial port paths
  - Fixed a bug causing the port path setting to be reset with the 
    defaults
  - Fixed audio support for Solaris servers. The SolAudio driver is 
    non functional in VirtualBox and has been replaced with OSS.

reports this as a valid minimum, the guest won't start.

Thu Apr  2 17:25:35 UTC 2015 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Manually symlink the duplicate icon between /usr/share/icons and
  /usr/share/RemoteBox. This allows us, contrary to the use of
  fdupes, to define that we want the real file in /usr/share/icons,
  which is a requirement for Application containerisation (the icon
  needs to be extractable from a defined location for host system
  integration).
