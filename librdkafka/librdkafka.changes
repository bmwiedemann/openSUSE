- update to 1.1.0:
  * SASL OAUTHBEARER support
  * In-memory SSL certificates (PEM, DER, PKCS#12) support
  * Pluggable broker SSL certificate verification callback
  * ssl.endpoint.identification.algorithm=https (off by default) to validate
    the broker hostname matches the certificate. Requires OpenSSL >= 1.0.2.
  * Improved GSSAPI/Kerberos ticket refresh
  * SSL peer (broker) certificate verification is now enabled by default
    (disable with enable.ssl.certificate.verification=false)
  * %{broker.name} is no longer supported in sasl.kerberos.kinit.cmd since
    kinit refresh is no longer executed per broker, but per client instance.
  * SASL GSSAPI/Kerberos: Don't run kinit refresh for each broker,
    just per client instance.
  * SASL GSSAPI/Kerberos: Changed sasl.kerberos.kinit.cmd to first attempt
    ticket refresh, then acquire.
  * SASL: Proper locking on broker name acquisition.
  * Consumer: max.poll.interval.ms now correctly handles blocking poll calls,
    allowing a longer poll timeout than the max poll interval.
  * configure: Fix libzstd static lib detection
  * rdkafka_performance: Fix for Misleading "All messages delivered!" message

- update to version 1.0.1:
  * Fix consumer stall when broker connection goes down
  * Fix AdminAPI memory leak when broker does not support request
  * Update/fix protocol error response codes
  * Treat ECONNRESET as standard Disconnects

- update to version 1.0.0:
  * This release changes configuration defaults and deprecates a set
    of configuration properties, make sure to read the Upgrade considerations
    section from https://github.com/edenhill/librdkafka/releases/tag/v1.0.0
  * add support for Idempotent Producer, providing exactly-once
    producing and guaranteed ordering of messages.
  * In previous releases librdkafka would maintain open connections to all
    brokers in the cluster and the bootstrap servers.
    With this release librdkafka now connects to a single bootstrap server
    to retrieve the full broker list, and then connects to the brokers
    it needs to communicate with: partition leaders, group coordinators, etc.
    For large scale deployments this greatly reduces the number of connections
    between clients and brokers, and avoids the repeated idle connection closes
    for unused connections.
