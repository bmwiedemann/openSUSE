    [Fixed]
  
    - Application of layers to handles during and after capture now attempts
      to more accurately duplicate the original layers, including potential
      duplicate layers.  Because of the unusual ways that layers are ordered
      and applied, exact duplication is not guaranteeed, but this should be
      better that what Capture::Tiny did before.
  
    - Avoids a hard crash on Windows with Perl < 5.20 if a fork occurs in a
      capture block.  Also documented the risks and lack of support for
      forks in capture blocks.

    Fixed:

      (which started warning during the perl 5.21.x series,
      causing tests to fail)

    Tests:
  
    - Removes test that optionally uses Inline::C to avoid spurious
      test failures.  Also Inline::C had become a fairly heavy
      (if optional) dependency.
  
    Docs:
  
    - Clarify that PERL_CAPTURE_TINY_TIMEOUT is an internal control,
      not a timeout of the code reference being captured.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Feb  7 16:23:00 UTC 2015 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to 0.27
   Prereqs:
   - Make Inline::C recommended, not required
   Tests:
   - Actually check for Inline::C in tests, not just Inline

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 15 16:01:08 UTC 2014 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to 0.25
  Prereqs:
  - Amended recommended modules to list Inline::C rather than Inline

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov 26 07:35:33 UTC 2013 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to 0.23
   Fixed:
 
   - minimum Perl prereq is back to 5.6 (but $diety help you if
     you're still stuck on 5.6)
 
   Documented:
 
   - Added warning about using @_ in a capture block

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun  4 14:46:18 UTC 2013 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to 0.22
 
   Documented:
 
   - Issue tracker is now github
 
   Changed:
 
   - Skips tee and leak tests for closed STDIN on Perl prior to
     5.12 when PERL_UNICODE=D.  Documented lack of support as
     a known issue.
 
   - Isolated tee subprocesses from effects of PERL_UNICODE as a
     precaution (though this did not fix the above issue).
 
   - Improved layer detection for handles proxied due to being closed
     or tied.
 
   Fixed:
 
   - Nested merged captures that include an external program call no longer
     leak STDERR to the outer scope [rt.cpan.org #79376]
 
   - Work around rt.perl.org #114404 by forcing PerlIO layers back on
     original handles [rt.cpan.org #78819]
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 23 13:21:03 UTC 2012 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to 0.18
  Added

  - When capture or tee are called in void context, Capture::Tiny
    skips reading back from the capture handles if it can do so safely

  Fixed:

  - Tied STDIN is always localized before redirections to avoid tees
    hanging on MSWin32
    
  - Copying and reopening STDIN is necessary to avoid tees hanging on MSWin32.

  Fixed:

  - Avoids reopening STDIN while setting up a capture, which avoids
    some problems with pathological tied filehandle implementations
    such as in FCGI

  Tested:

  - Re-enabled tied STDIN testing for MSWin32 to see if changes above
    avoid crashes seen historically

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb 27 08:43:08 UTC 2012 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to 0.17
  Fixed:
  - Added a workaround for failing t/08-stdin-closed.t under blead
    perl / 5.15.8 [RT#111070]

  Documented:
  - Clarified some limitations; added a link to CPAN Testers Matrix;
    removed redundant BUGS section; standardized terminology

  Tested:
  - Added a test using Inline::C to print to stdout and stderr in response
    to RT#71701

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb 21 09:02:47 UTC 2012 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to 0.16
  - Noted problems and workaround for FCGI's pathological tied STDIN
    [RT#74681; thank you Karl Gaissmaier for testing the
    workaround]

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Dec 24 10:14:30 UTC 2011 - pascal.bleser@opensuse.org

- update to 0.15:
  * repeated captures from a custom filehandle would return undef instead of
    the empty string (and would warn). This has been fixed. RT#73374
  * commented out debugging code for slightly less runtime overhead

- changes from 0.14:
  * added: capturing with custom filehandles will return only newly appended
    output instead of everything already in the file RT#73374

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec 21 11:59:40 UTC 2011 - pascal.bleser@opensuse.org

- update to 0.13: no user-visible changes
- changes from 0.12:
  - add new functions capture_stdout, capture_stderr, tee_stdout, tee_stderr; RT#60515
  - capture functions also returns the return values from the executed coderef; RT#61794
  - capture functions take optional custom filehandles for capturing via named
    files instead of anonymous ones
  - tied filehandles based on Tie::StdHandle can now use the ":utf8" layer;
    removed remaining TODO tests; adds Scalar::Util as a dependency
  - when Time::HiRes::usleep is available, tee operations will
    sleep during the busy-loop waiting for tee processes to be ready
    RT#67858

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug 26 15:45:14 UTC 2011 - chris@computersalat.de

- fix build for SLE_10
  * %{__perl} -p -i -e 's|6.31|6.30|' Makefile.PL

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul 21 08:55:31 UTC 2011 - coolo@novell.com

- updated to 0.11
  Fixed:
  - Tests will not use Test::Differences version 0.60 or greater
  - Setting PERL_CAPTURE_TINY_TIMEOUT to 0 will disable timeouts
  - Added support for $ENV{PERL_CAPTURE_TINY_TIMEOUT} to control
    the timeout period under 'tee'; tests set not to timeout to
    avoid false FAIL reports on overloaded virtual machine smokers
  Fixed:
  - $@ set within a captured block is no longer lost when the capture
    is completed; likewise, the initial value of $@ is not lost
    during capture (when no subsequent error occurs) (RT #65139)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
