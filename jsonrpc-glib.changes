Sat Mar 19 05:39:54 UTC 2022 - Luciano Santos <luc14n0@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 3.42.0:
  + Documentation improvements to use gi-docgen.
  + Introspection fixes.
- Replace gtk-doc with pkgconfig(gi-docgen) build requirement as
  the new improved way for generating the API documentation.
- Add temporary hacky SED commands to fix the gi-docgen generated
  documentation ending up under /usr/share/doc/ rather than
  /usr/share/doc/PKG_NAME.
- Add jsonrpc-glib-rpmlintrc to filter out the:
  "obsolete-not-provided typelib-1_0-Jsonrpc-1.0" since there's no
  need to do so as we already used the capability typelib(foobar),
  for requirements, before the renaming.

Wed Jul  3 11:25:06 UTC 2019 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

  + Ensure JsonrpcClient::failed is emitted in panic.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 14 04:26:58 UTC 2018 - luc14n0@linuxmail.org

- Update to version 3.28.0:
  + No visible changes.
- Update URL tag to https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/jsonrpc-glib:
  the closest thing to a web page currently.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb 28 16:33:47 UTC 2018 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Modernize spec-file by calling spec-cleaner

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb 21 16:22:38 UTC 2018 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 3.27.91:
  + Add JsonrpcServer::client-accepted signal.
  + Improvements to dispatching of errors when panic'ing the
    connection.
  + Message parsing is more liberal in what it accepts as input.
  + Default ABI visibility was set to hidden, making our ABI macros
    useful.
- Update license tag to SPDX-3.0 format: LGPL-2.1-or-later.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb  5 12:10:46 UTC 2018 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 3.27.90:
  + More documentation and GObject Introspection additions.
  + Fixes for documentation and taking of floating references from
    GVariant params.
  + The soname has been bumped since we altered the correctness of
    GVariant params. C-based programs mostly just need to be
    recompiled. Other bindings-based consumers should have their
    bindings regenerated if necessary.
  + When panic'ing a connection (such as from a broken pipe) we now
    defer error propagation back to the main loop to avoid some
    re-entrancy complexity for applications.
- Bump sover to 1_0-1 and rename the library packages to
  libjsonrpc-glib-1_0-1, following upstreams change.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan 12 03:16:19 UTC 2018 - luc14n0@linuxmail.org

  + The JSONRPC_MESSAGE_NEW_ARRAY() macro was added to allow for
    creating GVariant messages that are an array.
  + A number of conformance tests were added.
  + JsonrpcClient allows for detailed signals (G_SIGNAL_DETAILED)
    for notification and handle-call signals.
  + JsonrpcServer gained new functionality to enumerate the number
    of connected clients.
  + JsonrpcClient tries to hold on to an additional reference when
    panic is called.
  + Message parsing can now support NULL strings using maybe types
    when encoding and decoding messages.
- Update package descriptions making it shorter and more assertive.
- Add gio-unix-2.0 and glib-2.0 pkgconfig modules BuildRequires:
  They were being pulled with gio-2.0 pkgconfig module and used
  already as all of them live in glib2-devel package.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct 19 11:28:06 UTC 2017 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 3.27.1:
  + jsonrpc-glib now uses versioning macros similar to GLib or Gtk
    instead of a custom linker script for ABI exports.

Thu Oct  5 01:41:06 UTC 2017 - luc14n0@linuxmail.org

    but previously we were relying on the default GCC flags to do
    so.
  + Fix improper use of va_list on non-Intel architectures.
  + JsonrpcOutputStream now properly checks for pending operations
    before flushing, so that an error is not incorrectly
    synthesized.
  + Improved error propagation from data streams.
  + Correctness fixes for stress tests.
