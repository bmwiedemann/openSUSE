- Update to 2.4.0
  * Modifications for atop:
    + Support for Nvidia GPU statistics:
      A separate daemon atopgpud has been developed to maintain statistics of
	  Nvidia GPUs in the system. When this daemon is running, atop will
	  connect to this daemon and will get/show the GPU statistics with every
	  interval on system level and process level (key 'e').
      The atopgpud daemon will only be active when it is explicitly enabled 
	  (see man pages for more info).
    + Support for Infiniband statistics:
      Counters showing the bandwidth utilization of Infiniband ports
	  (system level) are added.
    + Support for Pressure Stall Information (PSI):
      The average pressure percentages of CPU, memory and I/O are reported
	  for the last 10, 60 and 300 seconds. These percentage are provided from
	  kernel 4.20 onwards.
    + Faster startup of atop:
      The allocation strategy for processes and threads has been improved,
	  which will specifically be noticable on larger systems with lots of
	  multi-threaded processes.
    + Configurable options for atop running in the background:
      Default options of script atop.daily can be overruled by
	  /etc/default/atop file.
    + CPU Instructions Per Cycle (IPC):
      For every CPU, the average number of instructions per CPU cycle is
	  shown as 'ipc'. Besides, a column is shown with the number of cycles
	  executed per second as `cycl` (shown as effective Hz frequency).
    + Various fixes:
      Various NFS counters corrected.
      Recognition of nvme and nbd disks.
      Recognition of DEADLINE scheduling policy.
      Proper handling of memory locking (improper handling caused malloc
	  failures in previous versions).
  * New program atopconvert:
    + This program can be used to convert the layout of older raw files to
	  newer raw files. Raw files from atop 2.0 onwards can be converted to
	  the newest version (now: 2.4).
  * Modifications for atopsar:
    + Reports can be printed now about the utilization of GPUs and Infiniband,
	  and about the PSI percentages.
  * General:
    + The format of the raw file is incompatible with earlier versions.
	  However, old raw files can be converted now by the program atopconvert
	  to be read or extended by newer atop versions.
- Clean with spec-cleaner
- Refresh atop-makefile.patch

- Update to 2.3:
  * Modifications for atop:
    + Support for Docker containers.
    + Improved gathering of process data.
    + Improved memory figures for processes.
    + Variable width for PID column.
    + Better handling when started via sudo (not entering stopped
    + state).
    + Handling of disk drives starting with 'xvd...'.
  * Modifications for atopacct:
    + Better error handling of Netlink interface.
    + Immediate reaction when receiving SIGTERM signal.
    + Bypass for kernel bug 190711 (Netlink interface not
      available).
    + Bypass for kernel bug 190271 (process accounting does not
      always start).
  * Modifications for atopsar:
    + Top-3 of resource consuming processes only shows active
      processes now.
  * General:
    + The format of the raw file is upward compatible with version
      2.2-3.

- update to 2.2:
     * Modifications for atop:
         a. New keys for process selection:
            '/' to select processes containing a particular search string in the command line arguments.
            'I' to select processes running with particular PIDs.
         b. New counters for NFS activity:
            On system level, counters are maintained about NFS traffic. Three new labels are introduced for this purpose:
            'NFS' for NFS server statistics (overall).
            'NFC' for NFS client statistics (overall).
            'NFM' for NFS client statistics per mounted NFS filesystem (so multiple lines possible).
         c. New counters for OpenVZ containers:
            CPU consumption and memory occupation are shown per container on system level (label 'CON').
            Container ID and virtual PID are shown on process level (when using key 'v' or 's').
         d. Bug fixes:
            The maximum transfer rate larger than 1 Gbit for ethernet interfaces is now correctly shown.
            The maximum transfer rate for wifi connections is now shown.
            For interfaces in general, the maximum transfer rate is shown as a separate column ('sp').
            
            Counters about virtual disk type 'xvd[a-z]' are shown.
            
            Several minor bugs have been solved.
     * Modifications for atopacct:
         a. Avoid that process accounting is reactivated too frequently (and unnecessary).
     * Modifications for atopsar:
         a. Add flags for NFS traffic ('-n' for NFS mounts, '-j' for overall NFS 
            client activity and '-J' for overall NFS server activity).
     * General:
         a. Support for systemd-based distributions has been added.
         b. The format of the raw file is incompatible with earlier versions. However, 
            the earlier version of atop is automatically activated when accessing an 
            older raw file.
- cleanup spec file - remove support for < 12.1

Sat Oct 18 12:40:40 UTC 2014 - pascal.bleser@opensuse.org

- update to 2.1:
  * OpenVZ support: virtual environment identifier per process (envID)
  * Bug solution: when the screen-width is larger than the total number of
    columns to be printed, empty columns are added, however one column too many
  * Removed useless empty column for memory statistics
  * Introduce the 'G' key to suppress showing/accumulating exited processes
    in the output
  * Support CPU frequencies for systems with Intel P-state driver
  * Introduction of new daemon atopacctd. This daemon switches on process
    accounting and transfers every accounting record to an accounting shadow
    file. The source accounting file will regularly be truncated, while the
    shadow files are written with a limited size in a queued way. Non-used
    shadow files are deleted regularly.
  * Bug-solution: segmentation fault when one of the process names in the
    system contains a newline
  * Introduce configurable colors: in the atoprc file, colors can be defined
    for information messages (default green), threads (default yellow), almost
    critical resources (default cyan) and critical resources (default red).
  * Limit the names of network interfaces to six characters max
  * Introduction of proportional memory size (PSIZE) per process. For the
    resident memory parts used by a process that are shared with other
    processes, only a proportional part (shared memory part divided by the
    number of sharers) is accounted to the process. Since the gathering of this
    value is rather time-consuming (reading the smaps file of every process),
    it is optional ('R' key or '-R' flag).
  * Increased number of LVMs and disks supported
  * Support for huge pages (total and in use).

  * service file for systemd
  * solved division-by-zero when maxfreq=0 and more precise coloring of
    concerning CPU-values when CPU overloaded

  * improved error handling when not enough columns or lines
  * suppress sorting of system resources by key F or flag -F (toggle)

  * numerous cosmetic changes and man-page updates
  * improved screen handling
  * limited maximum file-size for process accounting file (200 MiB)
  * improved handling of process accounting
  * new key 'S' to make selections of system resources like logical volumes,
    disks and network interfaces (regular expression)
  * use of arrow-keys and PgUp/PgDown for vertical scroll
  * use of -> and <- keys for horizontal scroll of command line
  * support statistics for virtio disks (vd*)
  * fetching and displaying of individual threads
  * add various details about the memory usage of processes, like stack size,
    data size, shared library size and size used on swap
  * show new value about swap space usage per process
  * colors are shown now for separate system-level counters instead of for the
    entire line with counters
  * enhanced security: improved dropping of root privileges

Tue Mar 15 02:13:10 UTC 2011 - pascal.bleser@opensuse.org

- update to 1.26:
  * an additional value is shown for the current frequency and the current
    scaling percentage of the CPU
  * additional system-level counters are shown for the total number of threads
    that are running, sleeping interruptible, and sleeping uninterruptible
  * when the number of lines in a window is too small for the amount of
    system-level lines, the number of variable resources (like disks,
    interfaces, etc.) is limited automatically to be able to continue
  * the signal SIGUSR2 can be sent to atop to take one more sample and
    terminate (e.g. used to speed up suspend/hibernate)
  * support for the disk type 'mmcblk'

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May  3 12:18:43 UTC 2010 - pascal.bleser@opensuse.org
