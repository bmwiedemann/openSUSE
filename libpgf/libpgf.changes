- Update to version 7.15.32:
  * This version improves the reuse of CPGFImage objects for
    several decoding operations. It clarifies the usage of
    CPGFImage::Close() and CPGFImage::Destroy() by deletion of
    Close(). Several reading operations can be performed in the
    following way: Open(), Read(), GetBitmap(), ResetStreamPos(),
    Read(), GetBitmap(), ResetStreamPos(), ... Calling Destroy()
    frees all allocated ressources and reinitializes the object to
    the same state as the constructor does. This allows the reuse
    of the CPGFImage object for encoding and decoding: SetHeader(),
    ImportBitmap(), Write(), ResetStreamPos(), Destroy(), Open(),
    Read(), GetBitmap()
  * Caching or skipping of user data (meta data) while opening a
    PGF image can be controlled by a new UserdataPolicy in
    ConfigureDecoder().
  From version 7.15.25:
  * In case you use the ROI decoding, we strongly encourage using
    version 7.15.25 instead of an older version.
  * This version fixes some decoder bugs only seen in ROI decoding.
    ROI decoding is now also supported for Bitmap and RGB12 image
    modes.
  * This version introduces a new and more efficient data format
    for binary images (bitmaps). The new format allows ROI
    decoding. The decoder supports both the old and the new format,
    but ROI decoding works only with the new format.
  * The two reserverd bytes in PGFHeader are now used for a more
    detailled PGF version number.
- Removed libpgf-r147.patch and libpgf-r148.patch (fixed upstream).
