How to use mozc.el:
-------------------
After Mozc is installed, "mozc.el" is not enabled automatically since almost
people input Japanese characters through a GTK IM module or XIM.

If you want to use "mozc.el", please describe the following lines in your "~/.emacs":

(require 'mozc)
(setq default-input-method 'japanese-mozc)
