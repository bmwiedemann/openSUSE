%description
This tool helps compacting PDF files generated by the TeX
typesetting system by extracting meta data like page mode and named
destinations (link targets) and saving them in a PDFmark file. The
PDFmark file can then be used by ghostscript when processing the
TeX-generated PDF to make sure that the final output contains correct
page mode and link targets. Such post-processing of TeX-generated PDF
output is often useful to reduce the size of the final PDF document,
e.g. by removing duplicate font sets.
