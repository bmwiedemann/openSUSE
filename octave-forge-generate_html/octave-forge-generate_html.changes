- Update to version 0.3.1
  * Add lacking information to the informational json file (this
    file is written since version 0.3.0 of generate_html).
- Changes from version 0.3.0:
 * Nested namespaces and classes under namespaces are now handled
   in generating the alphabetical function database.
 * Toplevel functions are now in separate files of the alphabetic
   function database, and in the same directory tree as classes
   and namespaces.
 * Function html helptexts are now in a directory tree
   corresponding to that of the alphabetic function database.
 * Add repository link to index page.
 * In the individual options, as returned by `get_html_options'
   and used in html generation, replacement strings ("%...") are
   not considered anymore. Instead, options can be anonymous
   functions which use their arguments to configure the output
   string. So if users manually changed options with replacements,
   they have to do it differently now; looking into the
   `get_html_options.m' file will help to figure out the correct
   way.
 * Add Octave Forge stylesheet, icons, and javascript files.
 * Page margins of Octave Forge additional package documentation
   are now configurable with the Octave Forge stylesheet.

- Update to version 0.1.8
  * Bug fixes
    - html_help_text.m, texi2html.m: Fix a bug that was the cause of unmatched
      </p> tags in the HTML output.

      and Octave Forge header (unordered <ul> </ul> lists are not allowed to be
      nested in <p> </p> blocks).
  * Other changes
    - html_help_text.m: Now entirely based on texi2html.m
    - texi2html.m: Use <dt class="deftypefn"> </dt> blocks both with TexInfo 4.x
      and with TexInfo 5.x.

- Update to version 0.1.7
  * Bug fixes
    - Omit the "News" link if there is no NEWS file, instead of generating an
      error (the NEWS file is optional, according to the manual)
    - Fix broken links on the NEWS, COPYING and overview pages (the link that
      was supposed to point to the index.html of the package)
    - Protect symbols <, > and & by replacing them with the corresponding HTML
      entity (&lt;, &gt; and &amp;) everywhere it makes sense
    - get_txi_files.m: Update the list of ignored *.texi files
    - generate_package_html.m: Let email addresses appear if they exist in
      DESCRIPTION (they were previously hidden because of the < > delimiters)
    - generate_package_html.m: Fix anchor names
    - html_help_text.m: Hide figures only if gnuplot is in use (bug#33180)
    - html_help_text.m: Prevent empty <pre> </pre> blocks (bug#44451)
  * New features
    - Introduce a new %charset variable for header template, which defaults to
      utf-8 (instead of the hard-coded iso-8859-1 that was previously in use)
  * Documentation
    - Add generate_operators to the INDEX
    - Provide minimal (one-line) help text for generate_html_manual
  * Cleanup
