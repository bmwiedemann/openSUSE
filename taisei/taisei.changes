- Update to version 1.1.1
  * Vertical synchronization (vsync) is now disabled by default,
    as it causes percieved input latency for some players.
    If you'd like to use it and/or you have screen tearing
    problems, you should set it to "on" or "adaptive" in the video
    settings.
  * The event/input processing system has been completely
    rewritten, and unicode text input now works correctly.
  * Reimplemented the framerate limiter. It's significantly more
    accurate now and attempts to compensate for sudden frametime
    spikes. This makes the game much more likely to run at exactly
    the intended speed (60 frames per second).
  * The character's Power is now also displayed as a numeric value,
    in addition to the stars bar.
  * Fixed an unpleasant artifact in the boss background shader.
  * Fixed the "letterboxing" artifacts on some systems on non-4:3
    resolutions.
  * Updated the SDL game controller database. More gamepads are
    supported out-of-the-box now.
  * Fixed the character getting stuck moving in some direction when
    using some gamepads in the "restricted" axes mode.
  * Fixed memory corruption that could occur when a gamepad has
    fewer axes than expected of an Xbox-like controller.
