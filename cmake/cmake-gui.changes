-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul 27 17:52:16 UTC 2015 - hrvoje.senjan@gmail.com

- Update to 3.3.0:
 * New Features
  * Generators
   * The *Makefile Generators* now add ".DELETE_ON_ERROR" to the
     makefiles that contain the actual build rules for files on
     disk. This tells GNU make to remove rule outputs when their
     recipe modifies an output but fails.
   * The *Visual Studio Generators* learned to support ".xaml"
     source files and automatically associate them with corresponding
     ".h" and ".cpp" sources.
   * A new experimental "Green Hills MULTI" generator was added on
     Windows.  Green Hills MULTI is an IDE for embedded real-time
     systems.
  * Commands
   * The "add_dependencies()" command learned to allow dependencies
     to be added to *interface libraries*. Dependencies added to an
     interface library are followed transitively in its place since
     the target itself does not build.
   * The "execute_process()" command learned to support specifying
     the same file for "OUTPUT_FILE" and "ERROR_FILE".
   * The "file(GLOB)" and "file(GLOB_RECURSE)" commands learned a
     new "LIST_DIRECTORIES <bool>" option to specify whether the glob
     result
   * The "find_library()", "find_path()", and "find_file()" commands
     now search in installation prefixes derived from the "PATH"
     environment variable.
   * The "if()" command learned a new "IN_LIST" operator that
     evaluates to true if a given element is contained in a
     named list.
   * The "install(EXPORT)" and "export()" commands learned to export
     targets that populate the "INTERFACE_SOURCES" target property.
   * The "install(TARGETS)" command learned to support generator
     expressions in the "DESTINATION" value.
  * Variables
   * The version of some Fortran compilers is now detected and stored
     in the "CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER_VERSION" variable.
   * The *Visual Studio Generators* learned a new
     "CMAKE_VS_INCLUDE_INSTALL_TO_DEFAULT_BUILD" option to put the
     "INSTALL" target in the default build of a solution (".sln") file.
  * Properties
   * A "CROSSCOMPILING_EMULATOR" target property and supporting
     "CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING_EMULATOR" variable were introduced to
     allow target platform binaries to run on the host during
     cross compiling.
   * A "<LANG>_INCLUDE_WHAT_YOU_USE" target property and supporting
    "CMAKE_<LANG>_INCLUDE_WHAT_YOU_USE" variable were introduced to
    tell the *Makefile Generators* and the "Ninja" generator to run
    "include-what-you-use" along with the compiler for
    "C" and "CXX" languages.
   * The "<LANG>_VISIBILITY_PRESET" and "VISIBILITY_INLINES_HIDDEN"
     target properties now affect compilation in sources of all target
     types.  See policy "CMP0063".
   * The "XCODE_ATTRIBUTE_<an-attribute>" target property learned to
     support generator expressions.
  * Modules
   * The "CheckFortranCompilerFlag" module was introduced to check
     "Fortran" compiler flags, much like the "CheckCCompilerFlag"
     module already does for "C".
   * The "ExternalData" module learned a new
     "ExternalData_NO_SYMLINKS" option to disable use of symbolic
     links to populate the real data files and use copies instead.
   * The "ExternalData" module learned a new "RECURSE:" option in
     "DATA{}" references specifying directories. This allows an
     entire directory tree of associated files to be matched.
   * The "ExternalData" module learned a new URL template
     placeholder "%(algo:<key>)" to allow custom mapping from
     algorithm name to URL component through configuration of new
     "ExternalData_URL_ALGO_<algo>_<key>" variables. This allows
     more flexibility in remote URLs.
   * The "ExternalProject" module learned to replace tokens like
     "<BINARY_DIR>" in the "BYPRODUCTS" of each step.
   * The "ExternalProject" module APIs learned to support "generator
     expressions" when using "LOG_*" options and in CMake initial
     cache options.
   * The "FindBoost" module now tracks the directories containing
     libraries separately for RELEASE and DEBUG configurations.
   * The "FindCUDA" module now defaults to using the static CUDA
     runtime library if it is available.
     A new "CUDA_USE_STATIC_CUDA_RUNTIME" option is offered to
     control this  behavior.
   * The "FindMatlab" module was completely rewritten.  It learned
     about versions and components and to find Matlab in a more
     precise and multiplatform way.  The module now offers APIs to
     create mex extensions, documentation, and unit tests.
   * The "FindPackageHandleStandardArgs" module
     "FIND_PACKAGE_HANDLE_STANDARD_ARGS" function now always
     populates both the "<PackageName>_FOUND" and
     "<UPPERCASE_NAME>_FOUND" variables (the latter for backwards
     compatibility).  The "FOUND_VAR" option is now ignored except
     to enforce its allowed values.
   * The "InstallRequiredSystemLibraries" module learned a new
      "CMAKE_INSTALL_SYSTEM_RUNTIME_COMPONENT" option to specify the
      installation component.
  * Generator Expressions
   * A new "COMPILE_LANGUAGE" generator expression was introduced to
     allow specification of compile options for target files based
     on the "LANGUAGE" of each source file.  Due to limitations of
     the underlying native build tools, this feature has varying
     support across generators.
     See the "cmake-generator-expressions(7)" manual for details.
  * CTest
   * The "ctest(1)" tool learned a new "--repeat-until-fail <n>"
     option to help find sporadic test failures.
   * The "CTestCoverageCollectGCOV" module learned to support the
     same "CTEST_CUSTOM_COVERAGE_EXCLUDE" option as the
     "ctest_coverage()" command.
   * CPack
   * The "cpack(1)" "IFW" generator and the "CPackIFW" module
     learned to support Qt Framework Installer 2.0 tools.
   * The "CPackDeb" module learned a new
     "CPACK_DEBIAN_<COMPONENT>_PACKAGE_SHLIBDEPS" variable to
     specify per-component use of "dpkg-shlibdeps".
   * The "CPackDeb" module learned a new
     "CPACK_DEBIAN_<COMPONENT>_PACKAGE_DEPENDS" option to specify
     per-component dependencies.
   * The "CPackRPM" module learned to package symbolic links more
     cleanly and now supports directory symlinks with recent
     "rpmbuild" versions.
   * The "CPackRPM" module learned a new
     "CPACK_RPM_ADDITIONAL_MAN_DIRS" variable to specify directories
     containing man pages for the brp- compress RPM macro.
   * The "CPackRPM" module learned a new
     "CPACK_RPM_<component>_PACKAGE_ARCHITECTURE" variable to
     specify a component-specific package architecture.
   * The CPack WIX generator learned the new
     "CPACK_START_MENU_SHORTCUTS", "CPACK_DESKTOP_SHORTCUTS" and
     "CPACK_STARTUP_SHORTCUTS" installed file properties which can
     be used to install shorcuts in the Start Menu, on the Desktop
     and in the Startup Folder respectively.
   * Other
   * The "Compile Features" functionality is now aware of features
     supported by GNU compilers on Windows, versions 4.4 through 5.0.
   * The "cmake(1)" "-E tar" command learned a new "--format<format>"
     option to specify the archive format to be written.
   * On OS X, CMake learned to create XCTest bundles to test
     Frameworks and App Bundles within Xcode.  The "FindXCTest"
     module provides convenience functions to handle "XCTEST" bundles.
 * Deprecated and Removed Features
   * On OS X the "cmake-gui(1)" no longer has the "Install For Command
     Line Use" menu item.  Instead there is a "How to Install For
     Command Line Use" menu item that shows an informational dialog box
     explaining how to make the command line tools available.
     For example:
     /Applications/CMake.app/Contents/bin/cmake-gui --install
   * The "ctest_build()" and "build_command()" commands no longer
     tell "make" tools to ignore errors with the "-i" option.
     Previously this was done for *Makefile Generators* but not
     others. See policy "CMP0061".
   * The "Visual Studio 10 2010" generator no longer checks for
     running VS IDEs with the project open or asks them to reload.
     This was originally done for VS 10 because it had been done for
     VS 7 through 9 to avoid prompting for every project in a
     solution. Since VS >= 10 allow the whole solution to reload at
     once they do not need CMake to help them.
   * The "Visual Studio 7" generator (.NET 2002) is now deprecated
     and will be removed in a future version of CMake.
   * The "Visual Studio 6" generator is now deprecated and will be
     removed in a future version of CMake.
   * The "find_package()" command no longer considers project build
     trees recently configured in a "cmake-gui(1)". This was
     previously done only on Windows and is now never done. The
     "NO_CMAKE_BUILDS_PATH" option is now ignored if given and
     effectively always on. Projects may populate the *User Package
     Registry* to aid users building multiple dependent projects one
     after another.
   * When building with GNU tools on Windows (MinGW tools), the
     "find_library()" command will no longer consider ".dll" files
     to be linkable libraries.  All dynamic link libraries are
     expected to provide separate ".dll.a" or ".lib" import libraries.
   * The "add_definitions()" command no longer causes a "DEFINITIONS"
     directory property to be populated. See policy "CMP0059".
   * With Visual Studio 7, 8, and 9 generators the value of the
     "$(OutDir)" placeholder no longer evaluates to the configuration
     name.  Projects should use "$(ConfigurationName)" for that instead.
   * Using the output of "export()" with the "install(FILES)" command
     is no longer allowed.  See policy "CMP0062" for details.
 * Other Changes
   * The "Ninja" generator now requires that calls to the
     "add_custom_command()" and "add_custom_target()" commands use
     the "BYPRODUCTS" option to explicitly specify any files generated
     by the custom commands that are not listed as outputs (perhaps
     because their timestamps are allowed to be older than the inputs).
     See policy "CMP0058".
   * Build-time progress output of *Makefile Generators* has been
     improved. It no longer mixes progress and build rule messages
     during parallel builds. The link rule messages now have progress
     and are displayed as bold green instead of bold red (since red
     is often associated with an error message).
   * The "CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR" variable value for Visual Studio 7, 8,
     and 9 is now "$(ConfigurationName)" instead of "$(OutDir)".
     This should have no effect on the intended use cases of
     the variable.
   * Linking to library files by a full path in an implicit linker
     search directory (e.g. "/usr/lib/libfoo.a") no longer asks the
     linker to search for the library (e.g. "-lfoo") and now links
     by full path. See policy "CMP0060".

- Update to 3.2 rc1:
 * New Features:
   * Syntax:
     * CMake learned to support unicode characters *encoded as
       UTF-8* on Windows. This was already supported on platforms
       whose system APIs accept UTF-8 encoded strings. Unicode
       characters may now be used in CMake code, paths to source
       files, configured files such as ".h.in" files, and other
       files read and written by CMake.  Note that because CMake
       interoperates with many other tools, there may still be some
       limitations when using certain unicode characters.
   * Commands:
     * The "add_custom_command()" and "add_custom_target()"
       commands learned a new "BYPRODUCTS" option to specify files
       produced as side effects of the custom commands.
       These are not outputs because they do not always have to be
       newer than inputs.
     * The "add_custom_command()" and "add_custom_target()"
       commands learned a new "USES_TERMINAL" option to request
       that the command be given direct access to the terminal
       if possible. The "Ninja" generator will places such commands
       in the "console" "pool". Build targets provided by CMake
       that are meant for individual interactive use, such as
       "install", are now placed in this pool.
     * A new "continue()" command was added that can be called
       inside loop contexts to end the current iteration and start
       the next one at the top of the loop block.
     * The "file(LOCK)" subcommand was created to allow CMake
       processes to synchronize through file and directory locks.
     * The "file(STRINGS)" now supports UTF-16LE, UTF-16BE, UTF-32LE,
       UTF- 32BE as "ENCODING" options.
     * The "install(EXPORT)" command now works with an absolute
       "DESTINATION" even if targets in the export set are
       installed with a destination or *usage requirements*
       specified relative to the install prefix. The value of the
       "CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX" variable is hard-coded into the
       installed export file as the base for relative references.
     * The "try_compile()" command source file signature now honors
       link flags (e.g. "CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS") in the generated
       test project. See policy "CMP0056".
     * The "try_run()" command learned to honor the "LINK_LIBRARIES"
       option just as "try_compile()" already does.
     * The "file(GENERATE)" command now generates the output file
       with the same permissions as the input file if set.
     * The "file(GENERATE)" command can now generate files which
       are used as source files for buildsystem targets. Generated
       files automatically get their "GENERATED" property
       set to "TRUE".
   * Variables:
     * The "CMAKE_MATCH_COUNT" variable was introduced to record
       the number of matches made in the last regular expression
       matched in an "if()" command or a "string()" command.
   * Properties:
     * An "ANDROID_API_MIN" target property was introduced to
       specify the minimum version to be targeted by the toolchain.
     * A "VS_SHADER_FLAGS" source file property was added to
       specify additional shader flags to ".hlsl" files, for the
       Visual Studio generators.
   * Modules:
     * The "ExternalData" module learned to support *Custom Fetch
       Scripts*. This allows projects to specify custom ".cmake"
       scripts for fetching data objects during the build.
     * The "ExternalProject" module learned options to create
       independent external project step targets that do not depend
       on the builtin steps.
     * The "ExternalProject" module "ExternalProject_Add()" command
       learned a new "CMAKE_CACHE_DEFAULT_ARGS" option to initialize
       cache values in the external project without setting them on
       future builds.
     * The "ExternalProject" module "ExternalProject_Add()" command
       learned a new "TEST_EXCLUDE_FROM_MAIN" option to exclude tests
       from the main build.
     * The "ExternalProject" module "ExternalProject_Add()" command
       learned a new "UPDATE_DISCONNECTED" option to avoid
       automatically updating the source tree checkout from
       version control.
     * The "FindCUDA" module learned about the "cusolver" library
       in CUDA 7.0.
     * The "FindGit" module learned to find the "git" command-line
       tool that comes with GitHub for Windows installed in user
       home directories.
     * A "FindGSL" module was introduced to find the GNU Scientific
       Library.
     * A "FindIntl" module was introduced to find the Gettext
       "libintl" library.
     * A "FindJsonCpp" module was introduced to find the JsonCpp
       package.
     * The "FindLATEX" module learned to support components.
     * The "FindMPI" module learned to find MS-MPI on Windows.
     * The "FindOpenSSL" module now reports "crypto" and "ssl"
       libraries separately in "OPENSSL_CRYPTO_LIBRARY" and
       "OPENSSL_SSL_LIBRARY", respectively, to allow applications
       to link to one without the other.
     * The "WriteCompilerDetectionHeader" module learned to create
       a define for portability of the "cxx_thread_local" feature.
       The define expands to either the C++11 "thread_local" keyword,
       or a pre-standardization compiler-specific equivalent,
       as appropriate.
     * The "WriteCompilerDetectionHeader" module learned to create
       multiple output files per compiler and per language, instead
       of creating one large file.
   * CTest:
     * The "ctest_coverage()" command learned to support Delphi
       coverage.
     * The "ctest_coverage()" command learned to support Javascript
       coverage.
     * The "CTestCoverageCollectGCOV" module was introduced as an
       alternative to the "ctest_coverage()" command for collecting
       "gcov" results for submission to CDash.
   * CPack:
     * The "CPackRPM" module learned options to set per-component
       descriptions and summaries. See the
       "CPACK_RPM_<component>_PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION" and
       "CPACK_RPM_<component>_PACKAGE_SUMMARY" variables.
     * The "CPackRPM" module learned options to specify requirements
       for pre- and post-install scripts.
       See the "CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_REQUIRES_PRE" and
       "CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_REQUIRES_POST" variables.
     * The "CPackRPM" module learned options to specify requirements
       for pre- and post-uninstall scripts.
       See the "CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_REQUIRES_PREUN" and
       "CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_REQUIRES_POSTUN" variables.
     * The "CPackRPM" module learned a new
       "CPACK_RPM_<COMPONENT>_PACKAGE_PREFIX" variable to specify a
       component-specific value to use instead of
       "CPACK_PACKAGING_INSTALL_PREFIX".
     * The "CPackRPM" module learned a new
       "CPACK_RPM_RELOCATION_PATHS" variable to specify multiple
       relocation prefixes for a single rpm package.
   * Other:
     * The "cmake(1)" "-E tar" command now supports creating
       ".xz"-compressed archives with the "J" flag.
     * The "cmake(1)" "-E tar" command learned a new
       "--files-from=<file>" option to specify file names using
       lines in a file to overcome command-line length limits.
     * The "cmake(1)" "-E tar" command learned a new "--mtime=<date>"
       option to specify the modification time recorded in
       tarball entries.
     * The "Compile Features" functionality is now aware of features
       supported by more compilers, including:
       * Apple Clang ("AppleClang") for Xcode versions 4.4 though 6.1.
       * GNU compiler versions 4.4 through 5.0 on UNIX and Apple ("GNU").
       * Microsoft Visual Studio ("MSVC") for versions 2010 through 2015.
       * Oracle SolarisStudio ("SunPro") version 12.4.
     * The *AUTORCC* feature now tracks files listed in ".qrc" files
       as dependencies. If an input file to the "rcc" tool is changed,
       the tool is automatically re-run.
 * New Diagnostics:
     * The "break()" command now rejects calls outside of a loop
       context or that pass arguments to the command.
       See policy "CMP0055".
 * Deprecated and Removed Features:
     * Files written in the "cmake-language(7)", such as
       "CMakeLists.txt" or "*.cmake" files, are now expected to be
       encoded as UTF-8. If files are already ASCII, they will be
       compatible. If files were in a different encoding,
       including Latin 1, they will need to be converted.
     * The "FindOpenGL" module no longer explicitly searches for any
       dependency on X11 libraries with the "FindX11" module. Such
       dependencies should not need to be explicit. Applications
       using X11 APIs themselves should find and link to X11
       libraries explicitly.
     * The implementation of CMake now relies on some C++ compiler
       features which are not supported by some older compilers.
       As a result, those old compilers can no longer be used to
       build CMake itself. CMake continues to be able to generate
       Makefiles and project files for users of those old compilers
       however. Compilers known to no longer be capable of building
       CMake are:
       * Visual Studio 6 and 7.0 -- superseded by VisualStudio 7.1
         and newer.
       * GCC 2.95 -- superseded by GCC 3 and newer compilers.
       * Borland compilers -- superseded by other Windows compilers.
       * Compaq compilers -- superseded by other compilers.
       * SGI compilers -- IRIX was dropped as a host platform.
 * Other Changes:
     * On Windows and OS X, commands supporting network communication
       via "https", such as "file(DOWNLOAD)", "file(UPLOAD)", and
       "ctest_submit()", now support SSL/TLS even when CMake is not
       built against OpenSSL. The Windows or OS X native SSL/TLS
       implementation is used by default. OS-configured certificate
       authorities will be trusted automatically.
       On other platforms, when CMake is built with OpenSSL,
       these commands now search for OS-configured certificate
       authorities in a few "/etc" paths to be trusted automatically.
     * On OS X with Makefile and Ninja generators, when a compiler
       is found in "/usr/bin" it is now mapped to the corresponding
       compiler inside the Xcode application folder, if any. This
       allows such build trees to continue to work with their
       original compiler even when "xcode- select" switches to a
       different Xcode installation.
     * The Visual Studio generators now write solution and project
       files in UTF-8 instead of Windows-1252. Windows-1252
       supported Latin 1 languages such as those found in North
       and South America and Western Europe. With UTF-8, additional
       languages are now supported.
     * The "Xcode" generator no longer requires a value for the
       "CMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM" variable to be located up front. It now
       locates "xcodebuild" when needed at build time.
     * When building CMake itself using SolarisStudio 12, the
       default "libCStd" standard library is not sufficient to
       build CMake. The SolarisStudio distribution supports compiler
       options to use "STLPort4" or "libstdc++". An appropriate
       option to select the standard library is now added
       automatically when building CMake with SolarisStudio compilers.

  openSUSE > 13.2
- Added form.patch: set the correct include path for the
  ncurses includes

Tue Oct 28 20:09:36 UTC 2014 - hrvoje.senjan@gmail.com

- Update to 3.1.0~rc1
 * Some of the more significant features of CMake 3.1 are:
   * Windows Phone and Windows Store support has been added to
     Visual Studio 11 (2012) and above Generators.
   * NVIDIA Nsight Tegra support has been added to  Visual Studio
     10 (2010) and above Generators.
   * New "target_compile_features" command allows populating
     target based compile features. CMake uses this information
     to ensure that the compiler in use is capable of building the
     target, and to add any necessary compile flags such as
     -std=gnu++11 to support language features.
     More information on this is found at:
     http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.1/manual/cmake-compile-features.7.html
   * The syntax for *Variable References* and *Escape Sequences* was simplified in
  order to allow a much faster implementation. See policy "CMP0053".
   * The "if" command no longer automatically dereferences
     variables named in quoted or bracket arguments.  See policy "CMP0054".
   * The target property "SOURCES" now generally supports "Generator
     Expressions". The generator expressions may be used in the
     "add_library" and "add_executable" commands.
   * It is now possible to write and append to the target
     property "SOURCES". The variable "CMAKE_DEBUG_TARGET_PROPERTIES"
     can be used to trace the origin of sources.
   * CPack gained "7Z" and "TXZ" generators supporting
     lzma-compressed archives.
   * The ExternalProject module has learned to support lzma-compressed
     source tarballs with ".7z", ".tar.xz", and ".txz" extensions.
   * The ExternalProject module ExternalProject_Add command
     learned a new BUILD_ALWAYS option to cause the external project
     build step to run every time the host project is built.
   * The ctest_coverage command learned to support Intel coverage
     files with the "codecov" tool.
   * The ctest_memcheck command learned to support sanitizer modes,
     including "AddressSanitizer", "MemorySanitizer", "ThreadSanitizer",
     and "UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer".
 * Deprecated and Removed Features:
   * In CMake 3.0 the "target_link_libraries" command accidentally
     began allowing unquoted arguments to use Generator Expressions
     containing a semicolon separated list within them.
     CMake 3.1 again requires the quotes for this to work correctly.
