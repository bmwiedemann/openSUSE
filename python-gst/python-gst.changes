- Update to version 1.16.0:
  + Highlights:
    - GStreamer WebRTC stack gained support for data channels for
      peer-to-peer communication based on SCTP, BUNDLE support,
      as well as support for multiple TURN servers.
    - AV1 video codec support for Matroska and QuickTime/MP4
      containers and more configuration options and supported
      input formats for the AOMedia AV1 encoder
    - Support for Closed Captions and other Ancillary Data in video
   -  Support for planar (non-interleaved) raw audio
    - GstVideoAggregator, compositor and OpenGL mixer elements are
      now in -base
    - New alternate fields interlace mode where each buffer carries
      a single field
    - WebM and Matroska ContentEncryption support in the Matroska
      demuxer
    - new WebKit WPE-based web browser source element
    - Video4Linux: HEVC encoding and decoding, JPEG encoding, and
      improved dmabuf import/export
    - Hardware-accelerated Nvidia video decoder gained support for
      VP8/VP9 decoding, whilst the encoder gained support for
      H.265/HEVC encoding.
    - Many improvements to the Intel Media SDK based
      hardware-accelerated video decoder and encoder plugin
      (msdk): dmabuf import/export for zero-copy integration with
      other components; VP9 decoding; 10-bit HEVC encoding; video
      post-processing (vpp) support including deinterlacing; and
      the video decoder now handles dynamic resolution changes.
    - The ASS/SSA subtitle overlay renderer can now handle multiple
      subtitles that overlap in time and will show them on screen
      simultaneously
    - The Meson build is now feature-complete (*) and it is now the
      recommended build system on all platforms. The Autotools
      build is scheduled to be removed in the next cycle.
    - The GStreamer Rust bindings and Rust plugins module are now
      officially part of upstream GStreamer.
    - The GStreamer Editing Services gained a gesdemux element
      that allows directly playing back serialized edit list with
      playbin or (uri)decodebin
    - Many performance improvements.
