- Add patch to fix build with Qt 5.15:
  * 0001-Fix-build-with-Qt-5.15.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan 28 13:25:18 UTC 2020 - Christophe Giboudeaux <christophe@krop.fr>

- Update to 4.0.1
  * Fix the vertical scale in NoteLayer when displaying a model
    with non-Hz scale
  * Fix failure to make installed executables executable when
   compiling and installing the source package
- Remove conditions for unmaintained openSUSE versions.
- Don't use -Werror.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct 31 19:43:38 UTC 2019 - Edgar Aichinger <edogawa@aon.at>

- Update to version 4.0
 * Add Box annotation layer type, typically used for time-frequency boxes 
   to be annotated over a spectrogram. Because this introduces a new layer 
   type into the session file format, the major version number has been 
   bumped to v4.0. Sessions saved from v4.0 can still be opened in earlier 
   versions of Sonic Visualiser, but any Box layers will not be loaded
 * Fix behaviour of auto-align layers on top of waveform: they can now be 
   aligned in the vertical scale, if they have a unit of V and the waveform 
   is of a single channel in linear or dB mode
 * Make the UI more readable in macOS "dark mode"
 * Fix sluggishness in starting and stopping playback when using PulseAudio
   v13.0+
 Changes in version 3.3
 * Add support for reading the Opus audio codec on all platforms
 * Add support for WMA and AAC formats on 64-bit Windows. (AAC was already 
   supported on macOS.) Note that AAC support on Windows does not support 
   "gapless" import, i.e. removing the encoder gaps at start and end of 
   the stream
 * Add ability to choose the field separator when importing CSV and 
   CSV-like files, if more than one possible candidate separator is 
   found in the file
 * Fix crash when closing session or starting a new session while 
   calculating alignment of multiple audio files
 * Fix crash when running certain plugins that call for frequency-domain 
   input at non-power-of-two block sizes
 * Fix wandering left edge of measure-tool rectangle while dragging out 
   the area
 * Ensure that plugin stderr debug output is logged to the SV log file
 
- Refreshed sonic-visualiser-system-dataquay.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan 30 07:02:28 UTC 2019 - Konstantin Voinov <kill_it@mail.ru>

- Update to version 3.2.1
 * Fix failure to record from built-in microphone on macOS 10.14
   (caused by lack of microphone permission request text)
 * Fix crash when closing SV or starting a new session during recording
 * Fix crash on exit in some builds that disable OSC support
 * Fix flashing effect when scrolling certain configurations of colour 3d
   plot layer leftwards
 Changes in version 3.2
 * Add ability to zoom closer than one sample per pixel, so as to see
   the interpolated signal level between samples
 * Add oversampling control to the spectrogram and spectrum layers
 * Highlight and label frequency peaks in the spectrum as the mouse
   rolls over them, when enabled in the parameter area
 * Add feature to convert and import audio from a CSV data file
 * Add some new colour maps, and restore the old Blue on Black one
 * Speed up spectrum rendering at high resolutions
 * Fix failure to pass Nyquist bins correctly to
   frequency-domain-input Vamp plugins in some circumstances
 * Fix sometimes incorrect shortcut associations for new-layer menu
   items
 * Various other rendering improvements and bug fixes

- Refreshed sonic-visualiser-system-dataquay.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct 26 18:31:18 UTC 2018 - Wolfgang Bauer <wbauer@tmo.at>

- Use gcc7 on Leap 42.3 to fix build

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct 12 09:10:00 UTC 2018 - Luigi Baldoni <aloisio@gmx.com>

- Update to version 3.1.1
  * Fix failure to record correctly into an empty session with
    certain audio drivers
  * Fix failure to run LADSPA plugins at all, except with some
    unusual path layouts
  * Fix failure to silence sonified notes when rewinding backwards
    or jumping back from a loop endpoint

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug  6 13:37:09 UTC 2018 - aloisio@gmx.com

- Fixed the tests and dropped
  sonic-visualiser-remove-svcore-test.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul 17 14:59:23 UTC 2018 - aloisio@gmx.com

- Update to version 3.1
  * Add Plugins tab to Preferences dialog, from which you can
    review the plugin load paths and see which plugins were
    loaded from which locations, and also customise load paths
    (though the various path environment variables are still
    supported)
  * Stream the export of audio data and other CSV data so that
    very large exports don't hang the UI or run us out of memory
    (thanks to Lucas Thompson)
  * Ensure vertical scale appears for auto-align layers when
    there is nothing else to auto-align them to
  * Fix another long-standing Windows-platform wide-char/utf8
    conversion problem, with environment variable naming and
    contents
  * Improve handling of incomplete session loads, i.e.
    situations where the audio files referred to by a session
    could not be found - previously the session could be re-saved
    immediately thus losing the audio reference; now at least we
    disable Save (enabling only Save As) and show a warning
  * Update pane and layer menu shortcuts so that the
    waveform/spectrogram/etc shortcuts (Shift+G etc) operate on
    the source model in the currently-selected pane rather than
    the main model. This is a backward-incompatible change but is
    a far more intuitive way for the function to work
  * Use dark background for bright colours in time-value/note/etc
    layers as well as e.g. waveforms - this is how it was always
    "intended to" work, but it is a backward-incompatible change
  * Make "Select All" select the whole span of everything that
    exists, not just the main model
  * Add horizontal scale to Spectrum layer
  * Improve spacing and labelling of vertical log scales
  * Update build system for better Cap'n Proto version support
    and to use Repoint for code management in the repository
  * Various other bug fixes

- Dropped piper.capnp (fixed upstream)

- Refreshed sonic-visualiser-remove-svcore-test.patch

- Added sonic-visualiser-system-dataquay.patch

- Spec cleanup

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 14 05:53:39 UTC 2017 - aloisio@gmx.com

- Build against dataquay also in Tumbleweed

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 28 17:14:37 UTC 2017 - aloisio@gmx.com

- Update to version 3.0.3
  * Improve decisions about where and how to label vertical scales
  * Update build support material and documentation to reflect the
    official release of Cap'n Proto 0.6 (which we can now use rather
    than depending on git builds)
  version 3.0.2:
  * Fix crash when changing parameters for spectrum view
  * Fix incorrect measure tool crosshairs in spectrum view
  * Update Russian and Czech UI translations (thanks to Alexandre
    Prokoudine and Pavel Fric respectively)
  version 3.0.1:
  * Update MIDI input driver layer
  version 3.0:
  * Add ability to record audio, and ability to change the audio
    device for playback or recording in the preferences
  * Add complete support for high-resolution (Hi-DPI or retina)
    displays, including for layer data rendering as well as UI
    controls and icons. This makes the biggest difference when using
    a retina Mac, on which previous versions did not render layer
    data at retina resolution, but it also improves scaling and
    rendering of UI elements on Hi-DPI displays on Windows and Linux
  * Add ability to export scalable (SVG) image files
  * Run plugins in a separate process, so that if a plugin crashes,
    it no longer brings down Sonic Visualiser with it. In every other
    respect the behaviour should be unchanged
  * Scan plugins on startup in a separate process, and report on any
    that crash or won't load
  * Add ability to open, display, and analyse very long audio files
    (of more than 2^32 sample frames)
  * Change mp3 file loading so as to compensate for encoder/decoder
    delay and padding (using "gapless playback" logic). While this
    is a real improvement, unfortunately it does mean that the
    initial padding in mp3 file load has changed from previous
    versions, which may mean some sessions saved in previous versions
    are no longer correctly aligned. It's not a great idea to use mp3
    as a file format of record, because of differences like this
    between decoders. The previous behaviour is still available as a
    preference.
  * Add new Hybrid normalisation type for spectrogram and colour 3d
    plot layers. This normalises each column to its peak value and
    then scales the normalised values by the log of the peak in order
    to restore some distinction in scale between columns with
    different levels. It can provide quite visually clear results.
  * Add function to subdivide time instant layers into regular
    intervals (and its inverse)
  * Add new preference for default colour scales
  * Add a basic ability to zoom (in the frequency axis) to the
    spectrum
  * Switch to using combined level/pan controls in layer property
    boxes and for the main volume control
  * Make CSV file reader better able to handle files with varying
    numbers of columns
  * Add "What's New" dialog

- Dropped sonic-visualiser-ld-X11-fix.patch and refreshed
  sonic-visualiser-remove-svcore-test.patch

- Added piper.capnp schema to generate sources without the
  hardcoded capnp 0.6.0

- Dropped sonic-visualiser.desktop

- Added fishsound requirement

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug 25 06:10:58 UTC 2017 - olaf@aepfle.de

- Remove mad conditional because it is always present

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jan  7 16:00:06 UTC 2017 - aloisio@gmx.com

- Update to version 2.5
  * Add unit-converter dialog, for converting between various 
    pitch and timing units
  * Fix failure to reload note layers from session file
  * Use a more sensible scale for the play-speed dial
  * Fix crash when importing very wide CSV files
  * Fix generation of wrong layer type from some CSV files
  * Fix failure to export last instant in a time-instant layer
  version 2.4:
  * Fix a crash when rendering certain colour 3d plot layers
  version 2.3:
  * Add support for left/right scrolling using a two-finger 
    touchpad gesture (where available)
  * Make the octave numbering into a configurable option, and 
    change the default. Previously Sonic Visualiser labelled 
    middle-C as "C3"; now it labels middle-C as "C4", a more
    common standard in the world outside MIDI sequencer
    software. The previous system is available as an option
    in the Preferences. This affects only the visible
    labels: there is no change to analysis or to the file 
    format
  * Sonify time-value layers. Any time-value curve whose scale 
    unit is set to Hz will now acquire a playback toggle
    control; this control is off by default, but if it is
    switched on, the curve will be played back using a
    variable-frequency sound generator
  * Add support for playback of note layers with non-MIDI 
    frequencies (formerly the note playback was limited to
    exact MIDI pitch)
  * Change the default playback sample for note layers from 
    piano to an electric piano with sustain. The piano sample
    is still available, and any sessions saved using it should
    continue to use it
  * Add a cancel button for Vamp plugin processing: currently,
    cancelling a transform results in a part-complete layer 
    rather than removing the results
  * Add keyboard shortcuts to cycle the current layer (in 
    addition to the existing ones to cycle the current pane)
  * Fix various bugs related to layer ordering: layer tabs 
    re-ordering themselves randomly when new layer added,
    layers being ordered randomly when saving and reloading
    a session
  * Fix incorrect interaction with non-Unicode usernames when 
    creating temporary and template directories on Windows
  * Shade the start and end of the main audio file, to make 
    them easier to see for files that start or end in silence
  * Speed up rendering and scrolling in time-value layers
  * Make it possible to import CSV files directly into Note 
    layers by adding Pitch as a data type in the CSV file
    import dialog
  * Fix play pointer jump to wrong frame when clicking on row 
    in the layer edit dialog
  * Fix problems with keyboard shortcuts when using Qt5 on 
    OS/X. This is the first release in which the official
    builds use Qt5 for all platforms.
  version 2.2:
  * Add a startup welcome dialog that also explains what SV 
    makes network connections for and allows user to forbid
    them
  * Add "Export Audio Data" feature
  * Show piano keyboard scale in note and time-value layers as 
    well as spectrogram, where vertical scale is log Hz; also
    show numerical scale in note and region layers when not 
    auto-aligned
  * Speed up CSV file import and avoid showing crazily wide 
    window for CSV file format dialog when file has lots of
    columns
  * Fix incorrectly saved window geometry when exiting from 
    maximised state
  * Reduce number of timer wakeups when idle
  * Add American English translation and make choice of 
    translation into a preference (defaulting to system locale)
  * Permit installation to non-default location with Windows 
    installer build
  version 2.1:
  * Build with support for hidpi ("retina") text on OS/X
  * Fix very slow analysis when using Ogg or FLAC files decoded
    via libsndfile
  * Fix inaccurate scale auto-align between time-value layers 
    and others
  * Fix failure to open files specified on command line (or via
    Open With) on Windows
  * Reset cyclical counters and switch back to navigate mode 
    when a new session is started
  version 2.0.1:
  * Fix incorrect handling of FixedSampleRate outputs (Vamp 
    SDK fix)
  * Make it easier to see results from transforms that return 
    a single point
  * Make labelling clearer on time-value layers
  * Add discrete-curve mode for time-value layers (for curves 
    with gaps)
  * Update code to build against Qt5
  version  2.0:
  * Fix incorrect samplerate in reading m4a files on OS/X
  version 1.9:
  * Support 64-bit builds on OS/X (using CoreAudio instead of
    obsolete QuickTime audio file reader)
  * Simplify RDF reading and fix some bugs. Now requires 
    Dataquay (http://breakfastquay.com/dataquay/) rather than
    using Redland directly. Release builds use Sord/Serd rather
    than Redland
  * Add a fullscreen mode on the F11 key
