- Update to version 0.923:
  * A new function "rearrange_and_copy()" was added to the tensor
    and tensor_grid classes for several kinds of tensor
    rearrangements.
  * A new matrix_view_transpose class and a new wordexp() function
    were created.
  * The classes cloud_file, boson_rel, eos_had_skyrme,
    eos_tov_buchdahl, fermion_deriv_rel, fermion_eff,
    fermion_nonrel, fermion_rel, eos_had_rmf, hist, interpm_krige,
    and interp_krige_optim classes were improved improved. The
    particle calibration routines were improved.
  * The constants were updated for the CODATA 2014 release.
  * Several updates were made to acol. The handling of tensor and
    tensor_grid classes was improved. Vector and value
    specifications were added. The help text was reworked. The
    autocorr command was improved.
  * A new class slack_messenger was created to send messages to
    Slack.
- Drop o2scl-remove-glob_wrapper-test.patch: incorporated
  upstream.

- Update to version 0.922:
  * In the table class, the set() function no longer automatically
    adds rows or columns. This prevents some behavior which was
    not intuitive for users.
  * Several tensor functions have been added, including
    tensor::swap_data(), tensor_out(), tensor::min(),
    tensor::max(), tensor::copy(), tensor::is_valid().
  * Slicing for tensor_grid objects has been improved.
  * Copy constructors for tensor and tensor_grid have been
    created.
  * A few long double integration classes have been added when
    higher accuracy is required.
  * The MCMC classes have been completely reworked, offering
    better support for OpenMP and MPI parallelism.
  * The acol command has been expanded and improved in several
    ways. Code for o2graph has been moved out and the
    documentation has been improved.
  * The conversion functions in convert_units now has a const
    version
  * The documentation has been improved everywhere.
  * A new nearest neighbor interpolation type has been added.
  * A seed bug in rng_gsl has been fixed.
  * HDF5 I/0 for table3d types now allows const references.
  * The cloud_file class is updated and simplified.
  * The prob_dens_func_amr class has been updated.
  * Some work has been done on heat capacity functions for
    particle objects.
  * The fermion_rel::calc_mu() and pair_mu() functions work better
    now with bad initial guesses.
  * The tov_solve, eos_tov, eos_cs2_const, and eos_had_rmf_hyp
    classes are improved.
- Drop o2scl-decrease-fit_fix-tolerances.patch: upstreamed.
- Add o2scl-remove-glob_wrapper-test.patch: Remove glob_wrapper()
  from misc_ts because it isn't platform independent; patch taken
  from upstream git (gh#awsteiner/o2scl#8).

Tue Apr 24 11:59:26 UTC 2018 - guillaume.gardet@opensuse.org

- Enable test only on x86_64 since all other archs do not support 
  low tolerances

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 27 15:09:27 UTC 2018 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Disable tests on i586 until test codes are fixed, typically
  simply by increasing tolerances (gh#awsteiner/o2scl#7).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar  6 17:09:20 UTC 2018 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Add o2scl-decrease-fit_fix-tolerances.patch: Decrease the
  tolerance level on fit_fix test to prevent errors on 32-bit
  systems during make check; patch taken from upstream git
  (gh#awsteiner/o2scl#7).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar  6 15:20:58 UTC 2018 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Only enable gsl2 features for openSUSE >= 1500; gsl >= 2.0 is
  not available for older openSUSE.

- Update to version 0.921:
  * New vector_autocorr() functions were created to analyze
    autocorrelations.
  * The class serach_vec now has improved thread safety.
  * Kriging classes interpm_krige_nn, interpm_krige, and
    interp_krige were created. These are still a bit experimental.
  * A new Robbins-Monro iteration root-finding class has been
    created. A class smooth_func for smoothing multivariate
    functions by averaging in a neighborhood has been created.
    These should help dealing with noisy functions.
  * All 'funct11' classes have been renamed to 'funct'.
  * New vector bin size functions have been created.
  * The 'acol' command has been reworked to handle HDF5 I/O for
    more types. It can now manipulate vectors, matrices, and
    tensors in several new ways. The interaction with o2graph in
    o2sclpy has also been improved.
  * The Markov chain Monte Carlo classes have been updated, but
    are still experimental. Similarly with the probability
    density distribution classes where new bivariate gaussian
    and AMR-like probability densities were created.
  * The internal bibliography mechanics have been improved.
  * Error handling in nucleus_rmf has been improved.
  * Updates to eos_tov_vectors, eos_had_rmf, eos_tov_vectors,
    eos_had_skyrme.
  * Created an eos_cs2_poly class and anneal_para_ts.
  * Nuclear masses were updated for the 2016 AME data set.
  * The calculation of dndT, dndmu, and dsdT for relativistic
    fermions has been improved.
  * The SFHo and SFHx EOSs were updated.
  * Several internal changes have been made to allow Ubuntu-style
    packages. The 'make check' target now works without 'make
    install'. A snapcraft snap has also been created. These are
    still in progress.
- Run tests in a check section.
- Remove bogus duplicated doc files from non-std location
  [/usr/search].
