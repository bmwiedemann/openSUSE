- Update to version 2.12.2
  * Improve pull-request push target detection for git config
    push.default is "upstream", but when the current branch does
    not have upstream configuration
- Update to version 2.12.1
  Fixes:
  * hub pull-request: Avoid crash when the current branch is pushed
    to a non-GitHub remote BROWSER environment variable now supports
    values with spaces in them (must be shell-quoted)
  * hub help: support man appearing in a path that has spaces
  * Docs: mention that comma-separated lists must not have spaces
- Update to version 2.12.0
  * Add hub api --paginate option to automatically fetch all pages
    of results

    project maintainers being able to push to your branch

    current branch wasn't pushed to a git remote hub issue -M now
    accepts milestone names instead of just numbers
  * Drop support for legacy hub.http-clone git config value (this
    was broken for a while and nobody complained, so I deemed it
    safe to drop in a minor rather than a major release)
  Fixes
  * Fix querying git configuration when GIT_TRACE is used
  * Support detached HEAD if hub pull-request --head was passed
  * Fix newline in hub create error message

  * Fix non-draft pull requests for certain repositories
- Update to version 2.11.0

    Draft pull requests are considered work in progress: they don't
    automatically request others for review and they are not
    mergeable while in their draft state.
