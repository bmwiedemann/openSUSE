- Fix build without python2

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 30 09:38:31 UTC 2020 - Marketa Calabkova <mcalabkova@suse.com>

- Update to 8.1
  * Make it possible to opt out of the output capturing that
    :func:`humanfriendly.testing.run_cli()` sets up by default.
  * Improve feature parity between :class:`humanfriendly.testing.CaptureOutput`
    and my :pypi:`capturer` package to the point where most of the
    :pypi:`humanfriendly` test suite can now run without :pypi:`capturer`.
  * Refactored the test suite to import all names separately instead of referring
    to identifiers via their modules (my preferences have changed since this code
    was written a long time ago).
  * Adopt :func:`functools.wraps()` to make decorator functions more robust.
  * Make the :class:`~humanfriendly.terminal.spinners.Spinner` class more
    customizable. The interval at which spinners are updated and the characters
    used to draw the animation of spinners can now be customized by callers.
    This was triggered by `executor issue #2`_.
  * Improve test skipping based on exception types.
  * The "deprecated imports" feature provided by :mod:`humanfriendly.deprecation`
    has been adopted to clean up the maze of (almost but not quite) cyclic import
    dependencies between modules.
  * HTML to ANSI functionality has been extracted to a new
    :mod:`humanfriendly.terminal.html` module.
  * Support for spinners has been extracted to a new
    :mod:`humanfriendly.terminal.spinners` module.
  * The use of positional arguments to initialize
    :class:`~humanfriendly.terminal.spinners.Spinner` objects has been deprecated
    using the new :func:`humanfriendly.deprecation.deprecated_args()` decorator
    function.
  * Added the :func:`humanfriendly.deprecation.deprecated_args()` decorator function
    which makes it easy to switch from positional arguments to keyword arguments
    without dropping backwards compatibility.
  * Accept pluralized disk size units (`#26`_). I'm not claiming this is a full
    solution to the problem, far from it. It does lessen the pain a bit (IMHO).
  * Make sure the selected pager is available before trying to run it. While
    testing :pypi:`humanfriendly` on Windows 10 I noticed that ``humanfriendly
    *-help`` resulted in nothing but a traceback, because :man:`less` wasn't
    available. That's not human friendly at all 😕 (even if it is Windows 😈).
  * Merge pull request `#24`_: Fix bug in :func:`~humanfriendly.parse_length()` that rounded floats.
  * Merge pull request `#32`_: Update hyperlinks in readme.
  * Merge pull request `#33`_: Drop support for Python 2.6 and 3.0-3.4
  * Merge pull request `#35`_: SVG badge in readme.
  * Merge pull request `#36`_: Add support for nanoseconds and microseconds time units
  * Fixed :func:`~humanfriendly.tables.format_rst_table()` omission from
    ``humanfriendly.tables.__all__``.
  * Start testing on Python 3.8 and 3.9-dev.
  * Emit an ANSI reset code when :func:`humanfriendly.terminal.html.HTMLConverter.close()`
  * Added the :func:`humanfriendly.terminal.html_to_ansi()` function which is a
  * Added ``humanfriendly.testing.TestCase.assertRaises()`` enhancements.
  * Define ``humanfriendly.text.__all__``.

Sat Feb 15 08:48:24 CET 2020 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Update to 6.1:
  - Added a :pypy:`...` role for easy linking to packages on the
    Python Package Index, for details refer to
    :func:`humanfriendly.sphinx.pypi_role()`.
  - Wasted quite a bit of time debugging a MacOS failure on
    Travis CI caused by a broken man`pip` installation, fixed by
    using get-pip.py to bootstrap an installation that actually
    works wink.
  - Enable :class:`~humanfriendly.testing.MockedProgram` to
    customize the shell script code of mocked programs. This was
    added to make it easy to mock a program that is expected to
    generate specific output (I'm planning to use this in the
    :pypi:`linux-utils` test suite).
  - Defined __all__ for all public modules that previously lacked
    "export control" and decided to bump the major version number
    as a precaution:
    - These changes should not have any impact on backwards
      compatibility, unless I forgot entries, in which case
      callers can get :exc:`~exceptions.ImportError`
      exceptions...
    - Imports of public modules were previously exported
      (implicitly) and this pollutes code completion suggestions
      which in turn can encourage bad practices (not importing
      things using their "canonical" name).
    - I started developing the humanfriendly package years before
      I learned about the value of defining __all__ and so some
      modules lacked a definition until now. I decided that now
      was as good a time as any to add those definitions
      innocent.
  - Simplified the headings in docs/api.rst so that only the
    module names remain. This was done because Sphinx doesn't
    support nested links in HTML output and thus generated really
    weird "Table of Contents" listings.
  - Fixed the reStructuredText references in the documentation of
    :func:`~humanfriendly.prompts.prompt_for_choice()`. This
    function is imported from :mod:`humanfriendly.prompts` to
    :mod:`humanfriendly` (for backwards compatibility) where it
    can't use relative references to refer to the other functions
    in the :mod:`humanfriendly.prompts` module.
  - Embedded quite a few Python API references into recent
    changelog entries, just because I could (I heart what
    hyperlinks can do for the usability of technical
    documentation, it gives a lot more context).
  - Added custom :man:`...` role for easy linking to Linux manual
    pages to the :mod:`humanfriendly.sphinx` module.
  - Changed rendering of pretty tables to expand tab characters
    to spaces: Until now pretty tables did not take the variable
    width of tab characters into account which resulted in tables
    whose "line drawing characters" were visually misaligned.
    Tabs are now expanded to spaces using str.expandtabs().
  - Stop testing on Python 2.6 and drop official support. The
    world (including Travis CI) has moved on and preserving
    Python 2.6 compatibility was clearly starting to drag the
    project down...
  - I decided to bump the major version number because each of
    these changes can be considered backwards incompatible in one
    way or another and version numbers are cheap anyway so there
    stuck_out_tongue.

  * Emit vertical whitespace for block tags like <div>, <p> and <pre> and post-process the generated output in __call__() to compact empty lines.
  * Don’t pre-process preformatted text using the user defined text callback.
  * Improve robustness against malformed HTML (previously an IndexError would be raised when a closing </a> tag was encountered without a corresponding opening <a> tag).
  * Emit an ANSI reset code when HTMLConverter.close() is called and a style is still active (improves robustness against malformed HTML).
  * Support for 24-bit (RGB) terminal colors. Works by accepting a tuple or list with three integers representing an RGB (red, green, blue) color.
  * Support for italic text rendering on the terminal.
  * Make format_timespan() accept datetime.timedelta objects (fixes #27).
  * Add license key to setup.py script (pointed out to me in coloredlogs pull request #53).
  * Added the Timer.sleep() method to sleep “no more than” the given number of seconds.

- Update to official release 1.44.7

Minor improvements to usage message reformatting

Remove undocumented .strip() from join_lines()
Why I noticed this: It has the potential to eat significant white
space in usage messages that are marked up in reStructuredText syntax.

Why I decided to change it: The behavior isn't documented and on
second thought I wouldn't expect a function called join_lines()
to strip any and all leading/trailing white space.

Improve usage message parsing algorithm (also add a proper test)
Refer to test_parse_usage_tricky() for an example of a usage message that
is now parsed correctly but would previously confuse the dumb "parsing"
algorithm in parse_usage().

Make usage message parsing a bit more strict
Admittedly this needs a lot more love to make it more robust but
I lack the time to implement this at the moment. Some day soon! :-)

Unbreak conditional importlib dependency*
* https://travis-ci.org/xolox/python-humanfriendly/builds/110585766

  Kind of strange that everything worked fine locally. Then again,
  I've never used wheel compatible conditional dependencies before
  so of course my first attempt was bound to fail in same way :-s.

Make conditional importlib dependency compatible with wheels*
While running tox tests of another project of mine that uses the
humanfriendly package I noticed a traceback when importing the
humanfriendly package (because importlib was missing). After some
digging I found that tox uses pip to install packages and pip converts
source distributions to wheel distributions before/during installation,
thereby dropping the conditional importlib dependency.

Fix non-fatal log format error in prompt_for_choice()

Add humanfriendly.sphinx module
