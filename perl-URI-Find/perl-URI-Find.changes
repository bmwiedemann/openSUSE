- updated to 20140709
     New Features
     * The "git" scheme is supported. (Schwern)
     * svn, ssh and svn+ssh schemes are supported. [rt.cpan.org 57490] (Schwern)
     * Added a --schemeless option to urifind. (Schwern)
 
     Bug Fixes
     * http:// is no longer matched [rt.cpan.org 63283] (Schwern)
 
     Backwards Incompatibilities
     * Previously, URIs stringified to their canonical version.  Now
       they stringify as written.  This results in less loss of
       information.  For example.  "Blah HTTP:://FOO.COM" previously
       would stringify as "http://foo.com/" and now it will stringify
       as "HTTP://FOO.COM".  To restore the old behavior you can call
       $uri->canonical. (Schwern)
 
     Distribution Changes
     * No longer using URI::URL. (Schwern)
     * Now requires URI 1.60 for Unicode support. (Schwern)

     Bug Fixes
     * Handle balanced [], {} and quotes in addition to (). [rt.cpan.org 85053] (Schwern)
     * Don't mangle IPv6 URLs. [rt.cpan.org 85053] (Schwern)
     * Schemeless is more accurate about two letter TLDs. [github 3] (GwenDragon)
 
     Distribution Changes
