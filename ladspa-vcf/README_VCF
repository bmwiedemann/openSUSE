vcf.so and vcf_cv_in.so implement plugins for audio EQ biquad filters
based on the cookbook formulae by Robert Bristow-Johnson:
http://www.harmony-central.com/Computer/Programming/Audio-EQ-Cookbook.txt

vcf.so has audio rate ports for signal i/o.
vcf_cv_in.so has additional audio rate inputs for time dependent control of 
filter parameters. The Frequency Input is linear between 0..1, where 1
corresponds to 20000 Hz. The input signal is added to the Frequency Offset
parameter.
