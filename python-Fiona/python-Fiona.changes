- Split executable into own module to avoid conflicts with fio.
  fio is a Linux Kernel project so we probably don't want to make
  fiona conflict with it completely.

- Update to last version 1.8.6
  * The advertisement for JSON driver enablement in 1.8.5 was false (#176), but
    in this release they are ready for use.
- Update to last version 1.8.5
  * GDAL seems to work best if GDAL_DATA is set as early as possible. Ideally it
    is set when building the library or in the environment before importing
    Fiona, but for wheels we patch GDAL_DATA into os.environ when fiona.env
    is imported. This resolves #731.
  * A combination of bugs which allowed .cpg files to be overlooked has been
    fixed (#726).
  * On entering a collection context (Collection.__enter__) a new anonymous GDAL
    environment is created if needed and entered. This makes `with
    fiona.open(...) as collection:` roughly equivalent to `with fiona.open(...)
    as collection, Env():`. This helps prevent bugs when Collections are created
    and then used later or in different scopes.
  * Missing GDAL support for TopoJSON, GeoJSONSeq, and ESRIJSON has been enabled
    (#721).
  * A regression in handling of polygons with M values (#724) has been fixed.
  * Per-feature debug logging calls in OGRFeatureBuilder methods have been
    eliminated to improve feature writing performance (#718).
  * Native support for datasets in Google Cloud Storage identified by "gs"
    resource names has been added (#709).
  * Support has been added for triangle, polyhedral surface, and TIN geometry
    types (#679).
  * Notes about using the MemoryFile and ZipMemoryFile classes has been added to
    the manual (#674).

- Update to last version 1.8.4
  + There are no known breaking changes in 1.8.0. Python warnings 
    should be expected in several cases of class and method 
    deprecation.
  + The fiona.drivers() context manager is being replaced by 
    fiona.Env(), which also registers format drivers and has the 
    same properties as the GDAL configuration manager in Rasterio.
  + Collection slicing will be disallowed in a future version of 
    Fiona to remove the confusion between mapping and list semantics
    for Collection objects. Code such as 
    fiona.open(“example.shp”)[1:10] 
    should be changed to list(fiona.open(“example.shp”))[1:10].
- Packaging: Minimal spec-cleaner
  + Remove unneeded requires: python
