%description
Minion is a high performance job queue for the Perl programming language,
with support for multiple named queues, priorities, high priority fast
lane, delayed jobs, job dependencies, job progress, job results, retries
with backoff, rate limiting, unique jobs, expiring jobs, statistics,
distributed workers, parallel processing, autoscaling, remote control, at
https://mojolicious.org admin ui, resource leak protection and multiple
backends (such as at https://www.postgresql.org).

Job queues allow you to process time and/or computationally intensive tasks
in background processes, outside of the request/response lifecycle of web
applications. Among those tasks you'll commonly find image resizing, spam
filtering, HTTP downloads, building tarballs, warming caches and basically
everything else you can imagine that's not super fast.

Take a look at our excellent documentation in Minion::Guide!
