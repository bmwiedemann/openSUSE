.SH NAME
clone\-master\-clean\-up - Clean up a system for cloning preparation.

.SH OPTIONS
The program does not accept command line options.

.SH DESCRIPTION
Clean up a system and delete all usage history to prepare it for being cloned.

How to properly clean up a system to create a golden image is highly dependent on installed software, machine configuration, and how the image is supposed to be used. 

.RS 5
1. A golden image for fast and easy way to deploy a freshly installed base operating system (a so-called plain vanilla image).
.PP
2. A golden image that is used during the life cycle management of a system or solution landscape.
.PP
.RE
Life-cycle management images normally include custom additions beyond the base operating system which are needed on all rolled-out systems. This can include additional software, e.g. for backup, hardware support, or monitoring, and system configuration, e.g. the creation of additional local users and changes to configuration files such as 'sudoers' or 'pam'.
.br
Additionally, with the use case of a life cycle management image, there will be a very intensive test cycle of newly installed software and configuration before the golden image is created and rolled out. Such testing can lead a lot of additional log files and temporary data.
.PP
This means that the parts of the operating system which need to be cleaned up are different depending on the use case and that it can be counterproductive to remove some special files or directories.
.PP
For the use case of creating an clean operating system base installation, the standard scope of 'clone-master-clean-up' is generally sufficient.
To allow customization for this use case, use the configuration file \fB/etc/sysconfig/clone-master-clean-up\fR.
.br
Here, you can configure the following behavior:
.RS 5
/etc/sudoers is restored to original, and only root is allowed to run sudo.
.RS 5
default: no
.RE
clean up user ids >= 1000
.RS 5 
default: no
.RE
clean up all zypper repositories
.RS 5
default: no
.RE
remove btrfs snapshots of root filesystem
.RS 5
default: yes
.RE
(If the system is running on EC2) Allow ec2-user to run sudo password-less.
.RS 5
default: no
.RE
.RE
.PP
For the use case of a life cycle management image, it's impossible to write a standard script which will fit all requirements. To enable this use case, clone-master-clean-up allows including a drop-in file containing paths to files and directories that are deleted in addition to doing the standard clean-ups.
.PP
For more information and examples, see \fB/usr/share/clone-master-clean-up/custom_remove.template\fR. Please copy the template file \fB/usr/share/clone-master-clean-up/custom_remove.template\fR to  \fB/etc/clone-master-clean-up/custom_remove\fR and un-comment the parts you need or add additional parts which will fit your needs.
.PP
If the file \fB'/etc/clone-master-clean-up/custom_remove'\fR exists, all included files and directories will be picked up line by line and additionally removed from the golden image.
