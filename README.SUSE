## Get Muse Hub working

MuseScore4 is much more fun if you can use the Muse-Hub extensions.
There are two ways to get it work at present:

I. Use beta version of Muse Sounds Manager https://muse-cdn.com/Muse_Sounds_Manager_Beta.rpm

II. Use Muse-Hub:

Hopefully, the instructions presented here will soon be obsolete, but until they are, they
serve as a step-by-step guide to activating Muse-Hub.


1. Fetch debian package

   At the time of this writing, this is version 1.0.0.392, available at:

   `wget https://pub-c7a32e5b5d834ec9aeef400105452a42.r2.dev/Muse_Hub.deb`


2. Convert to rpm

    `sudo alien -r --scripts Muse_Hub.deb`
    

3.  For Tumbleweed, you need an additional library `lttng-ust0`, the distribution
    went on to `lttng-ust1` already. A build is available in `home:frispete:musescore`.


4.  Install rpm

    `sudo zypper in muse-hub-1.0.0.392-2.x86_64.rpm`
    

5.  Create a compatibility symlink

    `sudo ln -s /var/lib/ca-certificates/ca-bundle.pem /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt`
    

6.  Restart the muse-hub service

    `sudo systemctl restart muse-hub`
    

Now, the muse-hub client should work, but the musescore sampler does not yet.
Install one of the muse-sounds at least. This will also install the necessary
library `libMuseSamplerCoreLib.so` behind the scenes. But unfortunately in the
wrong directory: `/usr/lib`. The easiest work around for this is creating a
compatibility symlink again:

`ln -s /usr/lib/libMuseSamplerCoreLib.so /usr/lib64/libMuseSamplerCoreLib.so`


## Get VSTs working

Only available for the -git build. Install the `vst3sdk` package. Again, you
need to provide a compatibility symlink to make it work:

`ln -s /usr/lib64/VST3 /usr/lib/`

Now, some standard `VSTs` should be available in the git build of MS4.

## Happy composing!
