- Update to version 0.3.0
  * ls_genbasic can now be called with arbitrary coordinates, they need
    not correspond to the full grid.  In particular, single points
    can be passed as arguments as well.
  * Add new routines for shape optimisation with level sets. The main
    one is so_run_descent.
  * Allow saving and replaying shape optimisation descents. This is
    accomplished with so_save_descent and so_replay_descent. Also
    so_explore_descent can be used to interactively explore a descent log.
