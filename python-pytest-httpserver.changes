- Update to 1.0.5
  * Packaging of sdist and the wheel fixed by adding the extra
    files only to the sdist and not to the wheel.
- Release 1.0.4
  * Fixed type hinting of HeaderValueMatcher.DEFAULT_MATCHERS,
    which did not allow modifications, however it is explicitly
    allowed in the documentation.
  * Version of flake8 library updated to require 4.0.0+ at minimum.
    This is required to make flake8 working on recent python
    versions.
- Release 1.0.3
  * Additional type hints improvements to make the library more
    mypy compliant. Imports in __init__.py have been updated to
    indicate that this is a namespace package.
  * Package deployment and CI has been migrated to poetry.
    poetry.lock will be kept up to date. Make target "quick-test"
    renamed to "test". Also, minor adjustments were made regarding
    documentation generation. Make targets should be identical.
    Build results like sdist, and wheel are almost identical to the
    one which was made by setuptools.
