- updated to 0.20
  - The load_class() subroutine now returns the class name on success. Requested
    by Caleb Cushing. RT #76931.
  
  - Exceptions and errors from Class::Load no longer contain references to line
    numbers in Class::Load or Module::Runtime. This applies to exceptions thrown
    by load_class, load_first_existing_class, and load_optional_class, as well
    as the error returned by try_load_class.
  
  - Exceptions are now croaked properly so they appear to come from the calling
    code, not from an internal subroutine. This makes the exceptions look more
    like the ones thrown by Perl's require. RT #68663.

 - Require Package::Stash 0.14+. Fixes RT#75095. Reported by Zefram.

 - A bug in Class::Load caused test failures when Module::Runtime 0.012 was
   used with Perl 5.8.x. Reported by Zefram. RT#74897. ( Jesse Luehrs )
 
 - Require Module::Runtime 0.012, which has a number of useful bug fixes.
 
 - Small test changes to accomodate latest version of
   Module::Implementation. There's no need to upgrade if you're already using
   0.14
 
 - Use Module::Implementation to handle loading the XS or PP versions of the
   code. Using this module fixes a few bugs.
 
 - Under taint mode, setting an implementation in the CLASS_LOAD_IMPLEMENTATION
   env var caused a taint error.
 
 - An invalid value in the CLASS_LOAD_IMPLEMENTATION env var is now detected
   and reported immediately. No attempt is made to load an invalid
   implementation.
 
 - Fix some bugs with our use of Try::Tiny. This could cause warnings on some
   systems with Class::Load::XS wasn't installed. Fixes RT#72345.

  - don't accept package names that start with a digit ( Jesse Luehrs )
  - rewrote some of the guts to use Module::Runtime, rather than
    reimplementing its functionality ( Jesse Luehrs )

- updated to 0.10 2011-09-06
  - make sure the $@ localization doesn't hide errors - invalid
    module name errors were being suppressed on perls before 5.14
    ( Jesse Luehrs )

- Updated to 0.09 2011-09-05
  - fix is_class_loaded to ignore $ISA (but still look for @ISA)
    when trying to determine whether a class is loaded ( Jesse Luehrs )
  - lots of internals cleanup ( Jesse Luehrs )

- updated to 0.08 2011-08-15
  - the previous version was missing a prereq declaration for
    Data::OptList. Reported by Daisuke Maki and Mark Hedges. RT #70285.

- updated to 0.07 2011-08-15
  - All this module's subroutines now accept optional parameters for a 
    module so you can write something like - 
    load_class( 'Foo', { -version => 42 } )
  - There is now a Class::Load::XS distro available on CPAN which implements
    some of this module's code in XS for speed. This code was originally written
    by Goro Fuji and Florian Ragwitz for Class::MOP. You need to install this
    distro explicitly if you want the XS implementation.
  - added a load_first_existing_class subroutine based mostly borrowed from
    Class::MOP
  - fixed a bug where a package with a version object in it's $VERSION would
    not be seen as loaded. Reported by Chris Prather.
