%description
This is a universal Python binding for the LMDB 'Lightning' Database.

LMDB is a tiny database with the following properties:
  * Ordered map interface (keys are always lexicographically sorted).
  * Reader/writer transactions: readers don’t block writers,
    writers don’t block readers.
    Each environment supports one concurrent write transaction.
  * Cheap read transactions.
  * Environments may be opened by multiple processes on the same host.
  * Multiple named databases may be created with transactions covering
    all named databases.
  * Memory mapped, allowing for zero copy lookup and iteration.
    This is optionally exposed to Python using the buffer() interface.
  * Maintenance requires no external process or background threads.
  * No application-level caching is required:
    LMDB uses the operating system’s buffer cache.
