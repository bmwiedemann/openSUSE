- Update to Version 0.25.0
  + Warning
    * Starting with the 0.25.x series of releases, pandas only supports Python 3.5.3 and higher.
    * The minimum supported Python version will be bumped to 3.6 in a future release.
    * Panel has been fully removed. For N-D labeled data structures, please
      use xarray
    * read_pickle read_msgpack are only guaranteed backwards compatible back to
      pandas version 0.20.3
  + Enhancements
    * Groupby aggregation with relabeling
      Pandas has added special groupby behavior, known as "named aggregation", for naming the
      output columns when applying multiple aggregation functions to specific columns.
    * Groupby Aggregation with multiple lambdas
      You can now provide multiple lambda functions to a list-like aggregation in
      pandas.core.groupby.GroupBy.agg.
    * Better repr for MultiIndex
      Printing of MultiIndex instances now shows tuples of each row and ensures
      that the tuple items are vertically aligned, so it's now easier to understand
      the structure of the MultiIndex.
    * Shorter truncated repr for Series and DataFrame
      Currently, the default display options of pandas ensure that when a Series
      or DataFrame has more than 60 rows, its repr gets truncated to this maximum
      of 60 rows (the display.max_rows option). However, this still gives
      a repr that takes up a large part of the vertical screen estate. Therefore,
      a new option display.min_rows is introduced with a default of 10 which
      determines the number of rows showed in the truncated repr:
    * Json normalize with max_level param support
      json_normalize normalizes the provided input dict to all
      nested levels. The new max_level parameter provides more control over
      which level to end normalization.
    * Series.explode to split list-like values to rows
      Series and DataFrame have gained the DataFrame.explode methods to transform
      list-likes to individual rows.
    * DataFrame.plot keywords logy, logx and loglog can now accept the value 'sym' for symlog scaling. 
    * Added support for ISO week year format ('%G-%V-%u') when parsing datetimes using to_datetime 
    * Indexing of DataFrame and Series now accepts zerodim np.ndarray 
    * Timestamp.replace now supports the fold argument to disambiguate DST transition times 
    * DataFrame.at_time and Series.at_time now support datetime.time objects with timezones 
    * DataFrame.pivot_table now accepts an observed parameter which is passed to underlying calls to DataFrame.groupby to speed up grouping categorical data. 
    * Series.str has gained Series.str.casefold method to removes all case distinctions present in a string 
    * DataFrame.set_index now works for instances of abc.Iterator, provided their output is of the same length as the calling frame 
    * DatetimeIndex.union now supports the sort argument. The behavior of the sort parameter matches that of Index.union 
    * RangeIndex.union now supports the sort argument. If sort=False an unsorted Int64Index is always returned. sort=None is the default and returns a monotonically increasing RangeIndex if possible or a sorted Int64Index if not 
    * TimedeltaIndex.intersection now also supports the sort keyword 
    * DataFrame.rename now supports the errors argument to raise errors when attempting to rename nonexistent keys 
    * Added api.frame.sparse for working with a DataFrame whose values are sparse 
    * RangeIndex has gained ~RangeIndex.start, ~RangeIndex.stop, and ~RangeIndex.step attributes 
    * datetime.timezone objects are now supported as arguments to timezone methods and constructors 
    * DataFrame.query and DataFrame.eval now supports quoting column names with backticks to refer to names with spaces 
    * merge_asof now gives a more clear error message when merge keys are categoricals that are not equal 
    * pandas.core.window.Rolling supports exponential (or Poisson) window type 
    * Error message for missing required imports now includes the original import error's text 
    * DatetimeIndex and TimedeltaIndex now have a mean method 
    * DataFrame.describe now formats integer percentiles without decimal point 
    * Added support for reading SPSS .sav files using read_spss 
    * Added new option plotting.backend to be able to select a plotting backend different than the existing matplotlib one. Use pandas.set_option('plotting.backend', '<backend-module>') where <backend-module is a library implementing the pandas plotting API 
    * pandas.offsets.BusinessHour supports multiple opening hours intervals 
    * read_excel can now use openpyxl to read Excel files via the engine='openpyxl' argument. This will become the default in a future release 
    * pandas.io.excel.read_excel supports reading OpenDocument tables. Specify engine='odf' to enable. Consult the IO User Guide <io.ods> for more details 
    * Interval, IntervalIndex, and ~arrays.IntervalArray have gained an ~Interval.is_empty attribute denoting if the given interval(s) are empty 
  + Backwards incompatible API changes
    * Indexing with date strings with UTC offsets
      Indexing a DataFrame or Series with a DatetimeIndex with a
      date string with a UTC offset would previously ignore the UTC offset. Now, the UTC offset
      is respected in indexing. 
    * MultiIndex constructed from levels and codes
      Constructing a MultiIndex with NaN levels or codes value < -1 was allowed previously.
      Now, construction with codes value < -1 is not allowed and NaN levels' corresponding codes
      would be reassigned as -1. 
    * Groupby.apply on DataFrame evaluates first group only once
      The implementation of DataFrameGroupBy.apply()
      previously evaluated the supplied function consistently twice on the first group
      to infer if it is safe to use a fast code path. Particularly for functions with
      side effects, this was an undesired behavior and may have led to surprises. 
    * Concatenating sparse values
      When passed DataFrames whose values are sparse, concat will now return a
      Series or DataFrame with sparse values, rather than a SparseDataFrame .
    * The .str-accessor performs stricter type checks
      Due to the lack of more fine-grained dtypes, Series.str so far only checked whether the data was
      of object dtype. Series.str will now infer the dtype data *within* the Series; in particular,
      'bytes'-only data will raise an exception (except for Series.str.decode, Series.str.get,
      Series.str.len, Series.str.slice).
    * Categorical dtypes are preserved during groupby
      Previously, columns that were categorical, but not the groupby key(s) would be converted to object dtype during groupby operations. Pandas now will preserve these dtypes. 
    * Incompatible Index type unions
      When performing Index.union operations between objects of incompatible dtypes,
      the result will be a base Index of dtype object. This behavior holds true for
      unions between Index objects that previously would have been prohibited. The dtype
      of empty Index objects will now be evaluated before performing union operations
      rather than simply returning the other Index object. Index.union can now be
      considered commutative, such that A.union(B) == B.union(A) .
    * DataFrame groupby ffill/bfill no longer return group labels
      The methods ffill, bfill, pad and backfill of
      DataFrameGroupBy <pandas.core.groupby.DataFrameGroupBy>
      previously included the group labels in the return value, which was
      inconsistent with other groupby transforms. Now only the filled values
      are returned. 
    * DataFrame describe on an empty categorical / object column will return top and freq
      When calling DataFrame.describe with an empty categorical / object
      column, the 'top' and 'freq' columns were previously omitted, which was inconsistent with
      the output for non-empty columns. Now the 'top' and 'freq' columns will always be included,
      with numpy.nan in the case of an empty DataFrame 
    * __str__ methods now call __repr__ rather than vice versa
      Pandas has until now mostly defined string representations in a Pandas objects's
      __str__/__unicode__/__bytes__ methods, and called __str__ from the __repr__
      method, if a specific __repr__ method is not found. This is not needed for Python3.
      In Pandas 0.25, the string representations of Pandas objects are now generally
      defined in __repr__, and calls to __str__ in general now pass the call on to
      the __repr__, if a specific __str__ method doesn't exist, as is standard for Python.
      This change is backward compatible for direct usage of Pandas, but if you subclass
      Pandas objects *and* give your subclasses specific __str__/__repr__ methods,
      you may have to adjust your __str__/__repr__ methods .
    * Indexing an IntervalIndex with Interval objects
      Indexing methods for IntervalIndex have been modified to require exact matches only for Interval queries.
      IntervalIndex methods previously matched on any overlapping Interval.  Behavior with scalar points, e.g. querying
      with an integer, is unchanged .
    * Binary ufuncs on Series now align
      Applying a binary ufunc like numpy.power now aligns the inputs
      when both are Series .
    * Categorical.argsort now places missing values at the end
      Categorical.argsort now places missing values at the end of the array, making it
      consistent with NumPy and the rest of pandas .
    * Column order is preserved when passing a list of dicts to DataFrame
      Starting with Python 3.7 the key-order of dict is guaranteed <https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2017-December/151283.html>_. In practice, this has been true since
      Python 3.6. The DataFrame constructor now treats a list of dicts in the same way as
      it does a list of OrderedDict, i.e. preserving the order of the dicts.
      This change applies only when pandas is running on Python>=3.6 .
    * Increased minimum versions for dependencies
    * DatetimeTZDtype will now standardize pytz timezones to a common timezone instance 
    * Timestamp and Timedelta scalars now implement the to_numpy method as aliases to Timestamp.to_datetime64 and Timedelta.to_timedelta64, respectively. 
    * Timestamp.strptime will now rise a NotImplementedError 
    * Comparing Timestamp with unsupported objects now returns :pyNotImplemented instead of raising TypeError. This implies that unsupported rich comparisons are delegated to the other object, and are now consistent with Python 3 behavior for datetime objects 
    * Bug in DatetimeIndex.snap which didn't preserving the name of the input Index 
    * The arg argument in pandas.core.groupby.DataFrameGroupBy.agg has been renamed to func 
    * The arg argument in pandas.core.window._Window.aggregate has been renamed to func 
    * Most Pandas classes had a __bytes__ method, which was used for getting a python2-style bytestring representation of the object. This method has been removed as a part of dropping Python2 
    * The .str-accessor has been disabled for 1-level MultiIndex, use MultiIndex.to_flat_index if necessary 
    * Removed support of gtk package for clipboards 
    * Using an unsupported version of Beautiful Soup 4 will now raise an ImportError instead of a ValueError 
    * Series.to_excel and DataFrame.to_excel will now raise a ValueError when saving timezone aware data. 
    * ExtensionArray.argsort places NA values at the end of the sorted array. 
    * DataFrame.to_hdf and Series.to_hdf will now raise a NotImplementedError when saving a MultiIndex with extention data types for a fixed format. 
    * Passing duplicate names in read_csv will now raise a ValueError 
  + Deprecations
    * Sparse subclasses
      The SparseSeries and SparseDataFrame subclasses are deprecated. Their functionality is better-provided
      by a Series or DataFrame with sparse values.
    * msgpack format
      The msgpack format is deprecated as of 0.25 and will be removed in a future version. It is recommended to use pyarrow for on-the-wire transmission of pandas objects. 
    * The deprecated .ix[] indexer now raises a more visible FutureWarning instead of DeprecationWarning .
    * Deprecated the units=M (months) and units=Y (year) parameters for units of pandas.to_timedelta, pandas.Timedelta and pandas.TimedeltaIndex 
    * pandas.concat has deprecated the join_axes-keyword. Instead, use DataFrame.reindex or DataFrame.reindex_like on the result or on the inputs 
    * The SparseArray.values attribute is deprecated. You can use np.asarray(...) or
      the SparseArray.to_dense method instead .
    * The functions pandas.to_datetime and pandas.to_timedelta have deprecated the box keyword. Instead, use to_numpy or Timestamp.to_datetime64 or Timedelta.to_timedelta64. 
    * The DataFrame.compound and Series.compound methods are deprecated and will be removed in a future version .
    * The internal attributes _start, _stop and _step attributes of RangeIndex have been deprecated.
      Use the public attributes ~RangeIndex.start, ~RangeIndex.stop and ~RangeIndex.step instead .
    * The Series.ftype, Series.ftypes and DataFrame.ftypes methods are deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
      Instead, use Series.dtype and DataFrame.dtypes .
    * The Series.get_values, DataFrame.get_values, Index.get_values,
      SparseArray.get_values and Categorical.get_values methods are deprecated.
      One of np.asarray(..) or ~Series.to_numpy can be used instead .
    * The 'outer' method on NumPy ufuncs, e.g. np.subtract.outer has been deprecated on Series objects. Convert the input to an array with Series.array first 
    * Timedelta.resolution is deprecated and replaced with Timedelta.resolution_string.  In a future version, Timedelta.resolution will be changed to behave like the standard library datetime.timedelta.resolution 
    * read_table has been undeprecated. 
    * Index.dtype_str is deprecated. 
    * Series.imag and Series.real are deprecated. 
    * Series.put is deprecated. 
    * Index.item and Series.item is deprecated. 
    * The default value ordered=None in ~pandas.api.types.CategoricalDtype has been deprecated in favor of ordered=False. When converting between categorical types ordered=True must be explicitly passed in order to be preserved. 
    * Index.contains is deprecated. Use key in index (__contains__) instead .
    * DataFrame.get_dtype_counts is deprecated. 
    * Categorical.ravel will return a Categorical instead of a np.ndarray

  * Fixed Regressions
    + Fixed regression in to_csv() when handling file-like object
      incorrectly (GH21471)
    + Re-allowed duplicate level names of a MultiIndex. Accessing a

      dataframes with space delimited instead of tab delimited
      (GH21104)
  * Build Changes
    + The source and binary distributions no longer include test data
      files, resulting in smaller download sizes. Tests relying on
      these data files will be skipped when using
      pandas.test(). (GH19320)
  * Bug Fixes
  * Conversion
    + Bug in constructing Index with an iterator or generator

      integer columns (GH21536)
  * Categorical
    + Bug in rendering Series with Categorical dtype in rare
      conditions under Python 2.7 (GH21002)
  * Timezones
    + Bug in Timestamp and DatetimeIndex where passing a Timestamp
      localized after a DST transition would return a datetime before
      the DST transition (GH20854)
    + Bug in comparing DataFrame`s with tz-aware :class:`DatetimeIndex
      columns with a DST transition that raised a KeyError (GH19970)
  * Timedelta
    + Bug in Timedelta where non-zero timedeltas shorter than 1
      microsecond were considered False (GH21484)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun 13 17:45:54 UTC 2018 - toddrme2178@gmail.com

- Update to 0.23.1
  + Fixed Regressions
    * Reverted change to comparing a Series holding datetimes and a datetime.date object
    * Reverted the ability of to_sql() to perform multivalue inserts as this caused regression in certain cases (GH21103). In the future this will be made configurable.
    * Fixed regression in the DatetimeIndex.date and DatetimeIndex.time attributes in case of timezone-aware data: DatetimeIndex.time returned a tz-aware time instead of tz-naive (GH21267) and DatetimeIndex.date returned incorrect date when the input date has a non-UTC timezone (GH21230).
    * Fixed regression in pandas.io.json.json_normalize() when called with None values in nested levels in JSON, and to not drop keys with value as None (GH21158, GH21356).
    * Bug in to_csv() causes encoding error when compression and encoding are specified (GH21241, GH21118)
    * Bug preventing pandas from being importable with -OO optimization (GH21071)
    * Bug in Categorical.fillna() incorrectly raising a TypeError when value the individual categories are iterable and value is an iterable (GH21097, GH19788)
    * Fixed regression in constructors coercing NA values like None to strings when passing dtype=str (GH21083)

  + Performance Improvements
    * Improved performance of CategoricalIndex.is_monotonic_increasing(), CategoricalIndex.is_monotonic_decreasing() and CategoricalIndex.is_monotonic() (GH21025)
    * Improved performance of CategoricalIndex.is_unique() (GH21107)
  + Bug fixes
    * Groupby/Resample/Rolling
      > Bug in DataFrame.agg() where applying multiple aggregation functions to a DataFrame with duplicated column names would cause a stack overflow (GH21063)
      > Bug in pandas.core.groupby.GroupBy.ffill() and pandas.core.groupby.GroupBy.bfill() where the fill within a grouping would not always be applied as intended due to the implementations’ use of a non-stable sort (GH21207)
      > Bug in pandas.core.groupby.GroupBy.rank() where results did not scale to 100% when specifying method='dense' and pct=True
      > Bug in pandas.DataFrame.rolling() and pandas.Series.rolling() which incorrectly accepted a 0 window size rather than raising (GH21286)
    * Data-type specific
      > Bug in Series.str.replace() where the method throws TypeError on Python 3.5.2 (:issue: 21078)
      > Bug in Timedelta: where passing a float with a unit would prematurely round the float precision (:issue: 14156)
      > Bug in pandas.testing.assert_index_equal() which raised AssertionError incorrectly, when comparing two CategoricalIndex objects with param check_categorical=False (GH19776)
    * Sparse
      > Bug in SparseArray.shape which previously only returned the shape SparseArray.sp_values (GH21126)
    * Indexing
      > Bug in Series.reset_index() where appropriate error was not raised with an invalid level name (GH20925)
      > Bug in interval_range() when start/periods or end/periods are specified with float start or end (GH21161)
      > Bug in MultiIndex.set_names() where error raised for a MultiIndex with nlevels == 1 (GH21149)
      > Bug in IntervalIndex constructors where creating an IntervalIndex from categorical data was not fully supported (GH21243, issue:21253)
      > Bug in MultiIndex.sort_index() which was not guaranteed to sort correctly with level=1; this was also causing data misalignment in particular DataFrame.stack() operations (GH20994, GH20945, GH21052)
    * Plotting
      > New keywords (sharex, sharey) to turn on/off sharing of x/y-axis by subplots generated with pandas.DataFrame().groupby().boxplot() (:issue: 20968)
    * I/O
      > Bug in IO methods specifying compression='zip' which produced uncompressed zip archives (GH17778, GH21144)
      > Bug in DataFrame.to_stata() which prevented exporting DataFrames to buffers and most file-like objects (GH21041)
      > Bug in read_stata() and StataReader which did not correctly decode utf-8 strings on Python 3 from Stata 14 files (dta version 118) (GH21244)
      > Bug in IO JSON read_json() reading empty JSON schema with orient='table' back to DataFrame caused an error (GH21287)
    * Reshaping
      > Bug in concat() where error was raised in concatenating Series with numpy scalar and tuple names (GH21015)
      > Bug in concat() warning message providing the wrong guidance for future behavior (GH21101)
    * Other

  (see http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/whatsnew.html#v0-16-2-june-12-2015)
  * Highlights
    + A new pipe method
    + Documentation on how to use numba with pandas
  * Enhancements
    + Added rsplit to Index/Series StringMethods (GH10303)
    + Removed the hard-coded size limits on the DataFrame HTML
      representation in the IPython notebook, and leave this to
      IPython itself (only for IPython v3.0 or greater). This
      eliminates the duplicate scroll bars that appeared in the
      notebook with large frames (GH10231).

      Note that the notebook has a toggle output scrolling feature to
      limit the display of very large frames (by clicking left of the
      output). You can also configure the way DataFrames are displayed
      using the pandas options, see here here.
    + axis parameter of DataFrame.quantile now accepts also index and
      column. (GH9543)
  * API Changes
    + Holiday now raises NotImplementedError if both offset and
      observance are used in the constructor instead of returning an
      incorrect result (GH10217).
  * Performance Improvements
    + Improved Series.resample performance with dtype=datetime64[ns]
      (GH7754)
    + Increase performance of str.split when expand=True (GH10081)
  * Bug Fixes
    + Bug in Series.hist raises an error when a one row Series was
      given (GH10214)
    + Bug where HDFStore.select modifies the passed columns list
      (GH7212)
    + Bug in Categorical repr with display.width of None in Python 3

      fractional (GH10209)
    + Bug in DataFrame.to_json with mixed data types (GH10289)
    + Bug in cache updating when consolidating (GH10264)
    + Bug in mean() where integer dtypes can overflow (GH10172)
    + Bug where Panel.from_dict does not set dtype when specified
      (GH10058)
    + Bug in Index.union raises AttributeError when passing
      array-likes. (GH10149)
    + Bug in Timestamp‘s’ microsecond, quarter, dayofyear, week and
      daysinmonth properties return np.int type, not built-in
      int. (GH10050)
    + Bug in NaT raises AttributeError when accessing to daysinmonth,
      dayofweek properties. (GH10096)
    + Bug in Index repr when using the max_seq_items=None setting

      ( GH9059, GH8639, GH9663, GH10121)
    + Bug in displaying datetimes with mixed frequencies; display ‘ms’
      datetimes to the proper precision. (GH10170)
    + Bug in setitem where type promotion is applied to the entire
      block (GH10280)
    + Bug in Series arithmetic methods may incorrectly hold names
      (GH10068)
    + Bug in GroupBy.get_group when grouping on multiple keys, one of
      which is categorical. (GH10132)
    + Bug in DatetimeIndex and TimedeltaIndex names are lost after
      timedelta arithmetics ( GH9926)

      (GH10156)
    + Bug where infer_freq infers timerule (WOM-5XXX) unsupported by
      to_offset (GH9425)
    + Bug in DataFrame.to_hdf() where table format would raise a
      seemingly unrelated error for invalid (non-string) column
      names. This is now explicitly forbidden. (GH9057)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May 19 09:18:50 UTC 2015 - toddrme2178@gmail.com

- Update to version 0.16.1
  * Highlights
    - Support for a ``CategoricalIndex``, a category based index
    - New section on how-to-contribute to pandas
    - Revised "Merge, join, and concatenate" documentation, 
      including graphical examples to make it easier to understand
      each operations
    - New method sample for drawing random samples from Series,
      DataFrames and Panels.
    - The default Index printing has changed to a more uniform 
      format
    - BusinessHour datetime-offset is now supported
  * Enhancements
    - BusinessHour`offset is now supported, which represents 
      business hours starting from 09:00 - 17:00 on BusinessDay by 
      default.
    - DataFrame.diff now takes an axis parameter that determines the
      direction of differencing
    - Allow clip, clip_lower, and clip_upper to accept array-like 
      arguments as thresholds (This is a regression from 0.11.0).
      These methods now have an axis parameter which determines 
      how the Series or DataFrame will be aligned with the 
      threshold(s).
    - DataFrame.mask() and Series.mask() now support same keywords 
      as where
    - drop function can now accept errors keyword to suppress 
      ValueError raised when any of label does not exist in the 
      target data.
    - Allow conversion of values with dtype datetime64 or timedelta64
      to strings using astype(str)
    - get_dummies function now accepts sparse keyword.  If set to
      True, the return DataFrame is sparse, e.g. SparseDataFrame.
    - Period now accepts datetime64 as value input.
    - Allow timedelta string conversion when leading zero is 
      missing from time definition, ie 0:00:00 vs 00:00:00.
    - Allow Panel.shift with axis='items'
    - Trying to write an excel file now raises NotImplementedError 
      if the DataFrame has a MultiIndex instead of writing a broken
      Excel file.
    - Allow Categorical.add_categories to accept Series or np.array.
    - Add/delete str/dt/cat accessors dynamically from __dir__.
    - Add normalize as a dt accessor method.
    - DataFrame and Series now have _constructor_expanddim property
      as overridable constructor for one higher dimensionality 
      data. This should be used only when it is really needed
    - pd.lib.infer_dtype now returns 'bytes' in Python 3 where 
      appropriate.
    - We introduce a CategoricalIndex, a new type of index object
      that is useful for supporting indexing with duplicates. This
      is a container around a Categorical (introduced in v0.15.0)
      and allows efficient indexing and storage of an index with a
      large number of duplicated elements. Prior to 0.16.1, 
      setting the index of a DataFrame/Series with a category 
      dtype would convert this to regular object-based Index.
    - Series, DataFrames, and Panels now have a new method: 
      pandas.DataFrame.sample. The method accepts a specific number
      of rows or columns to return, or a fraction of the total
      number or rows or columns. It also has options for sampling
      with or without replacement, for passing in a column for
      weights for non-uniform sampling, and for setting seed values
      to facilitate replication.
    - The following new methods are accesible via .str accessor to
      apply the function to each values.
      + capitalize()
      + swapcase()
      + normalize()
      + partition()
      + rpartition()
      + index()
      + rindex()
      + translate()
    - Added StringMethods (.str accessor) to Index
    - split now takes expand keyword to specify whether to expand
      dimensionality. return_type is deprecated.
  * API changes
    - When passing in an ax to df.plot( ..., ax=ax), the sharex 
      kwarg will now default to False.
    - Add support for separating years and quarters using dashes, 
      for example 2014-Q1.
    - pandas.DataFrame.assign now inserts new columns in 
      alphabetical order. Previously the order was arbitrary.
    - By default, read_csv and read_table will now try to infer
      the compression type based on the file extension. Set 
      compression=None to restore the previous behavior 
      (no decompression).
    - The string representation of Index and its sub-classes have 
      now been unified. These will show a single-line display if 
      there are few values; a wrapped multi-line display for a lot
      of values (but less than display.max_seq_items; if lots of 
      items > display.max_seq_items) will show a truncated display 
      (the head and tail of the data). The formatting for 
      MultiIndex is unchanges (a multi-line wrapped display). The
      display width responds to the option display.max_seq_items,
      which is defaulted to 100.
  * Deprecations
    - Series.str.split's return_type keyword was removed in favor 
      of expand
  * Performance Improvements
    - Improved csv write performance with mixed dtypes, including 
      datetimes by up to 5x
    - Improved csv write performance generally by 2x
    - Improved the performance of pd.lib.max_len_string_array 
      by 5-7x
  * Bug Fixes
    - Bug where labels did not appear properly in the legend of 
      DataFrame.plot(), passing label= arguments works, and Series 
      indices are no longer mutated.
    - Bug in json serialization causing a segfault when a frame had 
      zero length.
    - Bug in read_csv where missing trailing delimiters would cause 
      segfault.
    - Bug in retaining index name on appending

      property to secondary axes specifying itself recursively.
    - Bug in Series.quantile on empty Series of type Datetime or

      symbol in the style strings
    - Not showing a DeprecationWarning on combining list-likes with

      dataframes
    - Bug in invalid attribute access on a TimedeltaIndex 
      incorrectly raised ValueError instead of AttributeError
    - Bug in unequal comparisons between categorical data and a 
      scalar, which was not in the categories (e.g. 
      Series(Categorical(list("abc"), ordered=True)) > "d". This 
      returned False for all elements, but now raises a TypeError. 
      Equality comparisons also now return False for == and True 
      for !=.
    - Bug in DataFrame __setitem__ when right hand side is a

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 24 12:44:20 UTC 2015 - toddrme2178@gmail.com
   
- update to version 0.16.0:
  * Highlights:
    - DataFrame.assign method
    - Series.to_coo/from_coo methods to interact with scipy.sparse
    - Backwards incompatible change to Timedelta to conform the .seconds 
      attribute with datetime.timedelta
    - Changes to the .loc slicing API to conform with the behavior of .ix
    - Changes to the default for ordering in the Categorical constructor
    - Enhancement to the .str accessor to make string operations easier
    - The pandas.tools.rplot, pandas.sandbox.qtpandas and pandas.rpy 
      modules are deprecated.  We refer users to external packages like 
      seaborn, pandas-qt and rpy2 for similar or equivalent functionality
  * New features
    - Inspired by dplyr's mutate verb, DataFrame has a new assign method.
    - Added SparseSeries.to_coo and SparseSeries.from_coo methods for 
      converting to and from scipy.sparse.coo_matrix instances.
    - Following new methods are accesible via .str accessor to apply the 
      function to each values. This is intended to make it more consistent with
      standard methods on strings: isalnum(), isalpha(), isdigit(), isdigit(),
      isspace(), islower(), isupper(), istitle(), isnumeric(), isdecimal(),
      find(), rfind(), ljust(), rjust(), zfill()
    - Reindex now supports method='nearest' for frames or series with a 
      monotonic increasing or decreasing index.
    - The read_excel() function's sheetname argument now accepts a list and 
      None, to get multiple or all sheets respectively. If more than one sheet 
      is specified, a dictionary is returned.
    - Allow Stata files to be read incrementally with an iterator; support for 
      long strings in Stata files.
    - Paths beginning with ~ will now be expanded to begin with the user's home
      directory.
    - Added time interval selection in get_data_yahoo.
    - Added Timestamp.to_datetime64() to complement Timedelta.to_timedelta64().
    - tseries.frequencies.to_offset() now accepts Timedelta as input.
    - Lag parameter was added to the autocorrelation method of Series, defaults
      to lag-1 autocorrelation.
    - Timedelta will now accept nanoseconds keyword in constructor.
    - SQL code now safely escapes table and column names.
    - Added auto-complete for Series.str.<tab>, Series.dt.<tab> and 
      Series.cat.<tab>.
    - Index.get_indexer now supports method='pad' and method='backfill' even 
      for any target array, not just monotonic targets.
    - Index.asof now works on all index types.
    - A verbose argument has been augmented in io.read_excel(), defaults to 
      False. Set to True to print sheet names as they are parsed.
    - Added days_in_month (compatibility alias daysinmonth) property to 
      Timestamp, DatetimeIndex, Period, PeriodIndex, and Series.dt.
    - Added decimal option in to_csv to provide formatting for non-'.' decimal 
      separators
    - Added normalize option for Timestamp to normalized to midnight
    - Added example for DataFrame import to R using HDF5 file and rhdf5
      library.
  * Backwards incompatible API changes
    - In v0.16.0, we are restoring the API to match that of datetime.timedelta.
      Further, the component values are still available through the .components
      accessor. This affects the .seconds and .microseconds accessors, and 
      removes the .hours, .minutes, .milliseconds accessors. These changes 
      affect TimedeltaIndex and the Series .dt accessor as well.
    - The behavior of a small sub-set of edge cases for using .loc have 
      changed. Furthermore we have improved the content of the error messages 
      that are raised:
      + Slicing with .loc where the start and/or stop bound is not found in 
        the index is now allowed; this previously would raise a KeyError. This 
        makes the behavior the same as .ix in this case. This change is only 
        for slicing, not when indexing with a single label.
      + Allow slicing with float-like values on an integer index for .ix. 
        Previously this was only enabled for .loc:
      + Provide a useful exception for indexing with an invalid type for that 
        index when using .loc. For example trying to use .loc on an index of 
        type DatetimeIndex or PeriodIndex or TimedeltaIndex, with an integer 
        (or a float).
    - In prior versions, Categoricals that had an unspecified ordering 
      (meaning no ordered keyword was passed) were defaulted as ordered 
      Categoricals. Going forward, the ordered keyword in the Categorical 
      constructor will default to False. Ordering must now be explicit.
      Furthermore, previously you *could* change the ordered attribute of a 
      Categorical by just setting the attribute, e.g. cat.ordered=True; This is
      now deprecated and you should use cat.as_ordered() or cat.as_unordered().
      These will by default return a **new** object and not modify the 
      existing object.
    - Index.duplicated now returns np.array(dtype=bool) rather than 
      Index(dtype=object) containing bool values.
    - DataFrame.to_json now returns accurate type serialisation for each column 
      for frames of mixed dtype
    - DatetimeIndex, PeriodIndex and TimedeltaIndex.summary now output the same 
      format.
    - TimedeltaIndex.freqstr now output the same string format as 
      DatetimeIndex.
    - Bar and horizontal bar plots no longer add a dashed line along the info 
      axis. The prior style can be achieved with matplotlib's axhline or 
      axvline methods.
    - Series accessors .dt, .cat and .str now raise AttributeError instead of 
      TypeError if the series does not contain the appropriate type of data. 
      This  follows Python's built-in exception hierarchy more closely and 
      ensures that  tests like hasattr(s, 'cat') are consistent on both Python 
      2 and 3.
    - Series now supports bitwise operation for integral types. Previously even 
      if the input dtypes were integral, the output dtype was coerced to bool.
    - During division involving a Series or DataFrame, 0/0 and 0//0 now give 
      np.nan instead of np.inf.
    - Series.values_counts and Series.describe for categorical data will now 
      put NaN entries at the end.
    - Series.describe for categorical data will now give counts and frequencies 
      of 0, not NaN, for unused categories
    - Due to a bug fix, looking up a partial string label with 
      DatetimeIndex.asof now includes values that match the string, even if 
      they are after the start of the partial string label. Old behavior:
  * Deprecations
    - The rplot trellis plotting interface is deprecated and will be removed
      in a future version. We refer to external packages like
      seaborn for similar but more refined functionality.
    - The pandas.sandbox.qtpandas interface is deprecated and will be removed 
      in a future version.
      We refer users to the external package pandas-qt.
    - The pandas.rpy interface is deprecated and will be removed in a future 
      version.
      Similar functionaility can be accessed thru the rpy2 project
    - Adding DatetimeIndex/PeriodIndex to another DatetimeIndex/PeriodIndex is 
      being deprecated as a set-operation. This will be changed to a TypeError 
      in a future version. .union() should be used for the union set operation.
    - Subtracting DatetimeIndex/PeriodIndex from another 
      DatetimeIndex/PeriodIndex is being deprecated as a set-operation. This 
      will be  changed to an actual numeric subtraction yielding a 
      TimeDeltaIndex in a future  version. .difference() should be used for 
      the differencing set operation.
  * Removal of prior version deprecations/changes
    - DataFrame.pivot_table and crosstab's rows and cols keyword arguments were 
      removed in favor

Mon Jan 12 13:46:26 UTC 2015 - toddrme2178@gmail.com

- update to version 0.15.2:
  * API changes:
    - Indexing in MultiIndex beyond lex-sort depth is now supported,
      though a lexically sorted index will have a better
      performance. (GH2646)
    - Bug in unique of Series with category dtype, which returned all
      categories regardless whether they were "used" or not (see
      GH8559 for the discussion). Previous behaviour was to return all
      categories.
    - Series.all and Series.any now support the level and skipna
      parameters. Series.all, Series.any, Index.all, and Index.any no
      longer support the out and keepdims parameters, which existed
      for compatibility with ndarray. Various index types no longer
      support the all and any aggregation functions and will now raise
      TypeError. (GH8302).
    - Allow equality comparisons of Series with a categorical dtype
      and object dtype; previously these would raise TypeError
      (GH8938)
    - Bug in NDFrame: conflicting attribute/column names now behave
      consistently between getting and setting. Previously, when both
      a column and attribute named y existed, data.y would return the
      attribute, while data.y = z would update the column (GH8994)
    - Timestamp('now') is now equivalent to Timestamp.now() in that it
      returns the local time rather than UTC. Also, Timestamp('today')
      is now equivalent to Timestamp.today() and both have tz as a
      possible argument. (GH9000)
    - Fix negative step support for label-based slices (GH8753)
  * Enhancements:
    - Added ability to export Categorical data to Stata (GH8633). See
      here for limitations of categorical variables exported to Stata
      data files.
    - Added flag order_categoricals to StataReader and read_stata to
      select whether to order imported categorical data (GH8836). See
      here for more information on importing categorical variables
      from Stata data files.
    - Added ability to export Categorical data to to/from HDF5
      (GH7621). Queries work the same as if it was an object
      array. However, the category dtyped data is stored in a more
      efficient manner. See here for an example and caveats
      w.r.t. prior versions of pandas.
    - Added support for searchsorted() on Categorical class (GH8420).
    - Added the ability to specify the SQL type of columns when
      writing a DataFrame to a database (GH8778). For example,
      specifying to use the sqlalchemy String type instead of the
      default Text type for string columns.
    - Series.all and Series.any now support the level and skipna
      parameters (GH8302).
    - Panel now supports the all and any aggregation
      functions. (GH8302).
    - Added support for utcfromtimestamp(), fromtimestamp(), and
      combine() on Timestamp class (GH5351).
    - Added Google Analytics (pandas.io.ga) basic documentation
      (GH8835).
    - Timedelta arithmetic returns NotImplemented in unknown cases,
      allowing extensions by custom classes (GH8813).
    - Timedelta now supports arithemtic with numpy.ndarray objects of
      the appropriate dtype (numpy 1.8 or newer only) (GH8884).
    - Added Timedelta.to_timedelta64() method to the public API
      (GH8884).
    - Added gbq.generate_bq_schema() function to the gbq module
      (GH8325).
    - Series now works with map objects the same way as generators
      (GH8909).
    - Added context manager to HDFStore for automatic closing
      (GH8791).
    - to_datetime gains an exact keyword to allow for a format to not
      require an exact match for a provided format string (if its
      False). exact defaults to True (meaning that exact matching is
      still the default) (GH8904)
    - Added axvlines boolean option to parallel_coordinates plot
      function, determines whether vertical lines will be printed,
      default is True
    - Added ability to read table footers to read_html (GH8552).
    - to_sql now infers datatypes of non-NA values for columns that
      contain NA values and have dtype object (GH8778).
  * Performance:
    - Reduce memory usage when skiprows is an integer in read_csv
      (GH8681)
    - Performance boost for to_datetime conversions with a passed
      format=, and the exact=False (GH8904)
  * Bug fixes:
    - Bug in concat of Series with category dtype which were coercing
      to object. (GH8641)
    - Bug in Timestamp-Timestamp not returning a Timedelta type and
      datelike-datelike ops with timezones (GH8865)
    - Made consistent a timezone mismatch exception (either tz
      operated with None or incompatible timezone), will now return
      TypeError rather than ValueError (a couple of edge cases only),
      (GH8865)
    - Bug in using a pd.Grouper(key=...) with no level/axis or level
      only (GH8795, GH8866)
    - Report a TypeError when invalid/no paramaters are passed in a
      groupby (GH8015)
    - Bug in packaging pandas with py2app/cx_Freeze (GH8602, GH8831)
    - Bug in groupby signatures that didn’t include *args or **kwargs
      (GH8733).
    - io.data.Options now raises RemoteDataError when no expiry dates
      are available from Yahoo and when it receives no data from Yahoo
      (GH8761), (GH8783).
    - Unclear error message in csv parsing when passing dtype and
      names and the parsed data is a different data type (GH8833)
    - Bug in slicing a multi-index with an empty list and at least one
      boolean indexer (GH8781)
    - io.data.Options now raises RemoteDataError when no expiry dates
      are available from Yahoo (GH8761).
    - Timedelta kwargs may now be numpy ints and floats (GH8757).
    - Fixed several outstanding bugs for Timedelta arithmetic and
      comparisons (GH8813, GH5963, GH5436).
    - sql_schema now generates dialect appropriate CREATE TABLE
      statements (GH8697)
    - slice string method now takes step into account (GH8754)
    - Bug in BlockManager where setting values with different type
      would break block integrity (GH8850)
    - Bug in DatetimeIndex when using time object as key (GH8667)
    - Bug in merge where how='left' and sort=False would not preserve
      left frame order (GH7331)
    - Bug in MultiIndex.reindex where reindexing at level would not
      reorder labels (GH4088)
    - Bug in certain operations with dateutil timezones, manifesting
      with dateutil 2.3 (GH8639)
    - Regression in DatetimeIndex iteration with a Fixed/Local offset
      timezone (GH8890)
    - Bug in to_datetime when parsing a nanoseconds using the %f
      format (GH8989)
    - io.data.Options now raises RemoteDataError when no expiry dates
      are available from Yahoo and when it receives no data from Yahoo
      (GH8761), (GH8783).
    - Fix: The font size was only set on x axis if vertical or the y
      axis if horizontal. (GH8765)
    - Fixed division by 0 when reading big csv files in python 3
      (GH8621)
    - Bug in outputing a Multindex with to_html,index=False which
      would add an extra column (GH8452)
    - Imported categorical variables from Stata files retain the
      ordinal information in the underlying data (GH8836).
    - Defined .size attribute across NDFrame objects to provide compat
      with numpy >= 1.9.1; buggy with np.array_split (GH8846)
    - Skip testing of histogram plots for matplotlib <= 1.2 (GH8648).
    - Bug where get_data_google returned object dtypes (GH3995)

      levels. (GH8844)
    - Bug in that Option context applied on __enter__ (GH8514)
    - Bug in resample that causes a ValueError when resampling across
      multiple days and the last offset is not calculated from the
      start of the range (GH8683)
    - Bug where DataFrame.plot(kind='scatter') fails when checking if
      an np.array is in the DataFrame (GH8852)
    - Bug in pd.infer_freq/DataFrame.inferred_freq that prevented
