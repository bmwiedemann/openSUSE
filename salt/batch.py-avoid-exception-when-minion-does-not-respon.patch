Subject: [PATCH] batch.py: avoid exception when minion does not respond
 (bsc#1135507)
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

We have several issues reporting that salt is throwing exception when
the minion does not respond. This change avoid the exception adding a
default data to the minion when it fails to respond. This patch based
on the patch suggested by @roskens.

Issues #46876 #48509 #50238
bsc#1135507
