  Extend the sounddevice and soundfile hooks to collect system-installed shared libraries in cases when the libraries are
  not bundled with the package (i.e., linux PyPI wheels, Anaconda on all OSes). (#487)
  Fix a TypeError raised by the clr hook when pythonnet dist lacks the file list metadata. (#486)
  Have clr hook check for availability of the pythonnet before trying to query its metadata. Fixes an importlib.metadata.PackageNotFoundError
  raised by the clr hook when the hook is triggered by a module or a package named clr other than the clr extension module from pythonnet. (#486)
  Have the pyqtgraph hook collect the colormap files and their license files from the package. (#501)
  Implement preliminary support for handling subprocesses used by pyqtgraph.multiprocess, for example in pyqtgraph RemoteGraphicsView widget.
  The user is still required to ensure that stdlib's multiprocessing.freeze_support is called in the entry-point script before using pyqtgraph.
  In addition, with onefile builds, the user must set the _MEIPASS2 environment variable to the value of sys._MEIPASS before using pyqtgraph. (#501)
  In clr hook for pythonnet collect the Python.Runtime.dll as a data file on non-Windows OSes to prevent errors during binary dependency analysis. (#500)
