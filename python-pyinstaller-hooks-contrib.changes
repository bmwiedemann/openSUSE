  Fix a TypeError raised by the clr hook when pythonnet dist lacks the file list metadata. (#486)

  raised by the clr hook when the hook is triggered by a module or a package named clr other than the clr extension module from pythonnet. (#486)

  The user is still required to ensure that stdlib's multiprocessing.freeze_support is called in the entry-point script before using pyqtgraph.
  In addition, with onefile builds, the user must set the _MEIPASS2 environment variable to the value of sys._MEIPASS before using pyqtgraph. (#501)
  In clr hook for pythonnet collect the Python.Runtime.dll as a data file on non-Windows OSes to prevent errors during binary dependency analysis. (#500)
