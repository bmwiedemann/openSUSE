%description
An utility for programmatically editing configuration files. Augeas
parses configuration files into a tree structure.

The transformation works very hard to preserve comments and formatting
details. It is controlled by ``lens'' definitions that describe the
file format and the transformation into a tree.

%description    lenses
Augeas parses configuration files described in lenses into a tree
structure, which it exposes through its public API. Lenses are the
building blocks of the file <-> tree transformation. The transformation
is controlled by ``lens'' definitions that describe the file format and
mapping of its contents into a tree. This package includes the official
set of lenses.

Summary:        Set of tests for official Augeas lenses
Requires:       %{name}-lenses = %{version}

%description    lense-tests
Set of tests for official Augeas lenses. These can be used when
modifying the official lenses, or when creating new ones.
