- Update to version 0.9.12~beta5 (changes since 0.9.12~beta3):
  * When an interval based condition was created and hours were
    chosen as time unit, the applet ignored this choice and still
    used minutes (gh#almostearthling/when-command#91).
  * Introduce some more thorough checks when registering stock and
    user events, so that unsupported D-Bus signals result in
    disabled events when all possible implementations have been
    tried for. This resulted in a more portable way to handle
    battery related events, that weren't actually functioning on
    Ubuntu 16.04 due to changes in the D-Bus implementation
    (gh#almostearthling/when-command#92).

  * Workaround a potential error when a locale is not supported.
- Add a missing python3-gobject-Gdk dependency.

- Update to version 0.9.11~beta1 (changes since 0.9.10~beta2):

    be retained when set through the Remote API.

    gvfs 1.26, lack of it prevented When to correctly register
    events related to connection of external storage devices.

- Update to 0.9.9~beta2 (changes since 0.9.4~beta2):
  * Register all stock events from Linux Mint 17.x with
    Cinnamon desktop environment and Elementary OS Freya.
  * Inspect the idle time by directly querying the X server instead
    of relying on xprintidle.
  * Immediately apply most of the settings as soon as the
    Settings box is accepted.
  * Expose more conventionally named methods on the D-Bus.
  * A full-featured D-Bus interface.
  * Fix a bug that prevented dialog boxes to be shown if When was
    restarted in Minimalistic Mode and was reset to normal mode
    through the Settings dialog box.
  * The D-Bus Remote API is now rather stable and usable, through
    bug fixes and introduction of more thorough checks.
  * As a side effect, the import/export functions are more robust,
    as well as the ability to correctly create items from
    Item Definition Files.
  * Some glitches in the UI and other minor and possibly
    not-so-minor issues have been corrected.
- Add some missing dependencies.

- Update to 0.9.4~beta2 (changes since 0.9.2~beta1):
  * Add battery related events for event-based conditions.
    Supported events are: charging, discharging, low battery.
  * Package has been stripped most of the documentation, since the
    documentation is much more accessible online than in the
    installation location.
  * A system-wide applet shortcut when using the LSB packaged
    version.
  * Item CLI Management (tasks, conditions and signal handlers can
    be added, listed and deleted using the CLI and item definition
    files).
  * Minimalistic Mode: the menu entries that show dialog boxes and
    their respective CLI counterparts can be hidden and disabled,
    de facto freezing the configuration and reducing memory
    footprint.
