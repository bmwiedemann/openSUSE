Sat Feb 27 15:00:17 UTC 2021 - Sebastian Wagner <sebix+novell.com@sebix.at>

- Update dependencies
- Update to version 168:
  * Don't call difflib.Differ.compare with very large inputs; it is at least
    O(n^2) and makes diffoscope appear to hang.
    (Closes: reproducible-builds/diffoscope#240)
  * Don't use "Inheriting PATH of X" in debug log message; use "PATH is X".
  * Correct the capitalisation of jQuery.
- Update to version 167:
  * Temporary directory handling:
    - Ensure we cleanup our temporary directory by avoiding confusion between
      the TemporaryDirectory instance and the underlying directory.
      (Closes: deb#981123)
    - Use a potentially-useful suffix to our temporary directory based on the
      command-line passed to diffoscope.
    - Fix some tempfile/weakref interaction in Python 3.7 (ie. Debian buster).
      (Closes: reproducible-builds/diffoscope#239)
    - If our temporary directory does not exist anymore (eg. it has been
      cleaned up in tests, signal handling or reference counting),  make sure
      we recreate it.
  * Bug fixes:
    - Don't rely on magic.Magic(...) to have an identical API between file's
      magic.py and PyPI's "python-magic" library.
      (Closes: reproducible-builds/diffoscope#238)
    - Don't rely on dumpimage returning an appropriate exit code; check that
      the file actually exists after we call it.
  * Codebase changes:
    - Set a default Config.extended_filesystem_attributes.
    - Drop unused Config.acl and Config.xattr attributes.
    - Tidy imports in diffoscope/comparators/fit.py.
  * Tests:
    - Add u-boot-tools to test dependencies so that salsa.debian.org pipelines
      actually test the new FIT comparator.
    - Strip newlines when determining Black version to avoid "requires black
      >= 20.8b1 (18.9b0\n detected)" in test output (NB. embedded newline).
    - Gnumeric is back in testing so re-add to test dependencies.
    - Use assert_diff (over get_data, etc.) in the FIT and APK comparators.
    - Mark test_apk.py::test_android_manifest as being allowed to fail for now.
    - Fix the FIT tests in buster and unstable.
- Update to version 166:
  [ Chris Lamb ]
  * New features and bugfixes:
    - Explicitly remove our top-level temporary directory.
      (Closes: deb#981123, reproducible-builds/diffoscope#234)
    - Increase fuzzy matching threshold to 130 ensure that we show more
      differences. (Closes: reproducible-builds/diffoscope#232)
    - Save our sys.argv in our top-level temporary directory in case it
      helps debug current/errant temporary directories.
    - Prefer to use "magic.Magic" over the "magic.open" compatibility
      interface. (Closes: reproducible-builds/diffoscope#236)
    - Reduce fuzzy threshold to 110 to prevent some test failures.
      (Closes: reproducible-builds/diffoscope#233)
  * Output improvements:
    - Show fuzzyness amount in percentage terms, not out of the
      rather-arbitrary "400".
    - Improve the logging of fuzzy matching.
    - Print the free space in our temporary directory when we create it, not
      from within diffoscope.main.
  * Codebase improvements:
    - Tidy the diffoscopecomparators.utils.fuzzy module.
    - Update my copyright years.
    - Clarify the grammar of a comment.
    - Clarify in a comment that __del__ is not always called, so temporary
      directories are not neccessary removed the *moment* they go out of scope.
  [ Conrad Ratschan ]
  * Fix U-Boot Flattened Image Tree ("FIT") image detection for larger image
    files. (MR: reproducible-builds/diffoscope!75)
- Update to version 165:
  [ Dimitrios Apostolou ]
  * Introduce the --no-acl and --no-xattr arguments [later collapsed to
    --extended-filesystem-attributes] to improve performance.
  * Avoid calling the external stat command.
  [ Chris Lamb ]
  * Collapse --acl and --xattr into --extended-filesystem-attributes to cover
    all of these extended attributes, defaulting the new option to false (ie.
    to not check these very expensive external calls).
  [ Mattia Rizzolo ]
  * Override several lintian warnings regarding prebuilt binaries in the
  * source.
  * Add a pytest.ini file to explicitly use Junit's xunit2 format.
  * Ignore the Python DeprecationWarning message regarding the `imp` module
    deprecation as it comes from a third-party library.
  * debian/rules: filter the content of the d/*.substvars files
- Update to version 164:
  [ Chris Lamb ]
  * Truncate jsondiff differences at 512 bytes lest they consume the entire page.
  * Wrap our external call to cmp(1) with a profile (to match the internal
    profiling).
  * Add a note regarding the specific ordering of the new
    all_tools_are_listed test.
  [ Dimitrios Apostolou ]
  * Performance improvements:
    - Improve speed of has_same_content by spawning cmp(1) less frequently.
    - Log whenever the external cmp(1) command is spawn.ed
    - Avoid invoking external diff for identical, short outputs.
  * Rework handling of temporary files:
    - Clean up temporary directories as we go along, instead of at the end.
    - Delete FIFO files when the FIFO feeder's context manager exits.
  [ Mattia Rizzolo ]
  * Fix a number of potential crashes in --list-debian-substvars, including
    explicitly listing lipo and otool as external tools.
   - Remove redundant code and let object destructors clean up after themselves.
  [ Conrad Ratschan ]
  * Add a comparator for Flattened Image Trees (FIT) files, a boot image format
    used by U-Boot.
- Update to version 163:
  [ Chris Lamb ]
  * Bug fixes & new features:
    - Normalise "ret" to "retq" in objdump output to support multiple versions
      of obdump(1). (Closes: deb#976760, reproducible-builds/diffoscope#227)
    - Don't show progress indicators when running zstd(1).
      (Closes: reproducible-builds/diffoscope#226)
    - Move the slightly-confusing behaviour of loading an "existing diff" if a
      single file is passed to diffoscope to the new --load-existing-diff
      command.
  * Output improvements:
    - Use pprint.pformat in the JSON comparator to serialise the differences
      from jsondiff to make the output render better.
    - Correct tense in --debug log output.
  * Code quality:
    * Don't use an old-style "super" call.
    - Rewrite the filter routine for post-processing output from readelf(1).
    - Update my copyright years.
    - Remove unncessary PEP 263 encoding lines (replaced via PEP 3120).
    - Use "minimal" instead of "basic" as a variable name to match the
      underlying package name.
    - Add comment regarding Java tests for diffoscope contributors who are not
      using Debian. (Re: reproducible-builds/diffoscope!58)
  * Debian packaging:
    - Update debian/copyright to match copyright notices in source-tree.
      (Closes: reproducible-builds/diffoscope#224)
    - Ensure the new "diffoscope-minimal" package has a different short
      description from the main "diffoscope" one.
  [ Jean-Romain Garnier ]
  * Add tests for OpenJDK 14.
  [ Conrad Ratschan ]
  * Add comparator for "legacy" uboot uImage files.
    (MR: reproducible-builds/diffoscope!69)
- Update to version 162:
  [ Chris Lamb ]
  * Don't depends on radare2 in the Debian autopkgtests as it will not be in
    bullseye due to security considerations (#950372). (Closes: deb#975313)
  * Avoid "Command `s p a c e d o u t` failed" messages when creating an
    artificial CalledProcessError instance in our generic from_operation
    feeder creator.
  * Overhaul long and short descriptions.
  * Use the operation's full name so that "command failed" messages include
    its arguments.
  * Add a missing comma in a comment.
  [ Jelmer VernooÄ³ ]
  * Add missing space to the error message when only one argument is passed to
    diffoscope.
  [ Holger Levsen ]
  * Update Standards-Version to 4.5.1.
  [ Mattia Rizzolo ]
  * Split the diffoscope package into a diffoscope-minimal package that
    excludes the larger packages from Recommends. (Closes: deb#975261)
  * Drop support for Python 3.6.
- Update to version 161:
  [ Chris Lamb ]
  * Fix failing testsuite: (Closes: deb#972518)
    - Update testsuite to support OCaml 4.11.1. (Closes: deb#972518)
    - Reapply Black and bump minimum version to 20.8b1.
  * Move the OCaml tests to the assert_diff helper.
  [ Jean-Romain Garnier ]
  * Add support for radare2 as a disassembler.
  [ Paul Spooren ]
  * Automatically deploy Docker images in the continuous integration pipeline.
- Update to version 160:
  * Check that pgpdump is actually installed before attempting to run it.
    Thanks to Gianfranco Costamagna (locutusofborg). (Closes: deb#969753)
  * Add some documentation for the EXTERNAL_TOOLS dictionary.
  * Ensure we check FALLBACK_FILE_EXTENSION_SUFFIX, otherwise we run pgpdump
    against all files that are recognised by file(1) as "data".
- Update to version 159:
  [ Chris Lamb ]
  * Show "ordering differences only" in strings(1) output.
    (Closes: reproducible-builds/diffoscope#216)
  * Don't alias output from "os.path.splitext" to variables that we do not end
    up using.
  * Don't raise exceptions when cleaning up after a guestfs cleanup failure.
  [ Jean-Romain Garnier ]
  * Make "Command" subclass a new generic Operation class.
- Update to version 158:
  * Improve PGP support:
    - Support extracting of files within PGP signed data.
      (Closes: reproducible-builds/diffoscope#214)
    - pgpdump(1) can successfully parse some unrelated, non-PGP binary files,
      so check that the parsed output contains something remotely sensible
      before identifying it as a PGP file.
  * Don't use Python's repr(...)-style output in "Calling external command"
    logging output.
  * Correct a typo of "output" in an internal comment.
- Update to version 157:
  [ Chris Lamb ]
  * Try obsensibly "data" files named .pgp against pgpdump to determine whether
    they are PGP files. (Closes: reproducible-builds/diffoscope#211)
  * Don't raise an exception when we encounter XML files with "<!ENTITY>"
    declarations inside the DTD, or when a DTD or entity references an external
    resource. (Closes: reproducible-builds/diffoscope#212)
  * Temporarily drop gnumeric from Build-Depends as it has been removed from
    testing due to Python 2.x deprecation. (Closes: deb#968742)
  * Codebase changes:
    - Add support for multiple file extension matching; we previously supported
      only a single extension to match.
    - Move generation of debian/tests/control.tmp to an external script.
    - Move to our assert_diff helper entirely in the PGP tests.
    - Drop some unnecessary control flow, unnecessary dictionary comprehensions
      and some unused imports found via pylint.
  * Include the filename in the "... not identified by any comparator"
    logging message.
- Update to version 156:
  [ Chris Lamb ]
  * Update PPU tests for compatibility with Free Pascal versions 3.2.0 or
    greater. (Closes: deb#968124)
  * Emit a debug-level logging message when our ppudump(1) version does not
    match file header.
  * Add and use an assert_diff helper that loads and compares a fixture output
    to avoid a bunch of test boilerplate.
  [ Frazer Clews ]
  * Apply some pylint suggestions to the codebase.
- Update to version 155:
  [ Chris Lamb ]
  * Bump Python requirement from 3.6 to 3.7 - most distributions are either
    shipping3.5 or 3.7, so supporting 3.6 is not somewhat unnecessary and also
    more difficult to test locally.
  * Improvements to setup.py:
    - Apply the Black source code reformatter.
    - Add some URLs for the site of PyPI.org.
    - Update "author" and author email.
  * Explicitly support Python 3.8.
  [ Frazer Clews ]
  * Move away from the deprecated logger.warn method logger.warning.
  [ Mattia Rizzolo ]
  * Document ("classify") on PyPI that this project works with Python 3.8.
- Update to version 154:
  [ Chris Lamb ]
  * Add support for F2FS filesystems.
    (Closes: reproducible-builds/diffoscope#207)
  * Allow "--profile" as a synonym for "--profile=-".
  * Add an add_comment helper method so don't mess with our _comments list
    directly.
  * Add missing bullet point in a previous changelog entry.
  * Use "human-readable" over unhyphenated version.
  * Add a bit more debugging around launching guestfs.
  * Profile the launch of guestfs filesystems.
  * Correct adding a comment when we cannot extract a filesystem due to missing
    guestfs module.
- Update to version 153:
  [ Chris Lamb ]
  * Drop some legacy argument styles; --exclude-directory-metadata and
    --no-exclude-directory-metadata have been replaced with
    --exclude-directory-metadata={yes,no}.
  * Code improvements:
    - Make it easier to navigate the main.py entry point.
    - Use a relative import for get_temporary_directory in diffoscope.diff.
    - Rename bail_if_non_existing to exit_if_paths_do_not_exist.
    - Rewrite exit_if_paths_do_not_exist to not check files multiple times.
  * Documentation improvements:
    - CONTRIBUTING.md:
      - Add a quick note about adding/suggesting new options.
      - Update and expand the release process documentation.
      - Add a reminder to regenerate debian/tests/control.
    - README.rst:
      - Correct URL to build job on Jenkins.
      - Clarify and correct contributing info to point to salsa.debian.org.
- Update to version 152:
  [ Chris Lamb ]
  * Bug fixes:
    - Don't require zipnote(1) to determine differences in a .zip file as we
      can use libarchive directly.
  * Reporting improvements:
    - Don't emit "javap not found in path" if it is available in the path but
      it did not result in any actual difference.
    - Fix "... not available in path" messages when looking for Java
      decompilers; we were using the Python class name (eg. "<class
      'diffoscope.comparators.java.Javap'>") over the actual command we looked
      for (eg. "javap").
  * Code improvements:
    - Replace some simple usages of str.format with f-strings.
    - Tidy inline imports in diffoscope.logging.
    - In the RData comparator, always explicitly return a None value in the
      failure cases as we return a non-None value in the "success" one.
  [ Jean-Romain Garnier ]
  * Improve output of side-by-side diffs, detecting added lines better.
    (MR: reproducible-builds/diffoscope!64)
  * Allow passing file with list of arguments to ArgumentParser (eg.
    "diffoscope @args.txt"). (MR: reproducible-builds/diffoscope!62)
- Update to version 151:
  [ Chris Lamb]
  * Improvements and bug fixes:
    - Pass the absolute path when extracting members from SquashFS images as we
      run the command with our working directory set to the temporary
      directory. (Closes: deb#964365, reproducible-builds/diffoscope#189)
    - Increase the minimum length of the output from strings(1) to 8 characters
      to avoid unnecessary diff noise. (Re. reproducible-builds/diffoscope#148)
  * Logging improvements:
    - Fix the compare_files message when the file does not have a literal name.
    - Reduce potential log noise by truncating the has_some_content messages.
  * Codebase changes:
    - Clarify use of a "null" diff in order to remember an exit code.
    - Don't alias a variable when don't end up it; use "_" instead.
    - Use a  "NullChanges" file to represent missing data in the Debian package
      comparator.
    - Update some miscellaneous terms.
- Update to version 150:
  [ Chris Lamb ]
  * Don't crash when listing entries in archives if they don't have a listed
    size (such as hardlinks in .ISO files).
    (Closes: reproducible-builds/diffoscope#188)
  * Dump PE32+ executables (including EFI applications) using objdump.
    (Closes: reproducible-builds/diffoscope#181)
  * Tidy detection of JSON files due to missing call to File.recognizes that
    checks against the output of file(1) which was also causing us to attempt
    to parse almost every file using json.loads. (Whoops.)
  * Drop accidentally-duplicated copy of the new --diff-mask tests.
  * Logging improvements:
    - Split out formatting of class names into a common method.
    - Clarify that we are generating presenter formats in the opening logs.
  [ Jean-Romain Garnier ]
  * Remove objdjump(1) offsets before instructions to reduce diff noise.
    (Closes: reproducible-builds/diffoscope!57)
- Update to version 149:
  [ Chris Lamb ]
  * Update tests for file 5.39. (Closes: reproducible-builds/diffoscope#179)
  * Downgrade the tlsh warning message to an "info" level warning.
    (Closes: deb#888237, reproducible-builds/diffoscope#29)
  * Use the CSS "word-break" property over manually adding U+200B zero-width
    spaces that make copy-pasting cumbersome.
    (Closes: reproducible-builds/diffoscope!53)
  * Codebase improvements:
    - Drop some unused imports from the previous commit.
    - Prevent an unnecessary .format() when rendering difference comments.
    - Use a semantic "AbstractMissingType" type instead of remembering to check
      for both "missing" files and missing containers.
  [ Jean-Romain Garnier ]
  * Allow user to mask/filter reader output via --diff-mask=REGEX.
    (MR: reproducible-builds/diffoscope!51)
  * Make --html-dir child pages open in new window to accommodate new web
    browser content security policies.
  * Fix the --new-file option when comparing directories by merging
    DirectoryContainer.compare and Container.compare.
    (Closes: reproducible-builds/diffoscope#180)
  * Fix zsh completion for --max-page-diff-block-lines.
  [ Mattia Rizzolo ]
  * Do not warn about missing tlsh during tests.
- Update to version 148:
  [ Daniel Fullmer ]
  * Fix a regression in the CBFS comparator due to changes in our_check_output.
  [ Chris Lamb ]
  * Add a remark in the deb822 handling re. potential security issue in the
    .changes, .dsc, .buildinfo comparator.
- Update to version 147:
  [ Chris Lamb ]
  * New features:
    - Add output from strings(1) to ELF binaries. It is intended this will
      expose expose build paths that are hidden somewhere within the objdump(1)
      output. (Closes: reproducible-builds/diffoscope#148)
    - Add basic zsh shell tab-completion support.
      (Closes: reproducible-builds/diffoscope#158)
  * Bug fixes:
    - Prevent a traceback when comparing a PDF document that does not contain
      any metadata, ie. it is missing a PDF "/Info" stanza.
      (Closes: reproducible-builds/diffoscope#150)
    - Fix compatibility with jsondiff 1.2.0 which was causing a traceback and
      log the version of jsondiff we are using to aid debugging in the future.
      (Closes: reproducible-builds/diffoscope#159
    - Fix an issue in GnuPG keybox handling that left filenames in the diff.
    - Don't mask an existing test name; ie. ensure it is actually run.
  * Reporting:
    - Log all calls to subprocess.check_output by using our own wrapper utility.
      (Closes: reproducible-builds/diffoscope#151)
  * Code improvements:
    - Replace references to "WF" with "Wagner-Fischer" for clarity.
    - Drop a large number of unused imports (list_libarchive,
      ContainerExtractionError, etc.)
    - Don't assign exception to a variable that we do not use.
    - Compare string values with the equality operator, not via "is" identity.
    - Don't alias an open file to a variable when we don't use it.
    - Don't alias "filter" builtin.
    - Refactor many small parts of the HTML generation, dropping explicit
      u"unicode" strings, tidying the generation of the "Offset X, Y lines
      modified" messages, moving to PEP 498 f-strings where appropriate, etc.
    - Inline a number of single-used utility methods.
- Update to version 146:
  [ Chris Lamb ]
  * Refactor .changes and .buildinfo handling to show all details (including
    the GPG header and footer components), even when referenced files are not
    present. (Closes: reproducible-builds/diffoscope#122)
  * Normalise filesystem stat(2) "birth times" (ie. st_birthtime) in the same
    way we do with stat(1)'s "Access:" and "Change:" times to fix a
    nondetermistic build failure on GNU Guix.
    (Closes: reproducible-builds/diffoscope#74)
  * Drop the (default) subprocess.Popen(shell=False) keyword argument so that
    the more unsafe shell=True is more obvious.
  * Ignore lower vs. upper-case when ordering our file format descriptions.
  * Don't skip string normalisation in Black.
  [ Mattia Rizzolo ]
  * Add a "py3dist" override for the rpm-python module (Closes: deb#949598)
  * Bump the debhelper compat level to 13 and use the new
    execute_after_*/execture_before_* style rules.
  * Fix a spelling error in changelog.
  [ Daniel Fullmer ]
  * Mount GuestFS filesystem images readonly.
  [ Jean-Romain Garnier ]
  * Prevent an issue where (for example) LibarchiveMember's has_same_content
    method is called regardless of the actual type of file.
- Update to version 145:
  [ Chris Lamb ]
  * Improvements:
    - Add support for Apple Xcode mobile provisioning .mobilepovision files.
      (Closes: reproducible-builds/diffoscope#113)
    - Add support for printing the signatures via apksigner(1).
      (Closes: reproducible-builds/diffoscope#121)
    - Use SHA256 over MD5 when generating page names for the HTML directory
      presenter, validate checksums for files referenced in .changes files
      using SHA256 too, and move to using SHA256 in "Too much input for diff"
      output too. (Closes: reproducible-builds/diffoscope#124)
    - Don't leak the full path of the temporary directory in "Command [..]
      exited with 1".  (Closes: reproducible-builds/diffoscope#126)
    - Identify "iOS App Zip archive data" files as .zip files.
      (Closes: reproducible-builds/diffoscope#116)
  * Bug fixes:
    - Correct "differences" typo in the ApkFile handler.
      (Closes: reproducible-builds/diffoscope#127)
  * Reporting/output improvements:
    - Never emit the same id="foo" TML anchor reference twice, otherwise
      identically-named parts will not be able to linked to via "#foo".
      (Closes: reproducible-builds/diffoscope#120)
    - Never emit HTML with empty "id" anchor lements as it is not possible to
      link to "#" (vs "#foo"). We use "#top" as a fallback value so it will
      work for the top-level parent container.
    - Clarify the message when we cannot find the "debian" Python module.
    - Clarify "Command [..] failed with exit code" to remove duplicate "exited
      with exit" but also to note that diffoscope is interpreting this as an
      error.
    - Add descriptions for the 'fallback' Debian module file types.
    - Rename the --debugger command-line argument to --pdb.
  * Testsuite improvements:
    - Prevent CI (and runtime) apksigner test failures due to lack of
      binfmt_misc on Salsa CI and elsewhere.
  * Codebase improvements:
    - Initially add a pair of comments to tidy up a slightly abstraction level
      violating code in diffoscope.comparators.mising_file and the
      .dsc/.buildinfo file handling, but replace this later by by inlining
      MissingFile's special handling of deb822 to prevent leaking through
      abstraction layers in the first place.
    - Use a BuildinfoFile (etc.) regardless of whether the associated files
      such as the orig.tar.gz and the .deb are present, but don't treat them as
      actual containers. (Re: reproducible-builds/diffoscope#122)
    - Rename the "Openssl" command class to "OpenSSLPKCS7" to accommodate other
      commands with this prefix.
    - Wrap a docstring across multiple lines, drop an inline pprint import and
      comment the HTMLPrintContext class, etc.
  [ Emanuel Bronshtein ]
  * Avoid build-cache in building the released Docker image.
    (Closes: reproducible-builds/diffoscope#123)
  [ Holger Levsen ]
  * Wrap long lines in older changelog entries.
- Update to version 144:
  [ Chris Lamb ]
  * Improvements:
    - Print the amount of free space that we have available in our temporary
      directory as a debugging message.
    - Remove (broken) fuzzy matching of JSON files as file 5.35 (in buster,
      released 2018-10-18) supports recognising JSON data.
      (Closes: reproducible-builds/diffoscope#106)
    - Don't pretty-print the JSON output by default as it will usually be so
      complicated to be unreadable by the human eye and it can be easily
      replaced by piping to "| jq".
    - Don't print a traceback if we pass a single, missing argument to
      diffoscope (eg. a JSON diff to re-load).
  * Reporting/output improvements:
    - Reduce the default number of maximum standard error lines printed from 50
      to 25; usually the error is obvious by that point.
    - Clarify the message when we truncate the number of lines to standard
      error.
    - Clarify when an external command emits for both files, otherwise it can
      look like diffoscope is repeating itself when it is actually being run
      twice.
    - Don't repeat "stderr from {}" if both commands emit the same thing.
  * Dockerfile improvements:
    - Use ARG instead of ENV for DEBIAN_FRONTEND so we do not set this
      environment variable at runtime.
      (Closes: reproducible-builds/diffoscope#103)
    - Run diffoscope as a non-root user in the runtime container.
      (Closes: reproducible-builds/diffoscope#102)
    - Add a .dockerignore file to whitelist files we need in our container.
      Thanks to Emanuel Bronshtein for the original idea.
      (Closes: reproducible-builds/diffoscope#105)
    - Install/remove the build-essential package during build so we can install
      the recommended packages from Git.
  * Testsuite improvements:
    - Include the Black output in the assertion failure too.
    - Update the Black self-test; we don't care about the length of the black
      output, rather whether it has some or, preferably, not.
  * Codebase improvements:
    - Bump the officially required version of Python from 3.5 to 3.6.
      (Closes: reproducible-builds/diffoscope#117)
    - Drop an unused shlex import.
    - Instruct linters to pass over a bare try-except when cleaning up
      temporary files used to extract archives.
    - Format diffoscope/comparators/utils/command.py according to Black
      19.10b0-3.
    - Drop entries from Uploaders that have not uploaded in over three years
      with esteemed thanks for their previous work.
    - Drop .travis.yml; we are using Salsa now and likely would not give
      support for running on Travis CI at this point.
  [ Jelle van der Waa ]
  * Update LLVM diff for LLVM version 10.
  [ Vagrant Cascadian ]
  * Add external tool reference on openssl for GNU Guix.
- Update to version 143:
  * Add support for .p7c and .p7b certificates.
    (Closes: reproducible-builds/diffoscope#94)
  * Add "pdftotext" as a requirement to run the PDF test_metadata text. Special
    thanks to Chocimier/Piotr for the debugging work.
    (Closes: reproducible-builds/diffoscope#99)
  * Improve the documentation of FALLBACK_FILE_TYPE_HEADER_PREFIX and
    FILE_TYPE_HEADER_PREFIX to note that only the first 16 bytes are used.
- Update to version 142:
  [ Chris Lamb ]
  * Render multiline difference comments in a way to show indentation.
    (Closes: reproducible-builds/diffoscope#101)
  * Correct parsing of "./setup.py test --pytest-args ...".
  * Capitalise "Ordering differences only" in text comparison comments.
  * Don't include the JSON similarity percentage if it is 0.0%.
  [ Ben Hutchings ]
  * Document how --exclude arguments are matched against filenames.
  [ Vagrant Cascadian ]
  * Add external tool reference for h5dump on Guix.
- Update to version 141:
  [ Chris Lamb ]
  * Dalvik .dex files can also serve as APK containers. Restrict the narrower
    identification of .dex files to files ending with this extension, and widen
    the identification of APK files to when file(1) discovers a Dalvik file.
    (Closes: deb#884095, reproducible-builds/diffoscope#28)
  * Explicitly list python3-h5py in debian/tests/control.in to ensure that we
    have this module installed during an autopkgtest run to generate the test
    fixture & regenerate debian/tests/control from debian/tests/control.in
    to match.
  * Drop unnecessary and unused assignment to "diff" variable.
  * Strip paths from the output of zipinfo(1) warnings.
    (re. reproducible-builds/diffoscope#97)
  [ Michael Osipov ]
  * Revert to using zipinfo(1) directly instead of piping input via /dev/stdin
    for BSD portability. (Closes: reproducible-builds/diffoscope#97)
  [ Jelle van der Waa ]
  * Add an external tool for h5dump on Arch.
- Update to version 140:
  * apktool 2.5.0 changed the handling of output of XML schemas, so update and
    restrict the corresponding test to match.
    (Closes: reproducible-builds/diffoscope#96)
  * Add support for Hierarchical Data Format (HD5) files.
    (Closes: reproducible-builds/diffoscope#95)
- Update to version 139:
  [ Mattia Rizzolo ]
  * Fix Build-Depends on python3-pdfminer. (Closes: deb#955645)
- Update to version 138:
  * New features & bug fixes:
    - Use dumppdf from python3-pdfminer if we do not see any other differences
      from pdftext, etc. (reproducible-builds/diffoscope#92)
    - Prevent a traceback when comparing two .rdx files directly as get_member
      will return a file even if the file is missing and not raise a KeyError
      exception; we therefore explicitly test for the existence of the file.
    * Don't allow errors within "Rscript" deserialisation to cause the entire
      operation to fail (for example if an external library cannot be loaded).
      (reproducible-builds/diffoscope#91)
  * Reporting improvements:
    - Inject the supported file formats into the package long description and
      remove any duplicate comparator descriptions when formatting.
      (#reproducible-builds/diffoscope#90)
    - Print a potentially-helpful message if the PyPDF2 module is not installed
      (#reproducible-builds/diffoscope#92)
    - Weaken "Install the X package to get a better output" claim to "... may
      produce a better output" as this is not guaranteed.
  * Code improvements:
    - Inline the RequiredToolNotFound.get_package method; only used once.
    - Drop deprecated "py36 = [..]" argument in pyproject.toml.
    - Factor out generation of comparator descriptions.
    - Add an upstream metadata file.
- Update to version 137:
  * Also extract classes2.dex, classes3.dex etc. from .apk files.
    (Closes: reproducible-builds/diffoscope#88)
  * Add generalised support for "ignoring" returncodes and move special-casing
    of returncodes in the zip comparator to this.
  * Accommodate sng returning with a UNIX exit code of 1 even if there minor
    errors in the file (discovered via #950806).
- Update to version 136:
  [ Chris Lamb ]
  * Improvements:
    - Support external build tools. (Closes: reproducible-builds/diffoscope#87)
    - Fallback to the regular .zip container format for .apk files if apktool
      is not available.
    - Clarify that "install X" in difference comment messages actually refer to
      a system/distribution package.
    - Drop the --max-report-size-child and --max-diff-block-lines-parent
      options; both deprecated and scheduled for removal in January 2018.
  * Bug fixes:
    - No longer raise a KeyError exception if we request an invalid member from
      a directory container.
  * Logging improvements:
    - Log a debug-level message if we cannot open a file as container due to a
      missing tool in order to assist diagnosing issues.
    - If we don't know the HTML output name, don't emit an enigmatic "html
      output for" message.
    - Add the current PATH environment variable to the "Normalising locale..."
      debug-level message.
    - Print the "Starting diffoscope $VERSION" line as the first line.
    - Correct a debug-level message for compare_meta calls to quote the
      arguments correctly.
  * Refactoring:
    - Add support for alternative container types for a file, allowing for
      runtime (vs import time) control of fallbacks such as adding comments.
      and append a comment to a difference if we fallback to an inferior
      container format due to missing a tool.
    - Factor-out the generation of "foo not available in path" difference
      comment messages as a helper method in the exception that represents
      them.
  * Code improvements:
    - Tidy diffoscope.main's configure method, factoring out the set of the
      Config() global out of the run_diffoscope method and inlining the
      functionality of maybe_set_limit, etc.
    - Rename diffoscope.locale module to diffoscope.environ as we are modifying
      things beyond just the locale (eg. calling tzset(), etc.)
    - Drop unused "Difference" import from the APK comparator.
    - Drop an assertion that is guaranteed by parallel "if" conditional.
    - Add a "noqa" line to avoid a false-positive flake8 "unused import"
      warning.
    - Turn down the "volume" for a recommendation in a comment.
  * Release/source-code management:
    - Add a .git-blame-ignore-revs file to improve the output of git-blame(1) by
      ignoring large changes when introducing the Black source code reformatter
      and update the CONTRIBUTING.md guide on how to optionally use it locally.
    - Convert CONTRIBUTING.rst to CONTRIBUTING.md and include it in the
      PyPI.org release.
  * Test improvements
    - Refresh and update the fixtures for the .ico tests to match the latest
      version of Imagemagick in Debian unstable.
  [ Holger Levsen ]
  * Bump Standards Version to 4.5.0, no changes needed.
  [ Marc Herbert ]
  * Search for expected keywords in the output of cbfstool tests and not a
    specific output. (Closes: reproducible-builds/diffoscope!42)
- Update to version 135:
  [ Chris Lamb ]
  * Extract resources.arsc files (as well as classes.dex) from Android .apk
    files to ensure that we at least show differences there. (Closes: deb#916359)
  * Always pass a filename with a ".zip" extension to zipnote otherwise it
    will return with an exit code of 9 and revert to a binary diff for the
    entire file.
  * Don't exhaustively output the entire HTML report when testing the
    regression for #875281; parsing the JSON and pruning the tree should be
    enough.
  * Factor out running all of our zipinfo variants into a new method and use
    this routine when comparing .apk files, thus now also displaying any
    differences exposed by bsdtar.
  * Testsuite improvements:
    - Always allow fixtures called "output*".
    - Actually test the output of the test_html_regression_875281 test.
  * Add a note to the "Contributing" page to suggest enable concurrency when
    running the tests locally.
  [ Marc Herbert ]
  * Fix a misplaced debug "Loading diff from stdin" logging message.
  * Add new "Testing" section to CONTRIBUTING.rst.
- Update to version 134:
  [ Chris Lamb ]
  * Ensure that autopkgtests are run with our pyproject.toml present for the
    correct "black" source code formatter settings. (Closes: deb#945993)
  * Tidy some unnecessary boolean logic in the ISO9660 tests.
  * Rename the "text_option_with_stdiout" to "text_option_with_stdout".
  * Include the libarchive file listing for ISO images to ensure that
    timestamps (not just dates) are visible in any difference.
    (Closes: reproducible-builds/diffoscope#81)
  [ Eli Schwartz ]
  * Fix an exception in the progressbar handler.
  [ Vagrant Cascadian ]
  * Add an external tool reference for zstd on GNU Guix.
- Update to version 133:
  * Correct the substitution/filtering of paths in ELF output to avoid
    unnecessary differences depending on the path name provided on the
    commandline. (Closes: deb#945572)
  * Silence/correct a SyntaxWarning message due to incorrectly comparing an
    integer by identity (is) over equality (==). (Closes: deb#945531)
- Update to version 132:
  * Allow all possible .zip variations to return with non-zero exit codes, not
    just known types we can explicitly identify (eg. Java .jmod and .jar
    files). (Closes: reproducible-builds/diffoscope#78)
  * Also permit UTF-8 encoded .dsc and .changes files.
    (Re: reproducible-builds/diffoscope#78)
  * Rework a long string of "or" statements into a loop with a "break".
- Update to version 131:
  * Clarify in the HTML and text outputs that the limits are per output format,
    not global. (Closes: deb#944882, reproducible-builds/diffoscope#76)
    - Bump the previous "max_page_size" limit from 400 kB to 4 MB.
  * Update an Android manifest test to reflect that parsed XML attributes are
    returned in a sorted or otherwise novel manner under Python 3.8.
  * Update code to reflect version 19.10b0 of the black source code
    reformatter and don't run our self-test for versions earlier than this as
    it will generate different results and thus fail.
  * Limit .dsc and .buildinfo matching; don't attempt to compare them as
    ELF sections or similar. (Closes: reproducible-builds/diffoscope#77)
  * Add a comment that the text_ascii{1,2} test fixture files are used in
    multiple places so are not trivial to generate on the fly.
- Update to version 130:
  [ Chris Lamb ]
  * debian/tests/basic-command-line:
    Move from deprecated ADTTMP to AUTOPKGTEST_TMP.
  * Correct the matching of R .rds files by also detecting newer versions
    of this file format.
  * Drop unused BASE_DIR global in the tests.
  * Try and ensure that new test data files are generated dynamically, ie.
    at least no new ones are added without "good" reasons.
  * Truncate the tcpdump expected diff to 8KB (from ~600KB).
  * Refresh OCaml test fixtures to support OCaml >= 4.08.1.  Closes: deb#944709
  * Correct reference to the ".rdx" extension in a comment.
  * Update XML test for Python 3.8+.
  * Don't use line-base dbuffering when communucating with subprocesses
    in binary mode. (Closes: reproducible-builds/diffoscope#75)
  [ Jelle van der Waa ]
  * Add support for comparing .zst files are created by zstd.
    (Closes: reproducible-builds/diffoscope!34)
- Update to version 129:
  * Call R's "deparse" function to ensure that we do not error out and revert
    to a binary diff when processing .rdb files with internal "vector" types as
    they do not automatically coerce to strings.
  * Add the ability to pass Python bytestrings to external commands and
    pass our long script to parse R .rdb files using this new method over a
    long command-line argument
  * Use Rscript's --vanilla option over --no-environ as this also enables
    --no-save, --no-restore, --no-site-file and --no-init-file.
  * Improve command-line error messages:
    - Split out formatting into a separate utility function.
    - Truncate very long lines when displaying them as an external source
      of data.
    - When printing an error from a command, format the command for the user.
  * Use "exit code" over "return code" when referring to UNIX error codes in
    displayed differences.
- Update to version 128:
  * Query the container for the full path of the parallel R .rdx file for a
    .rdb file as well as looking in the same directory. This ensures that
    comparing two .deb/.changes files shows a varying path introduced in
    version 127.
- Update to version 127:
  [ Chris Lamb ]
  * Move build-dependency on python-argcomplete to the Python 3.x version to
    facilitate Python 2.x removal. (Closes: deb#942967)
  * Overhaul the handling of GNU R .rdb files:
    - Rework and refactor the handling of .rdb files specifically with respect
      to locating the parallel .rdx file prior to inspecting the file to ensure
      that we do not add files to the user's filesystem in the case of directly
      comparing two .rdb files or, worse, overwriting a file in is place.
    - Use a ("""-formatted) docstring for our internal R script to dump
      variables.
    - Mask/hide standard errors; R will often produce noisy output that is not
      useful to us.
    - Don't include a useless and misleading "NULL".
    - Include all R object names are displayed, including ones beginning with a
      fullstop (".").
    - Sort package fields when dumping data for output stability.
    - Format package contents as "foo = bar" rather than using ugly and
      misleading brackets.
    - Include the object's type when dumping package contents.
    - Never read the site or user's R location environment configuration to
      ensure output stability.
    - Expose absolute paths in the semantic/human-readable output, preventing
      falling back to a useless hexdump.
  * Improve the formatting of command lines:
    - Ensure newlines and other metacharacters appear escaped as "\n", etc.
    - Use the newline (etc.) escaped version of the commandline being executed
      in logging/debug output.
    - When displaying standard error, ensure use the escaped version too.
  * Add support for easily masking the standard error of commands and use this
    in the ffprobe comparator.
  * To match the libarchive container, raise a KeyError exception if we request
    an invalid member from a directory container.
  * Correct string representation output in the traceback when we cannot locate
    a specific item in a container.
  [ Mattia Rizzolo ]
  * Run Debian autopkgtests against all Python versions.
- Update to version 126:
  [ Chris Lamb ]
  * Track and report on missing Python modules.
    (Closes: reproducible-builds/diffoscope#72)
  * Drop some unnecessary control flow.
  * Drop explicit inheriting from 'object' class; unnecessary in Python 3.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 4.4.1.
  [ Mattia Rizzolo ]
  * Exit with 2 instead of 1 in case of no disk space.
- Update to version 125:
  * The test_libmix_differences ELF test requires xxd. (Closes: deb#940645)
- Update to version 124:
  [ Chris Lamb ]
  * Also conditionally skip the identification and "no differences" tests as we
    require the Ocaml compiler to be present when building the test files
    themselves. (Closes: deb#940471)
  [ Mattia Rizzolo ]
  * Permit all sorts of version suffixes when checking the Debian package
    version matches setup.py, not just for backports. (Closes: deb#939387)
  [ Vagrant Cascadian ]
  * Add external tools on GNU Guix for odt2txt, sng and pgpdump.
  [ Marc Herbert ]
  * Remove StaticLibFile in the ELF comparator -- ArFile.compare_details() is
    superior. (Closes: reproducible-builds/diffoscope#64)
- Update to version 123:
  [ Chris Lamb ]
  * Build OCaml test input files on-demand rather than shipping them with the
    package in order to prevent test failures with OCaml 4.08.
    (Closes: deb#939386)
  * Update test skipping messages:
    - When skipping tests due to the lack of installed tool, print the package
      that may provide it.
    - Update "requires foo module" messages to clarify that they are regarding
      Python modules, not packages.
  * Rebuild the test squashfs images to exclude the character device as they
    requires root or fakeroot to extract. (reproducible-builds/diffoscope#65)
  * Remove accidentally-committed test fixture generation code from tests.
  * Set long_description_content_type to 'text/x-rst' in setup.py to appease
    the PyPI.org linter.
  [ Mattia Rizzolo ]
  * Don't crash when the progress is requested but the Python module is
    missing. (Closes: deb#939085)
  [ Vagrant Cascadian ]
  * Add external tools for gifbuild, javap and kbxutil in GNU Guix.
  [ Marc Herbert ]
  * In the cbfs tests, add a "Comp" column test to support Coreboot
    utils > 4.6.
- Update to version 122:
  [ Chris Lamb ]
  * Apply patch from LÃ¡szlÃ³ BÃ¶szÃ¶rmÃ©nyi to update the squashfs test output and
    bump the required version for the test itself. (Closes: deb#935684)
  * Skip calls to unsquashfs when we are not root or fakeroot.
    (Re: reproducible-builds/diffoscope#63)
  * Include either standard error or standard output (and not just the latter)
    if/when an external command fails.
  * Fix a few unicode/bytes issues:
    - Avoid a possible traceback caused by a str/bytes confusion when handling
      the output of failing external commands.
    - Ensure that all of our artificially-created subprocess.CalledProcessError
      instances have `output` instances that are bytes objects, not str.
  * Improve debugging output:
    * Add the containing module name to the (eg.) "Using StaticLibFile for ..."
    * Improve and condense output when creating our Comparator object types.
  * Correct a reference to `parser.diff` as `diff` in this context is a Python
    function in the module, not the actual output returned from diff(1).
  * Add the "wabt" Debian package to the test dependencies so that we run the
    wasm tests.
  [ Mattia Rizzolo ]
  * Now that we test-require wabt, expect that its tools to be available during
    autopkgtests.
- Update to version 121:
  * Don't fallback to a (useless) raw hexdump when readelf(1) reports an minor
    issue in a section in an ELF binary. For example, when the "frames" section
    is of the "NOBITS" type, its contents are apparently "unreliable" and thus
    readelf(1) exits with a returncode of 1. (Closes: deb#849407, #931962)
  * Add support to Difference.from_command_exc and friends to optionally ignore
    specified returncodes from the called program and treat them as "no"
    difference.
  * Simplify the parsing of the optional "command_args" argument to the
    from_command and from_command_exc methods in the Difference class.
- Update to version 120:
  * No-change sourceful after accidentally uploading binaries in order to
    migration to testing.
- Update to version 119:
  [ Chris Lamb ]
  * If a command fails to execute but does not print anything to standard
    error, try and include the first line of standard output in the message we
    include in the diff. This was motivated by readelf(1) returning its error
    messages on stdout. (Closes: deb#931963)
  * Add support for Java ".jmod" modules. Not all versions of file(1) support
    detection of Jmod files yet, so we perform a manual comparison instead.
    (Closes: deb#933308)
  * Re-add "return code" noun to "Command `foo` exited with X" error messages.
  * Factor out the ability to ignore the exit codes of "zipinfo" and
    "zipinfo -v" in the presence of non-standard headers.
  * Only override the exit code from our special-cased calls to zipinfo(1) if
    they are 1 or 2 to avoid potentially masking real errors.
  * Also add missing textual description entries for ZipFile and
    MozillaZipFile file types.
  * Skip extra newline in "Output:\n<none>".
  * Cease ignoring test failures in stable-backports.
  * Bump debhelper compat level to 12.
  [ Marc Herbert ]
  * Catch failures to disassemble and rescue all other differences.
    (Closes: reproducible-builds/diffoscope!29)
- Update to version 118:
  * Don't fail in autopkgtests when, for example, we do not have sufficiently
    newer or older version of file. (Closes: deb#931881)
  * Also include python3-tlsh in test dependencies.
  * Tidy handling of DIFFOSCOPE_FAIL_TESTS_ON_MISSING_TOOLS:
    - Merge two previously-overlapping environment variables.
    - Use repr(..)-style output when printing test status.
    - Add some explicit return values to appease pylint.
- Update to version 117:
  [ Chris Lamb ]
  * Add support for file 5.37. Thanks again to Christoph Biedl for the heads-up
    in advance. (Closes: reproducible-builds/diffoscope/#57)
  * Apply patch from Gianfranco Costamagna to fix autopkgtest failures in
    Debian. (Closes: deb#931709)
  [ Holger Levsen ]
  * debian/control: Bump Standards-Version to 4.4.0.
- Update to version 116:
  [ Chris Lamb ]
  * Upload to unstable after the release of Debian "buster".
  * README.rst & manual page generation:
    - Strip out manpage-only parts of the README rather than using "only"
      reStructuredText directives in order to support the demands of the latest
      PyPI website.
    - Use "real" reStructuredText comments instead of using the "raw" directive.
  * Dockerfile:
    - Build the Docker image from the current Git checkout, not the Debian
      archive. (reproducible-builds/diffoscope#56)
    - Use the ENTRYPOINT directive with the JSON syntax instead so we pass all
      arguments to the underlying diffoscope executable.
  * Document that run_diffoscope should not be considered a stable API.
  [ Mattia Rizzolo ]
  * Rename a test function to prevent shadowing a previous one with the
    same name.
  * Add ffmpeg to the list of Debian build-dependencies for the testsuite.
  [ Vagrant Cascadian ]
  * Add support for known external tools in GNU Guix.
- Update to version 115):
  [ Chris Lamb ]
  * Fix execution of symbolic links that point to the "bin/diffoscope" entry
    point by fully resolving the location.
  * Add a Dockerfile.
  * Update contributing messages with instructions regarding the Docker image.
  [ Mattia Rizzolo ]
  * tests:
    + Allow specifying which tools are known missing using
    DIFFOSCOPE_TESTS_MISSING_TOOLS, to override a _FAIL_ON_MISSING_TOOLS.
    + With DIFFOSCOPE_TESTS_FAIL_ON_MISSING_TOOLS=1, actually fail only tests
      that are missing the required tools.
  * debian:
    + Add black to the test dependencies.
    + Enforce the "fail on missing tools" only when testing with all the
      recommended packages.
    + Ack some missing tools during autopkgtest.
    + Reinstate oggvideotools and procyon-decompiler test dependencies,
      now that are not buggy anymore.
- Update to version 114):
  [ Chris Lamb ]
  * Add support for GnuPG "keybox" files. Thanks to Daniel Kahn Gillmor for the
    suggestion. (Closes: deb#871244, reproducible-builds/diffoscope#23)
  * Always warn if tlsh module is not available (not just if a specific
    fuzziness threshold is specified) to match the epilog of the --help output.
    This prevents missing support for file rename detection.
    (Closes: deb#888237, reproducible-builds/diffoscope#29)
  * Treat missing tools on Debian autopkgtests as individual test failures by
    checking whether a new DIFFOSCOPE_TESTS_FAIL_ON_MISSING_TOOLS environment
    variable is exported. (Closes: deb#905885, reproducible-builds/diffoscope#35)
  * Require that "-" is explicitly specified to read a single diff from
    standard input to avoid non-intuitive behaviour when diffoscope is called
    without any arguments. (Closes: reproducible-builds/diffoscope#54)
  * Make --use-dbgsym a ternary operator to make it easier to totally disable.
    Thanks to Mattia Rizzolo for the suggestion.
  * Consolidate on "e" as the aliased exception name.
  [ Milena Boselli Rosa ]
  * Various fixes to the HTML markup to prevent validation warnings/errors:
    - Prevent empty values for the "name" attribute name on HTML anchor tags,
      and add an "id" to its parent "div" container.
    - Fix "table column x established by element 'col' has no cells beginning
      in it" warnings.
    - Fix "Text run is not in Unicode Normalization Form C".
    - Remove the "type" HTML attribute from <style> elements.
  [ Vibhu ]
  * Fail more gracefully when running out of diskspace. (Closes: deb#874582)

      find differences. Thanks to Hans-Christoph Steiner for the report.
      (Closes: deb#890904)
    - Recursively reset the permissions of temporary directories prior to
      deletion to ensure that non-writable permissions such as 0555 are removed

      using ambiguous `l` variable names.
    - Add whitespace around operators and ensure 4-line indentation throughout.
  * debian/*:
    - Move DOS/MBR check into the testsuite.
    - Add explicit runtime dependency on python3-distutils as it was dropped in

- update to version 49:
  * Don't crash when we can't find the debug file in a matching debug
    package.  This repairs diffoscope for xserver-xorg and other
    packages.
  * Use libarchive to read metadata from ar archives. The output is
    more precise and less dependent on binutils version. The command
    line `ar` tool is not used any more so remove it from the required
    tools.
  * Split readelf --debug-dump output when examining ELF files. Based
    on a patch by Dhole.
  * Keep both .debug_str and .zdebug_str as ElfSection. Thanks to
    Niels Thykier for noticing the problem.
  * Fix a logic error in _install_debug_symbols. Thanks anthraxx for
    the report and the fix.
  * Use recursive containers for directory and only look at files with
    ending in .deb when looking for Build IDs. Both avoid looking at
    too many files when searching for matching debug packages. Thanks
    Helmut Grohne and Steven Chamberlain for the reports and
    tests. (Closes: deb#813052)
  * Add support for ICC profiles. This adds a Recommends on colord in
    Debian.
  * Harmonize spaces and commas in package list.
  * Update PPU files test data for FPC 3.0.0.
  * Update exepcted javap output for OpenJDK 1.8.
  * Stop specializing files from directories earlier than necessary.
  * Adding cd-iccdump package reference for Arch Linux.
  * Use HTTPS in Vcs-Git.
  * Bump standards version to 3.9.7, no changes needed.
