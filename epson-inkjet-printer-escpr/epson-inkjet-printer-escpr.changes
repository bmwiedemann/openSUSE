  RPM Provides tags for the printers supported by

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb  8 12:39:53 CET 2012 - jsmeix@suse.de

- Upgraded to version 1.1.1:
  Provided '1284DeviceID' attributes in the PPD files.
  Several more supported devices (WP 4010/4023/4520/4533 series).
  A few bug fixes (in particular for PX-B700 and PX-B750F devices).

- Use traditional bash scriptlets for post/postun with
  an explicite "exit 0" line at the end to be fail safe
  and therefore also "PreReq: /sbin/ldconfig" explicitly.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct  4 09:55:34 CEST 2011 - jsmeix@suse.de

- Using "-p /sbin/ldconfig" option in post/postun
  see the "Shared_libraries" section in
  http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Packaging_scriptlet_snippets
  Have the comment for the files section inside the files section
  and not directly before it because then this comment actually
  belongs for RPM to the section before the files section and
  when this is "postun -p /sbin/ldconfig", the comment becomes
  in some cases (e.g. in the build system for SLE11 and SLE11_SP1)
  added as argument to the /sbin/ldconfig call which lets it fail
  with an "/sbin/ldconfig: relative path ... used to build cache"
  which lets package build fail during "removing all built rpms".
  Therefore traditional bash scriptlets for post/postun
  with an "exit 0" line at the end would be more fail safe
  but using "-p /sbin/ldconfig" is requested to get the package
  accepted for openSUSE:Factory (a.k.a. openSUSE 12.1).
