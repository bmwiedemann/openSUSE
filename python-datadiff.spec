%description
DataDiff is a library to provide human-readable diffs of python data structures.
It can handle sequence types (lists, tuples, etc), sets, and dictionaries.
Dictionaries and sequences will be diffed recursively, when applicable.
It has special-case handling for multi-line strings, showing them as a typical unified diff.
Drop-in replacements for some nose assertions are available.  If the assertion fails,
a nice data diff is shown, letting you easily pinpoint the root difference.
