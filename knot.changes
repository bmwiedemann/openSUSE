        * Dropping identical records in zone and incoming transfers.
        * Support for '/' in zone names.
        * Generating journal from reloaded zone (EXPERIMENTAL).
        * Outgoing-only interfaces in configuration file.
        * Following DNAME if the synthetized name is in the same zone.
        * Signing SOA with TSIG queries when checking zone version with master.
        * Improved compression of packets. Out-of-zone dnames present in RDATA
          were not compressed.
        * Slave zones are now automatically refreshed after startup.
        * Proper response to IXFR/UDP query (returns SOA in Authority section).

    Bugfixes:
        * Crash when zone contained RRSIG signing a CNAME, but did not
          contain the CNAME.
        * Malformed packets parsing.
        * Failed IXFR caused memory leaks.
        * Failed IXFR might have resulted in inconsistent zone structures.
        * Fixed answering to +dnssec queries when NSEC3 chain is corrupted.
        * Fixed answering when transitioning from NSEC3 to NSEC.
        * Fixed answering when zone contains multiple NSEC3 chains.
        * Handling RRSets with different TTLs - TTL from the first RR is used.
        * Synchronization of zone reload and zone transfers.
        * Fixed build on NetBSD 5 and FreeBSD.
        * Fixed binding to both IPv4 and IPv6 at the same time on special
          interfaces.
        * Fixed access rights of created files.
        * Semantic checks corrupted RDATA domain names which are covered by
          wildcard in the same zone.

          and APL records.
        * Fixed possible leak on server shutdown with a pending transfer.
        * Syncing journal to zone was not updating the compiled zone database.
        * Crash after IXFR in certain cases when adding RRSIG in an IXFR.
        * Fixed behaviour when incoming IXFR removes a zone cut. Previously
          occluded names now become properly visible. Previously lead to a
          crash when the server was asked for the previously occluded name.
        * Fixed handling of zero-length strings in text zone dump. Caused the
          compilation to fail.
        * Fixed TSIG algorithm name comparison - the names should be in
          canonical form.
        * Fixed handling unknown RR types with type less than 251.

    Other improvements:
        * IXFR-in optimized.
        * Many zones loading optimized.
        * More detailed log messages (mostly transfer-related).
        * Copying Question section to error responses.
        * Using zone name from config file as default origin in zone file.
        * Additional records are now added to response also from
          wildcard-covered names.
        * Improved user manual.
        * Better checks of corrupted zone database.
