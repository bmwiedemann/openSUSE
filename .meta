  <title>LZOP is a fast File Compressor</title>
  <description>lzop is a file compressor similar to gzip. Its main advantages over gzip are much higher compression and decompression speed at the cost of compression ratio.

lzop was designed with the following goals in mind:
- speed (both compression and decompression)
- reasonable drop-in compatibility to gzip
- portability</description>
