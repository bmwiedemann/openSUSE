  <title>Automatically Give Your Module the Ability to Have Plug-ins</title>
  <description>This package is based on the package 'perl-Module-Pluggable' from project 'openSUSE:Factory'.

Provides a simple but, hopefully, extensible way of having 'plug-ins'
for your module. Obviously, this is not going to be the best possible
of solutions but it is convenient at the moment.

Essentially all it does is to export a method into your namespace that
looks through a search path for .pm files and turns those into class
names.

Optionally, it instantiates those classes for you.
