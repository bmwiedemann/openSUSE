  <title>Accurately serializes a Data Structure as Perl Code</title>
  <description>Given a list of scalars or reference variables, writes out their contents in
perl syntax. The references can also be objects. The contents of each variable
is output using the least number of Perl statements as convenient, usually only
one. Self-referential structures, closures, and objects are output correctly.

The return value can be evaled to get back an identical copy of the original
reference structure. In some cases this may require the use of utility subs
that Data::Dump::Streamer will optionally export.

This module is very similar in concept to the core module Data::Dumper, with
the major differences being that this module is designed to output to a stream
instead of constructing its output in memory (trading speed for memory), and
that the traversal over the data structure is effectively breadth first versus
the depth first traversal done by the others.

In fact the data structure is scanned twice, first in breadth first mode to
perform structural analysis, and then in depth first mode to actually produce
the output, but obeying the depth relationships of the first pass.
