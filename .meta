  <title>Random C program generator</title>
  <description>Csmith is a tool that can generate random C programs that statically and dynamically conform to the C99 standard. It is useful for stress-testing compilers, static analyzers, and other tools that process C code. Csmith has found bugs in every tool that it has tested, and we have used it to find and report more than 400 previously-unknown compiler bugs.</description>
