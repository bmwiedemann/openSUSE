  <title>Make NEXT suck less</title>
  <description>This module is intended as a drop-in replacement for NEXT, supporting the same interface, but using Class::C3 to do the hard work. You can then write new code without NEXT, and migrate individual source files to use Class::C3 or method modifiers as appropriate, at whatever pace you're comfortable with.</description>
