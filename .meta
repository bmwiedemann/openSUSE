  <description>This is a fork of pyzeroconf, a Multicast DNS Service Discovery for Python.
It is compatible with Bonjour and Avahi.
Compared to some other Zeroconf/Bonjour/Avahi Python packages, python-zeroconf
is not tied to Bonjour or Avahi, does not use D-Bus and does not force you to
use a particular event loop or python-twisted.</description>
