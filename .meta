  <title>Junos 'EZ' automation for non-programmers</title>
  <description>Junos PyEZ is designed to provide the same capabilities as a user would have
on the Junos CLI, but in an environment built for automation tasks.
These capabilities include, but are not limited to:

 - Remote connectivity and management of Junos devices via NETCONF
 - Provide &quot;facts&quot; about the device
 - Retrieve &quot;operational&quot; or &quot;run-state&quot; information
 - Retrieve configuration information
 - Make configuration changes in unstructured and structured ways
 - Provide common utilities for tasks such as secure copy of files and
   software updates
