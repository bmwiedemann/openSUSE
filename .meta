  <title>Molecular Dynamics Simulator</title>
  <description>LAMMPS is a classical molecular dynamics code, and an acronym for Large-scale 
Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator.

LAMMPS has potentials for soft materials (biomolecules, polymers) and 
solid-state materials (metals, semiconductors) and coarse-grained or 
mesoscopic systems. It can be used to model atoms or, more generically, as a 
parallel particle simulator at the atomic, meso, or continuum scale.

LAMMPS runs on single processors or in parallel using message-passing 
techniques and a spatial-decomposition of the simulation domain. The code is 
designed to be easy to modify or extend with new functionality.
