  <title>Perl extension for reading MS Excel 2007 files;</title>
  <description>This module is a (quick and dirty) emulation of Spreadsheet::ParseExcel for
Excel 2007 (.xlsx) file format. It supports styles and many of Excel's
quirks, but not all. It populates the classes from Spreadsheet::ParseExcel
for interoperability; including Workbook, Worksheet, and Cell.</description>
