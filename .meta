  <title>Minimal XML parser (Perl module)</title>
  <description>XML::Bare - A minimal XML parser that uses C to generate a folded perl
hash.

This package implements XML as the author thinks it should be, not as
the standard says. Means this parser is not XML conform. So be very
careful if you use this package, the result does not need to be the one
you would expect.</description>
