  <title>Filter to Convert Kanji Characters to Hiragana, Katakana, or Romaji</title>
  <description>KAKASI is the language processing filter to convert Kanji characters to
Hiragana, Katakana, or Romaji(1) and may be helpful for reading
Japanese documents. The word-splitting patch is merged from version
2.3.0.

The name &quot;KAKASI&quot; is the abbreviation of &quot;kanji kana simple inverter&quot;
and the inverse of SKK &quot;simple kana kanji converter&quot; developed by
Masahiko Sato at Tohoku University. Most entries of the kakasi
dictionary are derived from the SKK dictionaries. If interested  in the
naming of KAKASI, consult a Japanese-English dictionary.

(1) &quot;Romaji&quot; is an alphabetical description of Japanese pronunciation.</description>
