  <title>Lightweight HTTP implementation</title>
  <description>HTTP::Lite is a stand-alone lightweight HTTP/1.1 implementation
for perl.

It is not intended as a replacement for the fully-features LWP module. Instead,
it is intended for use in situations where it is desirable to install the
minimal number of modules to achieve HTTP support, or where LWP is not a good
candidate due to CPU overhead, such as slower processors.

HTTP::Lite is also significantly faster than LWP.

HTTP::Lite is ideal for CGI (or mod_perl) programs or for bundling for
redistribution with larger packages where only HTTP GET and POST functionality
are necessary.
