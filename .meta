  <title>A wrapper for dns name resolving or dns faking</title>
  <description>resolv_wrapper makes it possible on most UNIX platforms to contact your own DNS
implmentation in your test environment. It requires socket_wrapper to be able
to contact it.  If it doesnâ€™t work on a special platform the wrapper is able to
fake DNS queries and return valid responses to your application.

This package doesn't have a devel package cause this project is for
development/testing.
