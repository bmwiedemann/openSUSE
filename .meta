  <title>Optional static typing for Python</title>
  <description>Add type annotations to your Python programs, and use mypy to type
check them. Mypy is essentially a Python linter on steroids, and it
can catch many programming errors by analyzing your program, without
actually having to run it. Mypy has a powerful type system with
features such as type inference, gradual typing, generics and union
types.
