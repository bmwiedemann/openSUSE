  <description>vkQuake is a Quake 1 port using Vulkan instead of OpenGL for rendering. It is based on the popular QuakeSpasm port and runs all mods compatible with it like Arcane Dimensions or In The Shadows.

Compared to QuakeSpasm vkQuake also features a software Quake like underwater effect, has better color precision, generates mipmap for water surfaces at runtime and has native support for anti-aliasing and AF.

vkQuake also serves as a Vulkan demo application that shows basic usage of the API. For example it demonstrates render passes &amp; sub passes, pipeline barriers &amp; synchronization, compute shaders, push &amp; specialization constants, CPU/GPU parallelism and memory pooling.</description>
