  <title>Realtime Policy and Watchdog Daemon</title>
  <description>RealtimeKit is a D-Bus system service that changes the
scheduling policy of user processes/threads to SCHED_RR (i.e. realtime
scheduling mode) on request. It is intended to be used as a secure
mechanism to allow real-time scheduling to be used by normal user
processes.</description>
