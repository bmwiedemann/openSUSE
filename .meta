  <title>Lightning-fast URL fetcher</title>
  <description>Furl is yet another HTTP client library. LWP is the de facto standard HTTP
client for Perl5, but it is too slow for some critical jobs, and too
complex for weekend hacking. Furl resolves these issues. Enjoy it!
This library is an alpha software. Any API may change without notice.
