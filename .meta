  <title>Various cryptographic hashes for bytestrings; CRC32 and Adler32 for now</title>
  <description>This package provides efficient cryptographic hash implementations for strict and
lazy bytestrings. For now, CRC32 and Adler32 are supported; they are implemented
as FFI bindings to efficient code from zlib.</description>
