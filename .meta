  <title>A Library for Posting Electronic Mail</title>
  <description>libESMTP is a library to manage posting (or submission of) electronic
mail using SMTP to a preconfigured Mail Transport Agent (MTA) such as
Exim. It may be used as part of a Mail User Agent (MUA) or another
program that must be able to post electronic mail but where mail
functionality is not that program's primary purpose.</description>
