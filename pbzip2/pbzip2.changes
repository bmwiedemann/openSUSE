-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov 03 08:28:13 UTC 2011 - pascal.bleser@opensuse.org

- update to 1.1.6:
  * fixed bug - deadlock due to unsynchronized broadcasts (bug #876686)
  * prevent deletion of input files on error (bug #874543)
  * document how to compress/decompress from standard input (bug #820525)
  * added more detailed kernel error messages (bug #874605)
  * error-handling fixes for multi-archive scenarios (bug #883782)
- use original upstream format archive .gz instead of .bz2 to avoid any
  potential chicken/egg (requires bzip2 to uncompress the pbzip2 sources)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul 21 01:14:35 UTC 2011 - pascal.bleser@opensuse.org

- update to 1.1.5:
  * SECURITY FIX: fixes excessive output permissions while compress/decompress
    is in progress; it now emulates the same behaviour as bzip2

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr 27 22:06:59 UTC 2011 - pascal.bleser@opensuse.org

- update to 1.1.4:
  * fixes a hang on decompress with --ignore-trailing-garbage=1 when producer
    is interrupted on trailing garbage
  * adds an example to help for decompression piped to tar
  * fixes a typo in the Trailing Garbage printed message

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 29 00:05:13 UTC 2011 - pascal.bleser@opensuse.org

- update to 1.1.3:
  * fixes a hang on decompress with --ignore-trailing-garbage=1 when using more
    than 2 CPUs
  * the default extension on decompress of .tbz2 has been changed to .tar for
    bzip2 compatibility
  * trailing garbage errors will now be printed even when in quiet mode

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Feb 19 23:02:36 UTC 2011 - pascal.bleser@opensuse.org

- update to 1.1.2:
  * modifies Consumer_decompress throttling to prevent potential 
    deadlock/infinite loops in certain situations
  * fixes a deadlock bug and performance issue when consumer is working with 
    long bzip2 sequences
  * fixes a bug which caused a hang while decompressing a prematurely truncated 
    bzip2 stream
  * fixes a hang on decompression of some truncated archives
  * adds --ignore-trailing-garbage for non-standard archives such as gentoo 
    packages
- reformatted changes file

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec 20 18:45:09 UTC 2010 - pascal.bleser@opensuse.org

- reverting to upstream release, changed version to 1.1.0+0 to be newer than 
  1.1.0_git...
- add patches:
  * pbzip2-makefile.patch: adds support for BINDIR, MANDIR, DESTDIR and 
    OPTFLAGS
  * pbzip2-fix_printf_format.patch: fix the many printf format errors in debug 
    and error reporting statements
  * pbzip2-fix_unused_result.patch: fix not using the result value of fwrite()
- replace macros.pbzip2 with macros.pbzip2.in and a placeholder to inject the 
  build time value of %{_bindir}
- add symbolic links to the manpage for pbunzip2 and pbzcat too, thanks to 
  darix for pointing this out
- changed compression of upstream tarball from xz to bzip2 in order to build on 
  older openSUSE and SLE releases

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec  9 23:26:46 UTC 2010 - cristian.rodriguez@opensuse.org

- add an rpm macro file to overload %__bzip2 definition 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec  9 23:07:53 UTC 2010 - cristian.rodriguez@opensuse.org

- Update to git snapshot, only difference is that Build
  is now using autotools. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr 20 00:00:47 UTC 2010 - pascal.bleser@opensuse.org

- update to 1.1.1:
  * improves the decompression performance of long bzip2 streams of large 
    single-stream bzip2 blocks
  * pbzip2 should now decompress files created with bzip2 at least as quickly 
    as bzip2, or slightly faster
  * handles decompression of long bzip2 streams incrementally instead of 
    loading whole streams in memory at once

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 15 17:25:44 UTC 2010 - pascal.bleser@opensuse.org

- update to 1.1.0:
  * adds support for multi-threaded decompression using STDIN/pipes and 
    throttling compression to prevent memory exhaustion with slow output pipe
  * fixes a bug that did not allow command line parameters to be used when 
    compressing data from STDIN
  * contains major improvements to protection of shared variables, error and 
    signal handling, and program termination
  * many more minor enhancements and bugfixes

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan 13 00:00:00 UTC 2009 - guru@unixtech.be

- update to 1.0.5:
  * this release properly complains about trying to read or write compressed
    data to the terminal, and exits
  * fixes the CPU detection crash


-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec 22 00:00:00 UTC 2008 - guru@unixtech.be

- update to 1.0.4:
  * support was added for using pbzip2 with tar and for all remaining bzip2
    command line options, so pbzip2 can be used as a drop-in replacement for
    bzip2
  * a bug was fixed that would cause pbzip2 to crash if detection of the
    number of processors failed


-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Nov  1 00:00:00 UTC 2008 - guru@unixtech.be

- update to 1.0.3:
  * the ability to compress, decompress, and test data using stdin and pipes
    is now supported
  * support was added to directly decompress files without using threads when
    files are small, the system only has 1 CPU, or if the .bz2 file contains 1
    bzip2 stream
  * can now compress 0 byte files like bzip2
  * support for pbzcat symlink to automatically specify a decompression mode
    to stdout, just like bzcat, is now included


-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul 26 00:00:00 UTC 2007 - guru@unixtech.be
