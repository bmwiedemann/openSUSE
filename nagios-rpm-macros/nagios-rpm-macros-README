Hi Packager!

This package contains some RPM macros for building packages that 
make use of some nagios directories or files that ship with 
the nagios package.

Please have a look at the file in /etc/rpm/macros.nagios to 
get an overview and description of the macros.

Just use the following line in your package to make use of the 
macros:

BuildRequires:     nagios-rpm-macros

No need to add this package also as required package - users 
do not need this package, as all macros are just used during
package build.

...and remember to have a lot of fun!
