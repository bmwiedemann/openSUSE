%description
The tmpwatch utility recursively searches through specified directories
and removes files which have not been accessed in a specified period of
time. tmpwatch is normally used to clean up directories which are used
for temporarily holding files (for example, /tmp).

There are multiple tools called "tmpwatch", this package contains the
Fedora/Red Hat version previously available at
https://fedorahosted.org/tmpwatch and now hosted at
https://pagure.io/tmpwatch
