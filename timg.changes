- Update to version 1.5.3
  * Show high-resolution images and video in VSCode terminal (Need
    to set the Terminal > Integrated: Enable Images configuration
    in VSCode)
  * Fix some smallish memory leaks.
  * Better support for terminals that don't implement the
    TIOCGWINSZ completely and don't emit ws_xpixel and ws_ypixel,
    but happen to implement terminal esccape code \e[16t. This
    means that showing animations and columns in these terminals
    now work (this was the case for the VSCode terminal, but maybe
    others).
