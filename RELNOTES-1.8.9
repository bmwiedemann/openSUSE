                       User-Visible OpenAFS Changes

OpenAFS 1.8.9

  All platforms

    * Support for building with more recent compilers (14970 14982..14987
      14990 14991 15056 15057 15061..15064)

    * Build fixes and improvements around the test suite (14879 14880
      14909..14911 15133)

    * Removed a vestigial autoconf check for GSSAPI support that could
      cause unnecessary configure errors (15137)

    * Documentation improvements (14980 15047)

    * Improved diagnostics and error messages. In particular, warn when
      server processes are started without keys and properly print the
      volume transaction flags in "vos status" output (14594 14968)

  All server platforms

    * Avoid several second delays in some situations when the file server
      is breaking callbacks on clients with alternate addresses. Avoid
      unnecessary several second delays in some cases during database
      quorum processing (14815)

    * Detect invalid (negative) inputs to FetchData RPCs and reject them
      early.  The previous behavior only detected the error when actually
      attempting to read from storage, which resulted in the volume being
      taken offline since errors were assumed to originate from the
      underlying storage (15224)

  All UNIX/Linux client platforms

    * Do not perform DNS SRV/AFSDB record queries when running "fs
      getcellstatus", "fs checkservers", and "fs setcell". The DNS
      lookups incur network delays and were not needed to process these
      commands. (14814)

    * Avoid possible string buffer overflows with long cell names (15151)

  FreeBSD

    * Added support for release 12.3 and further improvements (14878
      14920 14921)

  Linux clients

    * Support mainline kernels up to 6.0 (14942..14944 14989 14945
      14946 15058 15065 15094 15095 15148)

    * Fixed a potential memory leak (15096)

    * Avoid a possible performance penalty during file reads when
      the file was opened for both reading and writing (15129)

    * Fixed a type cast which could make builds fail against older kernels
      (15134)

    * In Red Hat packaging, systemd will no longer load the openafs module
      during boot (15128)

  Most client platforms

    * Handle certain failure conditions rather than panicking the system
      (14927 15052)
