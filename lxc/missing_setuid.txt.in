Due to your /etc/permissions configuration (which might be caused by an
outdated permissions package), the lxc-user-nic helper binary has been
installed with a missing setuid bit. This setuid helper is required in order
for LXC unprivileged containers to operate, and has already been reviewed by
the SUSE security team and added to the Factory permissions setuid
whitelist[1].

No action has been taken to fix this configuration problem (in case this was
intentional, and to avoid breaking openSUSE packaging guidelines), so your
administrator will have to fix this manually.

In order to fix this, add the following line to /etc/permissions.local (this is
necessary to avoid losing the setuid bit during package updates or causing
audit warnings):

    @libexecdir@/lxc/lxc-user-nic  root:kvm  04750

and then add the setuid bit to the helper:

    chmod u+s @libexecdir@/lxc/lxc-user-nic

... or you can re-install liblxc@LXC_ABI_MAJOR@.
