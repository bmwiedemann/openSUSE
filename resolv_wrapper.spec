%description
resolv_wrapper makes it possible to contact your own DNS
implmentation in your test environment. It requires socket_wrapper to be able
to contact it. If it does not work on a special platform, the wrapper is able to
fake DNS queries and return valid responses to your application.

This package does not have a devel package, because this project is for
development/testing.
