- Update to version 1.2.0:
  * Most of the mapping functions are
    now supported: abs, acosh, acos, all, and, angle, any, arg,...
    They are simple proxies to the corresponding Octave functions.
  * The display function now supports 3.8, 4.0, 4.2, and upcoming
    4.4 Octave major release.
  * if some specific output format is requested, it must come
    first, e.g. x.dataframe([1:10]) instead of x([1:10].dataframe.
  * a longstanding bug on default separator was corrected. If more
    than one are used, they must be grouped into a cellstr instead
    of a str.
  * a dataframe may now contain 'pages' corresponding to a third
    dimension. The inner mechanism uses a "copy-on-write" scheme
    and avoid duplicating content repeated over many pages.
