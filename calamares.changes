- Update to version 3.2.36.
  * It is now possible to hide the *next* and *back* buttons during
    the "exec" phase of installation. Thanks Anubhav.
  * The Calamares CI has migrated to GitHub actions. Thanks Jonas.
  * *bootloader* now uses the current file names for the UEFI Secure
    Boot shim instead of obsolete ones.
  * The *mount* module creates swap in its own subvolume, if btrfs
    is used.
  * *partition* includes more information about what it will do, 
    including GPT partition types (in human-readable format, if 
    possible).
  * Some edge-cases with overlay filesystems have been resolved in 
    the *partition* module.
  * During the creation of filesystems and partitions, automounting
    is turned off (if DBus is available, and the host system supports
    KDE Solid automount control). This should reduce the number of 
    failed installations if automount grabs partitions while they 
    are being created. The code is prepared to handle other ways 
    to control automount-behavior as well.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jan 31 18:07:15 UTC 2021 - <opensuse.lietuviu.kalba@gmail.com>

- Update to version 3.2.35.1:
  * The partition module now supports a not-full-disk-encryption setup, 
    where /boot is not encrypted, but the rest of the system is.
  * Fixed issue then the initcpiocfg module would sometimes configure 
    the system to ask for a passphrase, when none is needed.
  * The plasmalnf module has been substantially rewritten, so that 
    it can support a QML version of the module in future. The UI has
    changed a little, and now displays more themes than before.
- Add patch 3.2-networkcfg.patch to prevent writing 
    /etc/resolv.conf as a regular file – let openSUSE to create it as 
    a symlink automatically.
- Set default source directory to "/run/overlay/rootfsbase" as
    it is with Kiwi from 9.21.18 (in older Kiwi was "/run/rootfsbase").
    See https://github.com/OSInside/kiwi/issues/1558

Fri Jan 15 17:29:04 UTC 2021 - Fabian Vogt <fabian@ritter-vogt.de>

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov 20 10:50:18 UTC 2020 - andy great <andythe_great@pm.me>

- Update to version 3.2.34.
  * Modules
    * The *keyboard* module had a regression in which it no-longer 
      painted the keycaps in the keyboard preview. 
    * The *plasmalnf* module did not set all of the look-and-feel 
      values in the target system. (reported by Bluestar Linux)
    * In the *users* module, warnings about the strength of the 
      password are now correctly pluralized when possible.
    * In the *users* module, if ICU is installed, the user's full 
      name is automatically transliterated to US-ASCII 
      (for some locales; this will need tweaking) so that the login
      name is acceptable.
- Rebase 3.2.15-unpackfs.conf_Leap15.patch
- Fix spec file, license file move to LICENSES/GPL-3.0-or-later.txt

   UTC+11, but Calamares still showed it in a zone separate from UTC+11.

   it detects internet status through js.
 - tracking now supports kuserfeedback configuration.
 - welcomeq added the GEOIP configuration option, so locale can be
   initially set according to IP address.
 - Welcome to Azerbaijani translations. These are available
   in two variations, Azerbaijani and Azerbaijani (Azerbaijan).
 - Warnings while building with Qt 5.15 have been much reduced.
 - partitioning has one case of undefined behavior (UB) due
   to a missing integer-initialization.
 - keyboardq QML module now works correctly.
 - QML modules with no surrounding navigation -- this is basically a
   special case for full-screen Calamares -- now have margins suitable
   for full-screen use.
 - PythonQt modules are increasingly on the way out.
 - The netinstall module has had some minor UI tweaks.
 - Partitioning now tries harder to avoid floppy drives.

- Updated to Calamares 3.1.0.
  Upstream changes between Calamares 3.0.1 and 3.1.0:
  - improved package selection user interface;
  - support for disabling swap partition creation in automated 
    partitioning;
  - double-click as a way to edit a partition in the manual 
    partitioning view;
  - improved check for internet connection availability;
  - improved package manager handling, so a package operation which
    fails for a single package won’t block other packages;
  - various minor fixes.
  Upstream changes between Calamares 3.0.0 and 3.0.1:
  - fix for an issue in the users module, which could break login 
    if the chosen password had non-Latin1 characters;
  - proper exception handling in the networkcfg module;
  - improved autologin configuration handling for sddm.
  Upstream changes between Calamares 2.4.6 and 3.0.0:

  - improved build system files so module linkage defaults to 
    private;

    not be written to GlobalStorage;
  - added support for building the partition module with both 
    KPMcore 2.2 and 3.0;

    cause the legacy bootloader to be installed on the wrong disk;
  - fixed an issue in the users module to correctly disable the 
    root password if configured to do so;

    correct flags for an EFI system partition.

  - fixes and reliability improvements for the internet connection
    check in the welcome module;
  - fixed GRUB deployment with 32-bit UEFI firmware (note: this 
    also affects some 64-bit systems which ship a 32-bit UEFI 
    firmware);
  - fixed operating system detection for automatic dual boot setup 
    in GRUB;
  - added Btrfs subvolumes setup for @ and @home in automated 
    install modes (note: manual partitioning still doesn’t support

    and Calamares);

    partitioning to set up a system with an encrypted root 
    partition, but with an unencrypted separate /boot partition.
