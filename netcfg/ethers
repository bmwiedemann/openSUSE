#		to the end of the line. The Ethernet-address is written as
#		x:x:x:x:x:x, where x is a hexadecimal number between 0 and
#		ff which represents one byte of the address, which is in
#		network byte order (bigendian). The IP-number may be a
#		hostname which can be resolved by DNS or a dot separated
#		number.
