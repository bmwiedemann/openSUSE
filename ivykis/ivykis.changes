Sun Oct 30 15:50:15 UTC 2016 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 0.40
* This release fixes a pthread_sigmask() pointer aliasing issue,
  and significantly speeds up polling for events by using
  timerfd_create(3) / EVFILT_TIMER / timer_create(3C) to avoid
  creating and destroying a kernel timer for every fd readiness
  polling system call.

- Update to new upstream release 0.39

Wed Jan 16 09:23:26 UTC 2013 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 0.38
* This release fixes various bugs, speeds up timer handling a lot

  suite.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec 20 06:08:42 UTC 2012 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 0.37
* fixes falling back to eventfd(2) if eventfd2(2) was available at
  build time but is not supported by the running kernel
* adds support for ppoll(2)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec  4 22:35:28 UTC 2012 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 0.36
* Work around a kernel change in FreeBSD 9.0-STABLE where /dev/klog
  has become pollable via kevent(), but returns -EINVAL if you try
  to register an EVFILT_WRITE filter, which confused the
  iv_fd_register_try() logic in iv_fd_kqueue.
* Rework iv_timer to use less memory when only a small number of
  timers is in use, and allow adding radix tree levels as needed
  to remove the previous ~1M timer limit.
- Update to new upstream release 0.35
* Fix an abort on iv_work worker thread timeout introduced by the
  race condition fix optimization that went into 0.32.
* Two iv_event race condition fixes.
