Tue Jan 11 08:29:19 UTC 2022 - Alynx Zhou <alynx.zhou@suse.com>

- Add wayland-shm-Close-file-descriptors-not-needed.patch: For
  platforms that support mremap(), we don't need to hold file
  descriptors all the time, because programs like Xwayland will
  hold a lot of file descriptors and may crash, this patch close
  file descriptors earlier for those platforms (bsc#1194190).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 10 18:09:27 UTC 2022 - Stefan Dirsch <sndirsch@suse.com>

- obsolete/provide libwayland-egl-devel 18.0.2 also on sle15-sp4

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec  9 18:08:16 UTC 2021 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 1.20
  * A few protocol additions: wl_surface.offset allows clients to
    update a surface's buffer offset independently from the
    buffer, wl_output.name and description allow clients to
    identify outputs without depending on xdg-output-unstable-v1.
  * In protocol definitions, events have a new "type" attribute
    and can now be marked as destructors.
  * A number of bug fixes, including a race condition when
    destroying proxies in multi-threaded clients.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov 12 20:08:09 UTC 2021 - Bj√∏rn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Switch to meson buildsystem: Add meson BuildRequires and macros.
- Add generic c_compiler and c++_compiler BuildRequires, needed now
  with the meson buildsystem.
- Use ldconfig_scriptlets macro for post(un) handling for
  Tumbleweed and newer.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan 27 18:19:56 UTC 2021 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 1.19
  * This release mostly contains bug fixes and minor
    protocol updates.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb 20 15:02:56 UTC 2020 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Replace public key in keyring with
  34FF9526CFEF0E97A340E2E40FDE7BE0E88F5E48
  (Simon Ser <contact at emersion.fr>).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb 12 08:20:40 UTC 2020 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 1.18
  * Add API to tag proxy objects to allow applications and
    toolkits to share the same Wayland connection
  * Track wayland-server timers in user-space to prevent creating
    too many FDs
  * Add wl_global_remove, a new function to mitigate race
    conditions with globals

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar 21 09:14:59 UTC 2019 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to new upstream release 1.17
  * There is now a protocol to express an internal server error
    message, and a new version of the wl_seat protocol with no
    changes other than keymaps must be private.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov 20 12:57:23 UTC 2018 - sndirsch@suse.com

- Downgrades do not work in SLES service packs, because the SP0
  repo remains enabled for SP1. (This is unlike Leap, where a 15.1
  system will have no 15.0 directories.) As such, to force the
  upgrade from Mesa:libwayland-egl1 to wayland:libwayland-egl1,
  the number in wayland is bumped to >18 for those distros.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov 19 17:12:57 UTC 2018 - sndirsch@suse.com

- add Provides/Obsoletes for libwayland-egl-devel for the devel
  files, which were previously built by Mesa, also on 
  sle15-sp1/Leap 15.1 due to wayland update on these products
  (boo#1116042)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Aug 25 17:24:13 UTC 2018 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 1.16
  * The client definition of wl_global is removed.
  * Some long standing oddness has been fixed with destroy signals.
  * The code generator now supports referencing foreign enums.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 13 15:36:12 UTC 2018 - sndirsch@suse.com

- devel package: add Provides/Obsoletes for libwayland-egl-devel
  for the devel files, which were previously built by Mesa; see also
  https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/613048

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 23 14:57:15 UTC 2018 - bjorn.lie@gmail.com

- Update wayland.keyring to contain Derek Foreman
  derekf@osg.samsung.com public key.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr  9 18:05:05 UTC 2018 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 1.15
  * wl_subcompositor.get_subsurface is now documented to be
    double buffered.
  * wayland-scanner can now generate either public or private
    symbols.
  * libwayland-egl is now part of libwayland (and will presumably
    be removed Mesa soon)
  * The WAYLAND_DISPLAY environment variable can now contain
    absolute paths (where previously it was prefixed by
    XDG_RUNTIME_DIR) - anything that reads WAYLAND_DISPLAY
    outside of libwayland will have to deal with that change
    independently.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb 27 14:00:52 UTC 2018 - emil.l.velikov@gmail.com

- wayland support in Mesa 17 requires wayland >= 1.11 [fate#321223]

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 15 11:53:21 UTC 2017 - jengelh@inai.de

- Add 0001-tests-Fix-new-ID-type-handling-in-argument_from_va_l.patch

  (no longer needed)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Nov  5 21:51:01 UTC 2016 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Add
  wayland-wl_array_Set_data_to_invalid_address_after_free.patch:
  Crash fix patch from upstream git.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 21 05:11:07 UTC 2016 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 1.12.0
* The core protocol documentation has received numerous
  refinements to improve its clarity and consistency. Along with
  this, many blank areas of the protocol documentation have been
  fleshed out.
* A new wl_display_add_protocol logger API provides a new
  interactive way to debug requests; along with this are new APIs
  for examining clients and their resources. This is analogous to
  using WAYLAND_DEBUG=1, but more powerful since it allows run
  time review of log data such as through a UI view.
* There have been improvements to how the protocol XML scanner
  handles version identification in protocol headers. This
  enables better detection and fallback handling when compositors
  and clients support differing versions of their protocols.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun  1 07:54:58 UTC 2016 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 1.11.0
* Final version bump.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May 24 22:55:09 UTC 2016 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 1.10.93
* Proxy wrappers were introduced, which help avoid race
  conditions in multi-threaded clients. A new "proxy wrapper" API
  is added for the client to use when sending requests which does
  not proxy events. This helps avoid one thread causing events to
  be dropped before they can be handled by other threads.
* shm: When undergoing a resize operation while external users
  are holding references to it, the resize is deferred to prevent
  leading to a crash; Wayland now counts external and internal
  users differently to permit tracking this.
* Support for cross-interface enum attributes is added.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb 18 21:44:50 UTC 2016 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 1.10.0
* Drag and drop actions are now added to the Wayland API
* Frame events group pointer events together
* A buffer damage request, wl_surface.damage_buffer, allows
  applications a more convenient way to communicate portions of a
  surface needing to be re-rendered.
* Shared memory buffers now do reference counting to allow
  compositors to delay releasing the memory pools.
* New APIs are provided for getting and setting the socket file
  descriptor Wayland servers use to communicate with their clients.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep 22 15:44:02 UTC 2015 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 1.9.0
* This release brings fixes and modest refactoring.
- License was changed from MIT X11 to MIT Expat upstream.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug 26 09:32:30 UTC 2015 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to new upstream release 1.8.1
* This is just a brown paper bag release. In rolling the wayland
  1.8.0 distribution tarball some files were set to read-only. This
  rectifies that. There are no file content changes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun  3 15:38:20 UTC 2015 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 1.8.0
* Wayland 1.8 splits the client and server header files into core
  and generated protocol. The core headers can be included as
  wayland-client-core.h and wayland-server-core.h. The scanner
  also now supports a --include-core-only option, which causes
  generated code to use only these core headers.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar  4 14:33:17 UTC 2015 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 1.7.0

- Update to new upstream release 1.6.1
* Maintenance release for Wayland 1.6, with a handful of fixes
  pulled from the 1.7 tree that improve handling of several error
  situations between server and clients.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep 19 20:35:43 UTC 2014 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 1.6
* Add error enums to wl_surface.
* Add keyboard repeat information to wl_keyboard protocol.
* Error handling additions in libwayland-client: when a protocol
  error happens, the program can query more detailed information
  about the error.
* New wl_display_add_socket_auto() in libwayland-server:
  automatically find a free socket name.
* Add wl_display_roundtrip_queue(): blocking round-trip on a
  custom queue.
* Stop exposing wl_display global. Turns out binding to the
  global would have triggered bugs, and there was no proper use
  for it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep 12 11:00:08 UTC 2014 - jengelh@inai.de
