- Update to 4.6.1
  * Add support for Python 3.6.
  4.6.0:
  * Introduce option flag ``IGNORE_EXCEPTION_MODULE_IN_PYTHON2`` 
    to normalize exception class names in traceback output.
    In Python 3 they are displayed as the full dotted name.
    In Python 2 they are displayed as "just" the class name.
    When running doctests in Python 3, the option flag will 
    not have any effect, however when running the same test in
    Python 2, the segments in the full dotted name leading up to
    the class name are stripped away from the "expected" string.
  * Drop support for Python 2.6 and 3.2.
  * Add support for Python 3.5.
  * Cleaned up useless 2to3 conversion.
  4.5.0:
  * Added meta data for test case methods created with
    ``zope.testing.doctestcase``.
  * Reasonable values for ``__name__``, making sure that 
    ``__name__`` starts with ``test``.
  * For ``doctestfile`` methods, provide ``filename`` and 
    ``filepath`` attributes.
    The meta data us useful, for example, for selecting tests
    with the nose attribute mechanism.
  * Added ``doctestcase.doctestfiles``
  * Define multiple doctest files at once.
  * Automatically assign test class members.  So rather than::
      class MYTests(unittest.TestCase):
          ...
          test_foo = doctestcase.doctestfile('foo.txt')
    You can use::
      @doctestcase.doctestfiles('foo.txt', 'bar.txt', ...)
      class MYTests(unittest.TestCase):
          ...
  4.4.0:
  * Added ``zope.testing.setupstack.mock`` as a convenience 
    function for setting up mocks in tests.  (The Python
    ``mock`` package must be in the path for this to work. The
    excellent ``mock`` package isn't a dependency of
    ``zope.testing``.)
  * Added the base class ``zope.testing.setupstack.TestCase`` to
    make it much easier to use ``zope.testing.setupstack`` in
    ``unittest`` test cases.
  4.3.0:
  * Added support for creating doctests as methods of
    ``unittest.TestCase`` classes so that they can found 
    automatically by test runners, like *nose* that ignore test
    suites.
  4.2.0:
  * **Actually** remove long-deprecated ``zope.testing.doctest`` 
    (announced as removed in 4.0.0) and
    ``zope.testing.doctestunit``.
  * Add support for PyPy and PyPy3.
