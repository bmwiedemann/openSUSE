- Applied spec-cleaner
- Added bug reference
- Use defconfig file as template for configuration instead of patching it

    User-Name attribute from Access-Accept message, if that is included,

    authenticator
  * driver_madwifi: fixed pairwise key removal to allow WPA reauth

- update hostap-utils to 0.2.4 (no changes)
- update hostap-driver to 0.2.4:

  * fixed compilation with PRISM2_NO_STATION_MODES defined
  * fixed MAC address changing to update address for wifi# interface
    (without this, at least Master mode did not work correctly when
    MAC address was changed for wlan#)
  * fixed inner-BSS bridge (ap_bridge_packets=1) not to bridge
    packets to unauthorized ports when IEEE 802.1X/WPA is used
  * merged CryptoAPI versions of WEP/TKIP/CCMP from the wireless-2.6
    BitKeeper tree (not used by default, can be enabled by defining
    HOSTAP_USE_CRYPTO_API)
  * fixed a buffer overflow in TKIP encryption (hostap_crypt_tkip
    module) on big endian hosts

Sat Apr  3 17:39:13 CEST 2004 - jg@suse.de

- fixed sysfs support in hostap driver (bug #37278)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 30 11:09:31 CEST 2004 - jg@suse.de

- skipping build for UM kernels (bug #37448)

- typo fix in makefile

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Feb 29 12:28:30 CET 2004 - jg@suse.de

- update to hostapd-0.1.3, changes:
  * fixed event loop to call signal handlers only after returning from
    the real signal handler
  * reset sta->timeout_next after successful association to make sure
    that the previously registered inactivity timer will not remove the
    STA immediately (e.g., if STA deauthenticates and re-associates
    before the timer is triggered).
- update to hostap-driver-0.1.3, changes:
  * fixed IEEE 802.11 defragmentation when using host-based WEP
    decryption and bridging packets between two associated STAs
    (this caused a kernel crash in dev_queue_xmit())
  * reconfigure fragmentation threshold after Port0 enable to work around
    issues with some STA firmware versions forgetting the configured
    value
  * restore retry limit after card reset
  * update STA RX statistics also in Repeater mode
  * hostap_cs: fixed CS reset when the netdev is down: need to reset
    hardware even in this case to make resume from suspend mode work
    correctly
  * fixed error reporting from Genesis mode download
  * changed README to use 'make' instead of 'make pccard/pci/plx' when
    building the driver
  * replaced CardServices() calls with calls to matching pcmcia_*()
    functions (required for Linux 2.6.2 and newer)
  * fixed module reference counting of hostap_crypt_wep module for
    Linux 2.6.x (i.e., prevent it from be unloaded if it is still used)
- update to hostap-utils-0.1.3, changes:
  * prism2_srec: ignore PDR 0x0413 if it is not used (this allows some
    of the newer STA firmware 1.8.x versions to be downloaded)
  * prism2_srec: fixed combined RAM download of PRI and STA firmwares
    to use correct start address
- added driver race condition fix from hostap CVS
- rewrote driver Makefile

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 26 15:01:49 CET 2004 - jg@suse.de

    non-volatile firmware images (they will corrupt the card flash)
  * reduced verbosity of prism2_srec
  * added support for volatile download of Primary firmware using
    Genesis mode (this is available only for hfa3842; hfa3841, i.e., old
    Prism2 cards, require hardware changes for similar function)
    ('-g' command line option in prism2_srec)
  * added support for merging two srec file (Primary and Secondary(STA)
    firmware) into one non-volatile (flash) download
- hostapd update to version 0.1.0

    hostap_80211_rx.c and removed Prism2 RX descriptor dependency from
    hostap_ap.c
  * fixed number of compilation issues (RH9 kernel, *.mod files to local
    directory, 2.4.x compilation with CONFIG_MODVERSIONS, external
    pcmcia-cs)
  * removed extra tasklet that was used with TX callback handler
  * update basic rate set automaticallyt when changing supported rate set
  * fixed compilation without Linux Wireless Extensions

    saving mode

    versions older than ver 9
  * added module parameter 'dev_template' for setting the device name
    template (default: 'wlan%d'); this is for hostap_{cs,pci,plx}.o
  * changed monitor mode to use pseudo-IBSS mode instead of Host AP mode
    to avoid sending out Beacon and ProbeResp frames
  * fixed enh_sec setting (hide SSID) to reset Port0 so that the changes
    to the beacon are taken into use immediately
  * added support for selection which authentication algorithm to use
    in station mode
  * added support for manual scan and roaming mode (managed/ad-hoc);
  * process beacon frames in kernel driver even when hostapd is used
  * removed TX power controlling (iwconfig txpower)
