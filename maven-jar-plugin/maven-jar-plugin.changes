- Initial packaging of maven-jar-plugin 3.1.0 as a multibuild
  package in order to be able to bootstrap a repository
- Generate and customize maven build.xml file for the bootstrap
  variant
- Added patch:
  * maven-jar-plugin-bootstrap-resources.patch
    + For the bootstrap variant, add the pre-generated resources
      in order to be able to build even without
