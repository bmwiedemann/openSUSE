%description
Lziprecover is a data recovery tool and decompressor for files in the
lzip compressed data format (.lz) able to repair slightly damaged
files, recover badly damaged files from two or more copies, extract
undamaged members from multi-member files, decompress files and test
integrity of files.

Lziprecover is able to recover or decompress files produced by any of
the compressors in the lzip family; lzip, plzip, minilzip/lzlib,
clzip and pdlzip. This recovery capability contributes to make the
lzip format one of the best options for long-term data archiving.

Lziprecover is able to efficiently extract a range of bytes from a
multi-member file, because it only decompresses the members
containing the desired data.

Lziprecover can print correct total file sizes and ratios even for
multi-member files.
