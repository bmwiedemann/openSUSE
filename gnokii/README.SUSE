to avoid need for suid bit, serial ports are opened by resmgr

suppose your user name is "joesix" all you need to do is to issue the  
following two commands: 
# echo "allow modem user=joesix" > /etc/resmgr.conf.d/60-joesix.conf  
# rcresmgr restart

see /usr/share/doc/packages/resmgr/ for more information
