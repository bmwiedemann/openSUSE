- Update to Release 3.0.5
  + Bugs fixed
    * No longer allow installation if Python 3 but < 3.5.
    * Fixed error `undefined symbol: DATAPTR` if R < 3.5.
- Update to Release 3.0.4
  + Bugs fixed
    * Fixed conversion of `pandas` :class:`Series` of dtype `pandas.Int32Dtype`,
      or `pandas.Int64Dtype`.
- Update to Release 3.0.3
  + Bugs fixed
    * Fixed the evaluation of R code using the "R magic" was delaying all
      output to the end of the execution of that code, independently of
      whether the attribute `cache_display_data` was `True` or `False`.
    * Fixed conversion of :class:`pandas.Series` of `dtype` "object" when
      all items are either all of the same type or are :obj:`None`.
- Update to Release 3.0.2
  + Bugs fixed
    * Failing to import `pandas` or `numpy` when loading the "R magic" extension
      for jupyter/ipython was hiding the cause of the error in the `ImportError`
      exception.
    * Fallback when an R `POSIXct` vector does not had an attribute `"tzone"`.
    * Callback for console reset was not set during R initialization.
    * Fixed rternalized function returning rpy2 objects.
    * `--vanilla` is no longer among the default options used to initialize R.
- Update to Release 3.0.1
  + Bugs fixed
    * Script to install R packages for docker image never made it to version
      control.
    * Conversion of R arrays/matrices into numpy object trigged a segfault
      during garbage collection.
- Update to Release 3.0.0
  + New features
    * rpy2 can be installed without a development environment.
    * Unit tests are now relying on the Python module `pytest`.
    * :attr:`rpy2.rinterface.NA_Integer` is now only defined when the embedded R
      is initialized.
  + Changes
    * complete rewrite of :mod:`rpy2.rinterface`.
      :mod:`cffi` is now used to interface with the R compiled shared library.
      This allows ABI calls and removes the need to compile binaries. However, if
      compilation is available (when installing or preparing pre-compiled binaries)
      faster implementations of performance bottlenecks will be available.
    * calling :func:`rpy2.rinterface.endr` multiple times is now only ending R
      the first time it is called (note: an ended R cannot successfully be
      re-initialized).
    * The conversion system in the mod:`rpy2.robjects.conversion` now has only
      two conversions `py2rpy` and rpy2py`. `py2rpy` tries to convert any
      Python object into an object rpy2 can use with R and `rpy2py` tries
      to convert any rpy2 object into a either a non-rpy2 Python object or
      a mod:`rpy2.robjects` level object.
    * The method `get` for R environments is now called `find()` to avoid
      confusion with the method of the same name in Python (:meth:`dict.get`).
    * :class:`rpy2.robjects.vectors.Vector`, :class:`rpy2.robjects.vectors.Matrix`,
      and :class:`rpy2.robjects.vectors.Array` can no longer be used to create
      R arrays of unspecified type. New type-specific classes (for example for
      vectors :class:`rpy2.robjects.vectors.IntVector`,
      :class:`rpy2.robjects.vectors.BoolVector`,
      :class:`rpy2.robjects.vectors.FloatVector`,
      :class:`rpy2.robjects.vectors.ComplexVector`, or
      :class:`rpy2.robjects.vectors.StrVector`) should be used instead.
    * mod:`rpy2.rpy_classic`, an implementation of the `rpy` interface using
      :mod:`rpy2.rinterface` is no longer available.
    * :class:`rpy2.robjects.ParsedCode` and
      :class:`rpy2.robjects.SourceCode` are moved to
      :class:`rpy2.robjects.packages.ParsedCode` and
      :class:`rpy2.robjects.packages.SourceCode`.
  + Bugs fixed
    * Row names in R data frames were lost when converting to pandas data frames.
  + Known issues
    * Mismatch between R's POSIXlt `wday` and Python time struct_time's `tm_wday`.
- Update to Release 2.9.6
  + Bugs fixed
    * Latest release of :mod:`pandas` deprecated :meth:`DataFrame.from_items`.
    * Latest release of :mod:`pandas` requires categories to be a list
      (not an other sequence).
  + Known issues
    * The numpy buffer implemented by R arrays is broken for complex numbers

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec  3 19:19:21 UTC 2018 - Todd R <toddrme2178@gmail.com>

- Update to 2.9.5
  * Missing values in pandas :class:`Category` series were creating
    invalid R factors when converted (issue #493).

- Remove unused dependencies on blas libraries
- Don't exclude post-build-checks

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug  8 17:33:45 UTC 2018 - toddrme2178@gmail.com

- Update to 2.9.4
  * Fallback for failure to import numpy or pandas is now dissociated from
    failure to import :mod:`numpy2ri` or :mod:`pandas2ri` (issue #463).
  * :func:`repr` for R POSIX date/time vectors is now showing a string
    representation of the date/time rather than the timestamp as a float
    (issue #467).
  * The HTML representation of R data frame (the default representation in the
    Jupyter notebook) was displaying an inconsistent number of rows
    (found while workin on issue #466).
  * Handle time zones in timezones in Pandas when converting to R data frames
    (issue #454).
  * When exiting the Python process, the R cleanup is now explicitly request
    to happen before Python's exit. This is preventing possible segfaults
    the process is terminating (issue #471).
  * dplyr method `ungroup()` was missing from
    :class:`rpy2.robjects.lib.dplyr.DataFrame` (issue #473).

- Update to version 2.9.3
  * Delegate finding where is local time zone file to either a user-specified
    module-level variable `default_timezone` or to the third-party
    module :mod:`tzlocal` (issue #448).
- Update to version 2.9.2
  + Changes
    * The pandas converter is converting :class:`pandas.Series` of `dtype` `"O"`
      to :class:`rpy2.robjects.vectors.StrVector` objects, issueing a warning
      about it (See issue #421).
    * The conversion of pandas data frame is now working with columns rather
      than rows (introduce in bug fix for issue #442 below) and this is expected
      to result in more efficient conversions.
  + Bugs fixed
    * Allow floats in figure sizes for R magic (Pull request #63)
    * Fixed pickling unpickling of robjects-level instances,
      regression introduced in fix for issue #432 with release 2.9.1 (issue #443).
    * Fixed broken unit test for columns of `dtype` `"O"` in `pandas` data frames.
    * Fixed incorrect conversion of R factors in data frames to columns of
      integers in pandas data frame (issue #442).
- Update to version 2.9.1
  + Changes
    * Fixing issue #432 (see Section Bugs fixed below) involved removed the method
      `__reduce__` previously provided for all rpy2 objects representing R objects.
  + Bugs fixed
    * An error when installing with an unsupported R version was fixed (issue #420).
    * The docstring for `rinterface.endr()` was improperly stating that the function was not taking
      any argument (issue #423).
    * Target version of dplyr and tidyr are now 0.7.4 and 0.7.2 respectively. 
    * Fixed memory leak when pickling objects (issue #432). Fixing the leak caused a
      slight change in the API (see Section Changes above).
    * Conversion to :mod:`pandas` now handling R ordered factor (issue #398).
      :mod:`jinja2` was not listed as a dependency (issue #437).

Wed Aug 23 23:00:21 UTC 2017 - toddrme2178@gmail.com

- Implement single-spec version
- Update to version 2.9.0
  * See changes at https://bitbucket.org/rpy2/rpy2/src/33ae1887a9cf3b624ea03b389835cd7a91cb815a/NEWS?at=RELEASE_2_9_0&fileviewer=file-view-default

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May  9 17:51:49 UTC 2016 - toddrme2178@gmail.com

- Update to version 2.7.9
  * Python objects exposed to R could lead to segfault when the Python process is
    exiting (issue #331)
- specfile:
  * updated source url to files.pythonhosted.org
- update to version 2.7.8:
  * New class :class:`rpy2.robjects.SourceCode`. The class extends
    Python's :class:`str` and is meant to represent R source code. An
    HTML renderer for the ipython notebook (syntax highlighting using
    :mod:`pygment` is also added).
  * New module :mod:`rpy2.robjects.lib.tidyr` providing a custom
    wrapper for the R library `tidyr`
  * The long-deprecated functions
    :func:`rpy2.rinterface.set_writeconsole` and
    :func:`rpy2.rinterface.get_writeconsole` are no longer
    available. One of :func:`rpy2.rinterface.set_writeconsole_regular`
    / :func:`rpy2.rinterface.set_writeconsole_warnerror` or
    :func:`rpy2.rinterface.get_writeconsole_regular` /
    :func:`rpy2.rinterface.get_writeconsole_warnerror` respectively
    should be used instead.
  * The attribute :attr:`rpy2.robjects.RObject.slots` can now be
    implictly interated on (the method :meth:`__iter__` is now an
    alias for :meth:`keys`).
- specfile:
  * update copyright year
- update to version 2.7.7:
  * Pickling `robjects`-level objects resulted in `rinterface`-level
    objects when unpickled (issue #324).
- changes from version 2.7.6:
  * :mod:`rpy2.robjects.lib.ggplot2` was modified to match the newly
    released ggplot2-2.0.0. This is introducing API-breaking changes,
    which breaks the promise to keep the API stable through bugfix
    releases within series, but without it 2.7.x will not a work with
    new default installation of the R package ggplot2.
- changes from version 2.7.5:
  * Division and floordivision through the delegator `.ro` provided
    with R vectors wrapped by `robjects`. (issue #320)
  * Memory leak when unserializing (unpickling) R objects bundled in
    Python objects (issue #321)
- update to version 2.7.4:
  * Python 3.5 highlighted slightly incorrect C-level flags in rpy2
    objects declarations, and :mod:`rpy2.robjects` could not be
    imported.
  * Fixed unit tests for rmagic when :mod:`numpy` is not installed,
    and for :mod:`numpy` is installed by :mod:`pandas` in missing.
- update to version 2.7.3:
  * method :meth:`DataFrame.collect` in :mod:`rpy2.robjects.lib.dplyr`
    was not functioning.
  * Applied patch by Matthias Klose to fix implict pointer
    conversions.
  * :mod:`pandas2ri.ri2py_dataframe` is now propagating the row names
    in the R data frame into an index in the pandas data frame (issue
    #285)
  * methods `union`, `intersect`, `setdiff`, `ungroup` defined in the
    R package `dplyr` were missing from the `DataFrame` definition in
    :mod:`rpy2.robjects.lib.dplyr`
- update to version 2.7.2:
  * methods `distinct`, `sample_n`, and `sample_frac` defined in the R
    package `rplyr` were missing from the `DataFrame` definition in
    :mod:`rpy2.robjects.lib.dplyr`
  * The fix for the inheritance problem with
    :mod:`rpy2.robjects.lib.dplyr.DataFrame` introduced a regression
    whenever `group_by` is used.
  * The methods to perform joins on dplyr `DataFrame` objects where
    not working properly.
- update to version 2.7.1:
  * The :meth:`__repr__` for :mod:`robjects`-level vectors was broken
    for vectors of length 1 (issue #306)
  * The ipython notebook-based sections of the documentation
    were not building
  * Classes inheriting from :mod:`dplyr.DataFrame` had dplyr methods
    returning objects of their parent class.
- specfile:
  * check for R-version >= 3.2
- update to version 2.7.0:
  * New exception :class:`rpy2.rinterface.RParsingError`. Errors
    occurring when parsing R code through
    :func:`rpy2.rinterface.parse` raise this exception (previously
    :class:`rpy2.rinterface.RRuntimeError`).
  * New class :class:`rpy2.robjects.conversion.Converter` to replace
    the `namedtuple` of the same name
  * New class :class:`rpy2.robjects.converter.ConversionContext`. This
    is a context manager allowing an easy setting of local conversion
    rules.  The constructor has an alias called
    :meth:`rpy2.robjects.constructor.localconverter`.
  * New module :mod:`rpy2.robjects.lib.dplyr` providing a custom
    wrapper for the R library `dplyr`
  * Method :method:`Environment.items()` to iterate through the
    symbols and associated objects in an R environment.
  * Exception :class:`rpy2.rinterface.ParsingIncompleError`, a child
    class of :class:`rpy2.rinterface.ParsingError`, raised when
    calling :meth:`rpy2.rinteface.parse` results in R's C-level status
    to be `PARSE_INCOMPLETE`. This can make the Python implementation
    of an IDE for R easier.
  * Attribute :attr:`slots` for :mod:`rpy2.robjects`-level
    objects. The attribute is a :class:`rpy2.robjects.Rslots` which
    behaves like a Python mapping to provide access to R-attributes
    for the object (see issue #275).
  * The R "magic" for ipython `%%R` can be passed a local converter
    (see new features above) by using `-c`.
  * Conversion  rules were  not  applied when  parsing and  evaluating
    string as R with :class:`rpy2.robjects.R`.
  * Calling the constructor for
    :class:`rpy2.robjects.vectors.FactorVector` with an R factor is no
    longer making a copy, loosing the associated R attributes if any
    (fixes issue #299).
  * `rpy2` could crash when R was unable to dynamically load the C
    extension for one of its packages (noticed with issue #303).
  * :func:`rpy2.rinterface.is_initialized` is now a function.
  * :meth:`rpy2.robjects.R.__call__` is now calling R's
    `base::parse()` to parse the string rather the parser through R's
    C-API. The workaround let's us retrieve R's error message in case
    of failure (see issue #300)
- changes from version 2.6.3:
  * Metaclass `RS4Auto_Type` facilitating the creation of Python
    classes from R S4 classes was not handling classes without methods
    (issue #301)
- update to version 2.6.2:
  * Check that R >= 3.2 is used at build time (issue #291)
  * Conversion rules were not applied when parsing and evaluating
    string as R code with :class:`rpy2.robjects.R`.
- update to version 2.6.1:
  * Because of their long names, the classes
    :class:`SignatureTranslatedAnonymousPackage`,
    :class:`SignatureTranslatedPackage`, and
    :class:`SignatureTranslatedFunction` in
    :mod:`rpy2.robjects.packages` have now the aliases :class:`STAP`,
    :class:`STP`, and :class:`STF` respectively.
  * Typo in function name emitting warnings at build time (issue #283)
  * The conversion of `TaggedList` instances is now handling the names
    of items in the list (issue #286)
  * Loading the `ipython` extension in the absence of `pandas` or
    `numpy` is now issuing a warning (issue #279)
- update to version 2.6.0:
  * Report the existence during build time of a file `.Renviron`, or
    the definition of the environment variables `R_ENVIRON' or
    `R_ENVIRON_USER` with a warning. (issue #204)
  * Moved console writting callback to use `ptr_R_WriteConsoleEx`
    rather than `ptr_R_WriteConsole`. This allows callbacks for
    warnings and messages. `get/set_writeconsole` is now replaced by
    `get/set_writeconsole_regular` (regular output) and
    `get/set_writeconsole_warnerror` (warning and error).  In order to
    conserve backward compatibility an alias for
    `get/set_writeconsole_regular` called `get/set_writeconsole` is
    provided.
  * Added callback for `ptr_R_ResetConsole`.
  * `pandas` :class:`Categorical` objects are automatically handled in
    the pandas converter.
  * The translation of R symbols into Python symbols used in `importr`
    and underlying classes and methods can be customized with a
    callback.  The default translation turning `.` into `_` is
    `default_symbol_r2python`.
  * Translation of named arguments in R function is now sharing code
    with the translation of R symbols (see point above), providing a
    consistent way to perform translations.
  * Utility function `sequence_to_vector` in `robjects` to convert
    Python sequences (e.g., `list` or `tuple`) to R vector without
    having to specify the type (the type is inferred from the list).
  * `robjects.vectors` object have a property :attr:`NAvalue`
    that contains the `NA` value for the vector, allowing generic code
    on R vectors.  For example, testing whether any vector contains
    `NA` can be written as `any(x is myvector.NAvalue for x in
    myvector)`. Making numpy /masked/ array is an other application.
  * Changes
    + The automatic name translation from R to Python used in
      `importr` is now slightly more complex. It will not only
      translate `.` to `_` but should a conflict arise from the
      existence in R of both the `.` and `_` versions the `.` version
      will be appended a `_` (in accordance with :pep:0008). The
      change was discussed in issue #274).
    + The ipython 'R magic' is now starting with a default conversion
      mode that is `pandas2ri` if it can find it, then `numpy2ri` if
      it can find it, and then the basic conversion.
    + R vectors are now typed at the C level (IntSexpVector,
      FloatSexpVector, ListSexpVector, etc...) whenever retrieving
      them from the embedded R with the low-level `rinterface`. This
      is facilitating dispatch on vector type (e.g., with
      `singledispatch` now used for the conversion system).
  * Bugs fixed
    + The evaluation of R code through R's C-level function `tryEval`
      caused console output whenever an error occurred. Moving to the
      seemingly experimental `tryEvalSilent` makes evaluations less
      verbose.
    + Multiple plots in one ipython cell (pull request #44)
- changes from version 2.5.7:
  * "simplegeneric" was moved of ipython 4.0.0 (pull request #43)

- specfile:
  * update copyright year
  * README -> README.md

  * Possible segfault with Python 3.4 (issue #249)
- changes to version 2.5.3:
  * 'setup.py' has 'install_requires' in addition to 'requires' in the
    hope to fix the missing dependency with Python 2
    ('singledispatch' is required but not installed).
  * Extracting configuration information from should now work when R
    is emitting a warning (issue #247)
  * On OS X the library discovery step can yield nothing (see issue
    #246). A tentative fix is to issue a warning and keep moving.
- changes to version 2.5.2:
  * String representation of 'robjects.R' (issue #238)
  * Check during 'build_ext' if unsupported version of R (pull request
    #32)
  * HTMl display of columns of factors in a DataFrame (issue #236)
  * HTML display of factors (issue #242)
- changes to version 2.5.1:

  * Fixed bug when R spits out a warning when asked configuration
    information (issue #233)
  * Restored printing of compilation information when running

  * Fixed installation issue on some systems (issue #234)
  * Workaround obscure failure message from unittest if Python < 3.4
    and 'singledispatch' cannot be imported (issue #235)
- changes to version 2.5.0:
  * Experimental alternative way to preserve R objects from garbage
    collection.  This can be activated with
    'rinterface.initr(r_preservehash=True)' (default is 'False'.
  * 'GGPlot' object getting a method 'save' mirroring R's
    'ggplot2::ggsave()'.

  * [Experimental] New function 'robjects.methods.rs4instance_factory'
    to type RS4 objects with more specificity.
  * The script 'setup.py' was rewritten for clarity and ease of
    maintenance.  Now it only uses 'setuptools'.
- changes to version 2.4.4:
  * Use 'input' rather than 'raw_input' in the default console
    callback with Python 3 (fixes issue #222)
  * Issues with conversions, pandas, and rmagic (fixes issue #218 and

- Release 2.4.2
  * Bugs fixed
    - Assigning an R `DataFrame` into an environment was failing if
      the conversion for Pandas was activated. (Issue #207)
- Release 2.4.1
  * Bugs fixed
    - :meth:`rpy2.ipython` fixed spurious output to notebook cells.
- Release 2.4.0
  * Changes
    - Conversion system slightly changed, with the optional
      conversions for :mod:`numpy` and :mod:`pandas` modified
      accordingly. The changes should only matter if using
      third-party conversion functions.
    - The Python 3 version is now a first class citizen. `2to3`
      is no longer used, and the code base is made directly
      compatible with Python. This lowers significantly the
      installation time with Python 3 
      (which matters when developping rpy2).
    - The default options to initialize R (`rpy2.rinterface.initoptions') are no longer
      `('rpy2', '--quiet', '--vanilla', '--no-save')` but now
      `('rpy2', '--quiet', '--no-save')`.
    - :class:`robjects.vectors.ListVector` can be instanciated from
      any objects with a method `items()` with the expectation that the method
      returns an iterable of (name, value) tuples, or even be an iterable
      of (name, value) tuples.
  * New features
    - For instances of :class:`rpy2.robjects.Function`,
      the `__doc__` is now a property fetching information
      about the parameters in the R signature.
    - Convenience function :func:`rpy2.robjects.packages.data`
      to extract the datasets in an R pacakges
    - :mod:`ipython`'s `rmagic` is now part of :mod:`rpy`. To use, `%load_ext
      rpy2.ipython` from within IPython.
    - new method :meth:`rpy2.rinterface.SexpEnvironment.keys`, returnings
      the names in the environment as a tuple of Python strings.
