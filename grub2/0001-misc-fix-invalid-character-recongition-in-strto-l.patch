Subject: [PATCH 1/8] misc: fix invalid character recongition in strto*l

From: Aaron Miller <aaronmiller@fb.com>

Would previously allow digits larger than the base and didn't check that
subtracting the difference from 0-9 to lowercase letters for characters
larger than 9 didn't result in a value lower than 9, which allowed the
parses: ` = 9, _ = 8, ^ = 7, ] = 6, \ = 5, and [ = 4
