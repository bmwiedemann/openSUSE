-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May 26 14:54:40 UTC 2020 - John Paul Adrian Glaubitz <adrian.glaubitz@suse.com>

- Update to 1.0.5
  * Changed number of columns in type code output ("sgdisk -L"
    and equivalents in gdisk and cgdisk) from 3 to 2, since some
    descriptions are long enough that they are ambiguous with
    three columns.
  * You can now put the 0xEE partition last in a hybrid MBR using
    sgdisk. (Previously, this was possible with gdisk but not
    with sgdisk.) See the sgdisk man page for details.
  * Added numerous type codes for Container Linux, Veracrypt, and
    Freedesktop.org's Discoverable Partitions Specification
  * Partition type name searches are now case-insensitive.
  * It is now possible to quit out of partition type name
    searches by typing "q".
  * When changing a partition type code, the default is now the
    current type code, not a platform-specific type code.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct 24 04:20:34 UTC 2018 - sean@suspend.net

- Update to 1.0.4
  * 74 new type codes added
  * Search/filter function to the type code list
  * GPT fdisk now reports more details about data structures
  * Misc bug fixes

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 26 16:51:10 CEST 2018 - kukuk@suse.de

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 26 14:25:43 UTC 2015 - sweet_f_a@gmx.de

- Update to new upstream release 1.0.1
  * new type codes
  * bug fixes
  * changes to the OS X build for OS X 10.11 ("El Capitan")

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 27 10:22:39 UTC 2015 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 1.0.0
  * Added partition type for Windows Storage Spaces, Ceph,
    and Discoverable Linux Partitions.
  * Added -O/--print-mbr option to sgdisk

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Mar  8 09:33:02 UTC 2015 - jengelh@inai.de

- Remove old RPM tags for pre-12.x openSUSE.
  Remove duplicated documentation.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar  4 10:19:25 UTC 2014 - sweet_f_a@gmx.de

- Update to new upstream release 0.8.10
 * Bug fix of previous version: The hybrid MBR creation code in
   gdisk would ignore the second and third partitions to be
   hybridized.
 * Fix bug that could cause incorrect partition end points to be
   set on hybridized partitions that spanned the 2^32-sector mark
   on disks.
 * Finally, this version enables the use of 0 as a value for a
   partition number to the -A/--attributes, -c/--change-name,
   -t/--typecode, and -u/--partition-guid commands if an earlier
   -n/--new option created a new partition; in this case, 0 refers
   to that newly-created partition.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb 25 14:40:22 UTC 2014 - sweet_f_a@gmx.de

- Update to new upstream release 0.8.9
 * Three new type codes.
 * The verify (v) function now checks for MBR partitions (the 0xEE
   protective partitions or hybrid MBR partitions) that don't fit
   on the disk.
 * The GPT-destruction options (z in gdisk, -z and -Z in sgdisk)
   now wipe out the final few sectors on the disk rather than
   wherever the backup GPT data are recorded as being. This is done
   to prevent wiping out data mid-disk, which can otherwise happen
   if a RAID array is resized in certain ways and the GPT data are
   not moved prior to wiping the GPT data.
 * The FixParts program had developed a bug in which it complained
   that the 0xEE partition didn't begin on sector 1; this version
   fixes that bug.
 * Finally, this version removes the dependency on libicu for UTF-16
   support in partition names.
- remove obsolete libicu dependency

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov 13 13:18:19 UTC 2013 - sweet_f_a@gmx.de

- Update to new upstream release 0.8.8
  * Fixed bug that could cause segfault when passing an invalid
    partition number to sgdisk's -i/--info command.
  * Added new partition type codes.
  * Added a pause (with a prompt to hit <Enter>) to display more
    items gdisk and cgdisk. There's no such pause/prompt in sgdisk,
    though.
  * Fine-tuned verification ('v') check for 0xEE partition that
    doesn't begin on sector 1.
  * Fixed hybrid MBR creation on disks larger than 2TiB
  * Added check for an active/bootable 0xEE protective partition to
    the verify ('v') function.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul 29 22:18:09 UTC 2013 - sweet_f_a@gmx.de

- Update to new upstream release 0.8.7
  * Small improvements and bug fixes mark this revision.
  * Three new partition type codes have been added:
    freedesktop.org's proposed $BOOT partition (type code EA00),
    the Intel Rapid Start partition (code 8400),
    and for Haiku's BFS (code EB00).
  * Removed a stray debug message that appeared when reading MBR
    disks.
  * The "converting MBR to GPT" message has been modified to
    clarify that changes are being held in memory.
  * The Mac version now works on /dev/rdisk* devices as well as
    /dev/disk* devices.
  * When used with /dev/rdisk* devices, the partition table can
    sometimes be re-read without rebooting or unplugging and
    re-inserting the disk.
  * Finally, cgdisk now supports a -a option, which works similarly
    to the -a option in cfdisk.
- remove gptfdisk-0.8.5-fix-test-suite-short-opt-usage.patch, is
