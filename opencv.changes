  * DNN module:
    + Intel Inference Engine backend (OpenVINO):
      - 2019R3 has been supported
      - Support modern IE Core API
      - New approach for custom layers management. Now all the OpenCV
        layers fallbacks are implemented as IE custom layers which
        helps to improve efficiency due less graph partitioning.
      - High-level API which introduces dnn::Model class and set of
        task-specific classes such dnn::ClassificationModel,
        dnn::DetectionModel, dnn::SegmentationModel. It supports
        automatic pre- and post-processing for deep learning networks.

Tue Jul  2 23:06:30 UTC 2019 - Stefan Brüns <stefan.bruens@rwth-aachen.de>

- Update to version 4.1.0
  * DNN module:
    + Reduced peak memory consumption for some models up to 30%.
    + Inference Engine
      - Inference Engine 2018R3 is now a minimal supported version of IE.
      - Myriad X (Intel® Neural Compute Stick 2) is now supported and tested.
      - Automatic IR network reshaping for different inputs.
      - Improved samples to work with models from OpenVINO Open Model Zoo
    + New networks from TensorFlow Object Detection API: Faster-RCNNs, SSDs
      and Mask-RCNN with dilated convolutions, FPN SSD
  * Performance improvements:
    + More optimization using AVX2 instruction set.
    + Automatic runtime dispatching is available for large set of functions
      from core and imgproc modules.
  * Other improvements:
    + Matplotlib Perceptually Uniform Sequential colormaps
    + Add keypoints matching visualization for real-time pose estimation tutorial
    + Add Hand-Eye calibration methods
    + Java: improved support for multidimensional arrays (Mat)
    + Dynamically loaded videoio backends (FFmpeg, GStreamer)

    + opencv_contrib: Implementation of Quasi Dense Stereo algorithm
    + opencv_contrib: New module: Image Quality Analysis (IQA) API
    + opencv_contrib: BRISQUE No Reference Image Quality Assessment (IQA) API
  Check https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/ChangeLog#version410
- Update to version 4.0.0
  * A lot of C API from OpenCV 1.x has been removed. The affected modules are
    objdetect, photo, video, videoio, imgcodecs, calib3d.
  * Persistence (storing and loading structured data to/from XML, YAML or JSON)
    in the core module has been completely reimplemented.
  * OpenCV is now C++11 library and requires C++11-compliant compiler.
    Thanks to the extended C++11 standard library, we could get rid of hand-crafted
    cv::String and cv::Ptr. Now cv::String == std::string and cv::Ptr is a thin
    wrapper on top of std::shared_ptr. Also, on Linux/BSD for cv::parallel_for_
    we now use std::thread's instead of pthreads.
  * DNN improvements
  * Completely new module opencv_gapi has been added. It is the engine for very
    efficient image processing, based on lazy evaluation and on-fly construction.
  * Performance improvements
    A few hundreds of basic kernels in OpenCV have been rewritten using so-called
    "wide universal intrinsics". Those intrinsics map to SSE2, SSE4, AVX2, NEON or
    VSX intrinsics, depending on the target platform and the compile flags.
  * QR code detector and decoder have been added to opencv/objdetect module.
  * The popular Kinect Fusion algorithm has been implemented, optimized for CPU and
    GPU (OpenCL), and integrated into opencv_contrib/rgbd module.
  * Very efficient and yet high-quality DIS dense optical flow algorithm has been
    moved from opencv_contrib to opencv, video module. See the example.
  * The slower TV L1 optical flow algorithm has been moved to opencv_contrib.

  - IPPICV is now based on IPP 9.0.1, which should make OpenCV
    even faster on modern Intel chips
  - opencv_contrib modules can now be included into the
    opencv2.framework for iOS
  - Newest operating systems are supported: Windows 10 and
    OSX 10.11 (Visual Studio 2015 and XCode 7.1.1)
  - Interoperability between T-API and OpenCL, OpenGL, DirectX and
    Video Acceleration API on Linux, as well as Android 5 camera.
  - HAL (Hardware Acceleration Layer) module functionality has been
    moved into corresponding basic modules; the HAL replacement
    mechanism has been implemented along with the examples
- Removed improve-sphinx-search.diff, opencv-altivec-vector.patch,
  opencv-pkgconfig.patch and opencv-samples.patch, fixed upstream.
- Fixed opencv-qt5-sobump.diff, opencv-build-compare.patch,
  opencv-gcc5.patch and opencv-gles.patch.

- Version OpenCV 3.0.0
  + ~1500 patches, submitted as PR @ github. All our patches go
    the same route.
  + opencv_contrib (http://github.com/itseez/opencv_contrib)
    repository has been added. A lot of new functionality is there
    already! opencv_contrib is only compatible with 3.0/master,
    not 2.4. Clone the repository and use “cmake …
    -D OPENCV_EXTRA_MODULES_PATH=<path_to opencv_contrib/modules> …”
    to build opencv and opencv_contrib together.
  + a subset of Intel IPP (IPPCV) is given to us and our users free
    of charge, free of licensing fees, for commercial and
    non-commerical use. It’s used by default in x86 and x64 builds
    on Windows, Linux and Mac.
  + T-API (transparent API) has been introduced, this is transparent
    GPU acceleration layer using OpenCL. It does not add any
    compile-time or runtime dependency of OpenCL. When OpenCL is
    available, it’s detected and used, but it can be disabled at
    compile time or at runtime. It covers ~100 OpenCV functions.
    This work has been done by contract and with generous support
    from AMD and Intel companies.
  + ~40 OpenCV functions have been accelerated using NEON intrinsics
    and because these are mostly basic functions, some higher-level
    functions got accelerated as well.
  + There is also new OpenCV HAL layer that will simplifies creation
    of NEON-optimized code and that should form a base for the
    open-source and proprietary OpenCV accelerators.
  + The documentation is now in Doxygen: http://docs.opencv.org/master/
  + We cleaned up API of many high-level algorithms from features2d,
    calib3d, objdetect etc. They now follow the uniform
    “abstract interface – hidden implementation” pattern and make
    extensive use of smart pointers (Ptr<>).
  + Greatly improved and extended Python & Java bindings (also,
    see below on the Python bindings), newly introduced Matlab
    bindings (still in alpha stage).
  + Improved Android support – now OpenCV Manager is in Java and
    supports both 2.4 and 3.0.
  + Greatly improved WinRT support, including video capturing and
    multi-threading capabilities. Thanks for Microsoft team for this!
  + Big thanks to Google who funded several successive GSoC programs
    and let OpenCV in. The results of many successful GSoC 2013 and
    2014 projects have been integrated in opencv 3.0 and
    opencv_contrib (earlier results are also available in
    OpenCV 2.4.x). We can name:
    - text detection
    - many computational photography algorithms (HDR, inpainting,
      edge-aware filters, superpixels, …)
    - tracking and optical flow algorithms
    - new features, including line descriptors, KAZE/AKAZE
    - general use optimization (hill climbing, linear programming)
    - greatly improved Python support, including Python 3.0 support,
      many new tutorials & samples on how to use OpenCV with Python.
    - 2d shape matching module and 3d surface matching module
    - RGB-D module
    - VTK-based 3D visualization module
    - etc.
  + Besides Google, we enjoyed (and hope that you will enjoy too)
    many useful contributions from community, like:
    - biologically inspired vision module
    - DAISY features, LATCH descriptor, improved BRIEF
    - image registration module
    - etc.

- Update to OpenCV 2.4.3
  More info at:
  http://opencv.org/opencv-2-4-3-released.html
  The nicely formatted changelog can be seen here:
  http://code.opencv.org/projects/opencv/wiki/ChangeLog;
  here are the highlights:
  * A lot of good stuff from the Google Summer of Code 2012 has been
    integrated; this was a very productive summer!
  * Significantly improved and optimized Android and iOS ports.
  * Greatly extended GPU (i.e. CUDA-based) module.
  * The brand new ocl (OpenCL-based) module that unleashes GPU power
    also for AMD and Intel GPU users. It’s not included into the
    binary package, since there are different SDKs, and it’s not
    turned on by default. You need to run CMake and turn on
    “WITH_OPENCL”. Also, please note that this is very first version
    of the module, so it may be not very stable and not very
    functional.
  * Much better performance on many-core systems out of the box. You
    do not need TBB anymore on MacOSX, iOS and Windows. BTW, the
    binary package for Windows is now built without TBB support.
    Libraries and DLLs for Visual Studio 2010 use the Concurrency
    framework.
  * About 130 bugs have been fixed since 2.4.2.
  * Since 2.4.3rc we fixed several more problems, in particular some
    compile problems with iOS 6 SDK.
