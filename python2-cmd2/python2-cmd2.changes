- remove singlespec madness for python 2.x only package: 10
  lines shorter spec file and even builds for distros older
  than Tumbleweed.

Thu Sep 20 20:08:59 UTC 2018 - Todd R <toddrme2178@gmail.com>

- Split out python2-only version of package since the latest
  version is python3-only.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep  5 20:07:43 UTC 2018 - dmueller@suse.com

- update to 0.8.9:
  * Bug Fixes
    * Fixed extra slash that could print when tab completing users on Windows
    * Prevent crashes that could occur attempting to open a file in non-existent directory or with very long filename
    * Make sure pip installs version 0.8.x if you have python 2.7
    * Commands using the @with_argparser_and_unknown_args were not correctly recognized when tab completing
    * Fixed issue where completion display function was overwritten when a submenu quits
    * Fixed ``AttributeError`` on Windows when running a ``select`` command cause by **pyreadline** not implementing ``remove_history_item``
  * Bug Fixes
    * Fixed a bug with all argument decorators where the wrapped function wasn't returning a value and thus couldn't cause the cmd2 app to quit

  * Enhancements
    * Added warning about **libedit** variant of **readline** not being supported on macOS
    * Added tab-completion of alias names in value filed of **alias** command
    * Enhanced the ``py`` console in the following ways
        * Added tab completion of Python identifiers instead of **cmd2** commands
        * Separated the ``py`` console history from the **cmd2** history
    * Added support for verbose help with -v where it lists a brief summary of what each command does
    * Added support for categorizing commands into groups within the help menu
        * See the [Grouping Commands](http://cmd2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/argument_processing.html?highlight=verbose#grouping-commands) section of the docs for more info
        * See [help_categories.py](https://github.com/python-cmd2/cmd2/blob/master/examples/help_categories.py) for an example
    * Tab completion of paths now supports ~user user path expansion
    * Simplified implementation of various tab completion functions so they no longer require ``ctypes``
    * Expanded documentation of ``display_matches`` list to clarify its purpose. See cmd2.py for this documentation.
    * Adding opening quote to tab completion if any of the completion suggestions have a space.
    * Tab completion has been overhauled and now supports completion of strings with quotes and spaces.
    * Tab completion will automatically add an opening quote if a string with a space is completed.
    * Added ``delimiter_complete`` function for tab completing delimited strings
    * Added more control over tab completion behavior including the following flags. The use of these flags is documented in cmd2.py
        * ``allow_appended_space``
        * ``allow_closing_quote``
    * Due to the tab completion changes, non-Windows platforms now depend on [wcwidth](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/wcwidth).
    * An alias name can now match a command name.
    * An alias can now resolve to another alias.

  * **Python 2 EOL notice**
    * This is the last release where new features will be added to ``cmd2`` for Python 2.7
    * The 0.9.0 release of ``cmd2`` will support Python 3.4+ only
    * Additional 0.8.x releases may be created to supply bug fixes for Python 2.7 up until August 31, 2018
    * After August 31, 2018 not even bug fixes will be provided for Python 2.7

    * Fixed conditional dependency issue in setup.py that was in 0.8.3.
    * Fixed ``help`` command not calling functions for help topics
    * Fixed not being able to use quoted paths when redirecting with ``<`` and ``>``

  * Enhancements
  * Attribute Changes (Breaks backward compatibility)
    * ``exclude_from_help`` is now called ``hidden_commands`` since these commands are hidden from things other than help, including tab completion
        * This list also no longer takes the function names of commands (``do_history``), but instead uses the command names themselves (``history``)
    * ``excludeFromHistory`` is now called ``exclude_from_history``
    * ``cmd_with_subs_completer()`` no longer takes an argument called ``base``. Adding tab completion to subcommands has been simplified to declaring it in the
    subcommand parser's default settings. This easily allows arbitrary completers like path_complete to be used.
    See [subcommands.py](https://github.com/python-cmd2/cmd2/blob/master/examples/subcommands.py) for an example of how to use
    tab completion in subcommands. In addition, the docstring for ``cmd_with_subs_completer()`` offers more details.
* Bug Fixes
    * Fixed a bug in tab-completion of command names within sub-menus
    * Fixed a bug when using persistent readline history in Python 2.7
    * Fixed a bug where the ``AddSubmenu`` decorator didn't work with a default value for ``shared_attributes``
    * Added a check to ``ppaged()`` to only use a pager when running in a real fully functional terminal

    * Added possibility of having readline history preservation in a SubMenu
    * Added [table_display.py](https://github.com/python-cmd2/cmd2/blob/master/examples/table_display.py) example to demonstrate how to display tabular data
    * Added command aliasing with ``alias`` and ``unalias`` commands
    * Added the ability to load an initialization script at startup
        * See [alias_startup.py](https://github.com/python-cmd2/cmd2/blob/master/examples/alias_startup.py) for an example
    * Added a default SIGINT handler which terminates any open pipe subprocesses and re-raises a KeyboardInterrupt
    * For macOS, will load the ``gnureadline`` module if available and ``readline`` if not
* Bug Fixes
    * Fixed a bug if a non-existent **do_*** method was added to the ``exclude_from_help`` list
    * Fixed a bug in a unit test which would fail if your home directory was empty on a Linux system

    * Fixed outdated [remove_unused.py](https://github.com/python-cmd2/cmd2/blob/master/examples/remove_unused.py)
* Enhancements
    * Added support for sub-menus.
        * See [submenus.py](https://github.com/python-cmd2/cmd2/blob/master/examples/submenus.py) for an example of how to use it

        * See [persistent_history.py](https://github.com/python-cmd2/cmd2/blob/master/examples/persistent_history.py) for an example
        * See the [Searchable command history](http://cmd2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/freefeatures.html#searchable-command-history) section of the documentation for more info
    * Improved PyPI packaging by including unit tests and examples in the tarball
    * Improved documentation to make it more obvious that **poutput()** should be used instead of **print()**
    * ``exclude_from_help`` and ``excludeFromHistory`` are now instance instead of class attributes
    * Added flag and index based tab completion helper functions
        * See [tab_completion.py](https://github.com/python-cmd2/cmd2/blob/master/examples/tab_completion.py)
    * Added support for displaying output which won't fit on the screen via a pager using ``ppaged()``
        * See [paged_output.py](https://github.com/python-cmd2/cmd2/blob/master/examples/paged_output.py)
* Attributes Removed (**can cause breaking changes**)
    * ``abbrev`` - Removed support for abbreviated commands
        * Good tab completion makes this unnecessary and its presence could cause harmful unintended actions
    * ``case_insensitive`` - Removed support for case-insensitive command parsing
        * Its presence wasn't very helpful and could cause harmful unintended actions
* Bug Fixes
    * Fixed unit tests on Python 3.7 due to changes in how re.escape() behaves in Python 3.7
    * Fixed a bug where unknown commands were getting saved in the history
* Enhancements
    * Three new decorators for **do_*** commands to make argument parsing easier
        * **with_argument_list** decorator to change argument type from str to List[str]
            * **do_*** commands get a single argument which is a list of strings, as pre-parsed by shlex.split()
        * **with_arparser** decorator for strict argparse-based argument parsing of command arguments
            * **do_*** commands get a single argument which is the output of argparse.parse_args()
        * **with_argparser_and_unknown_args** decorator for argparse-based argument parsing, but allows unknown args
            * **do_*** commands get two arguments, the output of argparse.parse_known_args()
    *  See the [Argument Processing](http://cmd2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/argument_processing.html) section of the documentation for more information on these decorators
        * Alternatively, see the [argparse_example.py](https://github.com/python-cmd2/cmd2/blob/master/examples/argparse_example.py)
        and [arg_print.py](https://github.com/python-cmd2/cmd2/blob/master/examples/arg_print.py) examples
    * Added support for Argparse sub-commands when using the **with_argument_parser** or **with_argparser_and_unknown_args** decorators
        * See [subcommands.py](https://github.com/python-cmd2/cmd2/blob/master/examples/subcommands.py) for an example of how to use subcommands
        * Tab-completion of sub-command names is automatically supported
    * The **__relative_load** command is now hidden from the help menu by default
        * This command is not intended to be called from the command line, only from within scripts
    * The **set** command now has an additional **-a/--all** option to also display read-only settings
    * The **history** command can now run, edit, and save prior commands, in addition to displaying prior commands.
    * The **history** command can now automatically generate a transcript file for regression testing
        * This makes creating regression tests for your ``cmd2`` application trivial
* Commands Removed
    * The **cmdenvironment** has been removed and its functionality incorporated into the **-a/--all** argument to **set**
    * The **show** command has been removed.  Its functionality has always existing within **set** and continues to do so
    * The **save** command has been removed. The capability to save commands is now part of the **history** command.
    * The **run** command has been removed. The capability to run prior commands is now part of the **history** command.
* Other changes
    * The **edit** command no longer allows you to edit prior commands. The capability to edit prior commands is now part of the **history** command. The **edit** command still allows you to edit arbitrary files.
    * the **autorun_on_edit** setting has been removed.
    * For Python 3.4 and earlier, ``cmd2`` now has an additional dependency on the ``contextlib2`` module
* Deprecations
    * The old **options** decorator for optparse-based argument parsing is now *deprecated*
        * The old decorator is still present for now, but will be removed in a future release
        * ``cmd2`` no longer includes **optparse.make_option**, so if your app needs it import directly from optparse
