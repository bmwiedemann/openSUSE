%description
YAML::PP is a modular YAML processor.

It aims to support 'YAML 1.2' and 'YAML 1.1'. See https://yaml.org/. Some
(rare) syntax elements are not yet supported and documented below.

YAML is a serialization language. The YAML input is called "YAML Stream". A
stream consists of one or more "Documents", separated by a line with a
document start marker '---'. A document optionally ends with the document
end marker '...'.

This allows one to process continuous streams additionally to a fixed input
file or string.

The YAML::PP frontend will currently load all documents, and return only
the first if called with scalar context.

The YAML backend is implemented in a modular way that allows one to add
custom handling of YAML tags, perl objects and data types. The inner API is
not yet stable. Suggestions welcome.

You can check out all current parse and load results from the
yaml-test-suite here: https://perlpunk.github.io/YAML-PP-p5/test-suite.html
