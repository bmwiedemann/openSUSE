- Update to version 2.4.0

Important
  * version 2.4.0 carries quite a number of relatively small changes (see: 
    Bugfixes and Features below) that are subtle but may impact runtime 
    behavior nevertheless; you should verify an upgrade in a test environment 
    before rolling out to production
  * this release deprecates the OAuth 2.0 Resource Server functionality 
    which is now implemented as a separate module mod_oauth2.

Bugfixes
  * URL-encode client_id/client_secret when using client_secret_basic according to:
    https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-2.3.1
  * fix parsing and caching of OIDCOAuthServerMetadataURL; thanks Lance Fannin
  * fix oidc_proto_html_post auto-post-submit so it no longer results in
    duplicate parentheses; closes #440; thanks @gobreak
  * fix RSA JWK x5c parsing issue (e.g. when parsing n fails): explicitly set the kid into to JWK
  * fix OIDCOAuthAcceptTokenAs post so POST data is propagated and not lost; see #443
  * fix JWT decryption crashing on non-null terminated input
  * fix not clearing claims in session when setting claims to null; closes #445; thanks @FilipVujicic

Features
  * support refresh and access tokens revocation from an RFC 7009 endpoint 
    upon OIDC session logout
  * make sure the content handler is called for every request to the 
    configured Redirect URI so all Apache processing is executed (e.g. 
    setting headers with mod_headers) before returning the response; thanks 
    Don Sengpiehl (NB: this may affect browser behavior and backwards 
    compatibility)
  * add ability to view session info in HTML via the session info hook via <redirect_uri)?info=html
  * enable per-provider signing and encryption keys in multi-provider setups (with limitations)
  * no longer use the fixup handler for environment variable setting but do it as part of the authn handler
  * add logout_on_error option to OIDCRefreshAccessTokenBeforeExpiry to 
    kill the session when refreshing an access token fails; thanks @rickyepoderi
  * be smart about picking the token endpoint authentication method when 
    not configured explicitly: don't choose the first one published by the OP 
    but prefer client_secret_basic if that is listed as well see: 
    panva/node-oidc-provider#514; thanks @richard-drummond and @panva

Other
  * remove option OIDCScrubRequestHeaders that allows for skipping 
    scrubbing request headers, thus avoiding potentially insecure setups
  * log the original URL for expired state cookies, useful for debugging 
    SPA/JS issues
  * add debug logs in oidc_proto_generate_random_string to allow for 
    spotting lack of entropy in the random number generator (on VM 
    environments) more easily
  * add USE_URANDOM compile time option to use /dev/urandom explicitly for 
    non-blocking random number generation: configure with 
    APXS2_OPTS="-DUSE_URANDOM"
  * allow removing an access token from the cache ("remove_at_cache") when 
    running in OAuth 2.0 RS mode only

Wed Mar 13 20:36:33 UTC 2019 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 2.3.11
  Features
  * dynamically pass query params to the authorization request
   + using OIDCAuthRequestParams foo=# and/or OIDCPathAuthRequestParams foo=#
  * add session expiry info to session info hook response
    + session inactivity key is timeout now (was exp)
    + session expiry key is exp
  Other
  * allow compilation without memcache support on older platforms
    not providing apr_memcache.h

------------------------------------------------------------------

    be duplicated
  * fix warning printout in oidc_delete_oldest_state_cookies

  * optionally delete the oldest state cookie(s)
