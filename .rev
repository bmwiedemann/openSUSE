    <comment>- Update to version 3.0.3
  * Improve decisions about where and how to label vertical scales
  * Update build support material and documentation to reflect the
    official release of Cap'n Proto 0.6 (which we can now use rather
    than depending on git builds)
  version 3.0.2:
  * Fix crash when changing parameters for spectrum view
  * Fix incorrect measure tool crosshairs in spectrum view
  * Update Russian and Czech UI translations (thanks to Alexandre
    Prokoudine and Pavel Fric respectively)
  version 3.0.1:
  * Update MIDI input driver layer
  version 3.0:
  * Add ability to record audio, and ability to change the audio
    device for playback or recording in the preferences
  * Add complete support for high-resolution (Hi-DPI or retina)
    displays, including for layer data rendering as well as UI
    controls and icons. This makes the biggest difference when using
    a retina Mac, on which previous versions did not render layer
    data at retina resolution, but it also improves scaling and
    rendering of UI elements on Hi-DPI displays on Windows and Linux
  * Add ability to export scalable (SVG) image files
  * Run plugins in a separate process, so that if a plugin crashes,
    it no longer brings down Sonic Visualiser with it. In every other
    respect the behaviour should be unchanged
  * Scan plugins on startup in a separate process, and report on any
    that crash or won't load
  * Add ability to open, display, and analyse very long audio files
    (of more than 2^32 sample frames)
  * Change mp3 file loading so as to compensate for encoder/decoder
    delay and padding (using &quot;gapless playback&quot; logic). While this
    is a real improvement, unfortunately it does mean that the
    initial padding in mp3 file load has changed from previous
    versions, which may mean some sessions saved in previous versions
    are no longer correctly aligned. It's not a great idea to use mp3
    as a file format of record, because of differences like this
    between decoders. The previous behaviour is still available as a
    preference.
  * Add new Hybrid normalisation type for spectrogram and colour 3d
    plot layers. This normalises each column to its peak value and
    then scales the normalised values by the log of the peak in order
    to restore some distinction in scale between columns with
    different levels. It can provide quite visually clear results.
  * Add function to subdivide time instant layers into regular
    intervals (and its inverse)
  * Add new preference for default colour scales
  * Add a basic ability to zoom (in the frequency axis) to the
    spectrum
  * Switch to using combined level/pan controls in layer property
    boxes and for the main volume control
  * Make CSV file reader better able to handle files with varying
    numbers of columns
  * Add &quot;What's New&quot; dialog
- Dropped sonic-visualiser-ld-X11-fix.patch and refreshed
  sonic-visualiser-remove-svcore-test.patch
- Added piper.capnp schema to generate sources without the
  hardcoded capnp 0.6.0
- Dropped sonic-visualiser.desktop
- Added fishsound requirement
- Remove mad conditional because it is always present
- Update to version 2.5
  * Add unit-converter dialog, for converting between various 
    pitch and timing units
  * Fix failure to reload note layers from session file
  * Use a more sensible scale for the play-speed dial
  * Fix crash when importing very wide CSV files
  * Fix generation of wrong layer type from some CSV files
  * Fix failure to export last instant in a time-instant layer
  version 2.4:
  * Fix a crash when rendering certain colour 3d plot layers
  version 2.3:
  * Add support for left/right scrolling using a two-finger 
    touchpad gesture (where available)
  * Make the octave numbering into a configurable option, and 
    change the default. Previously Sonic Visualiser labelled 
    middle-C as &quot;C3&quot;; now it labels middle-C as &quot;C4&quot;, a more
    common standard in the world outside MIDI sequencer
    software. The previous system is available as an option
    in the Preferences. This affects only the visible
    labels: there is no change to analysis or to the file 
    format
  * Sonify time-value layers. Any time-value curve whose scale 
    unit is set to Hz will now acquire a playback toggle
    control; this control is off by default, but if it is
    switched on, the curve will be played back using a
    variable-frequency sound generator
  * Add support for playback of note layers with non-MIDI 
    frequencies (formerly the note playback was limited to
    exact MIDI pitch)
  * Change the default playback sample for note layers from 
    piano to an electric piano with sustain. The piano sample
    is still available, and any sessions saved using it should
    continue to use it
  * Add a cancel button for Vamp plugin processing: currently,
    cancelling a transform results in a part-complete layer 
    rather than removing the results
  * Add keyboard shortcuts to cycle the current layer (in 
    addition to the existing ones to cycle the current pane)
  * Fix various bugs related to layer ordering: layer tabs 
    re-ordering themselves randomly when new layer added,
    layers being ordered randomly when saving and reloading
    a session
  * Fix incorrect interaction with non-Unicode usernames when 
    creating temporary and template directories on Windows
  * Shade the start and end of the main audio file, to make 
    them easier to see for files that start or end in silence
  * Speed up rendering and scrolling in time-value layers
  * Make it possible to import CSV files directly into Note 
    layers by adding Pitch as a data type in the CSV file
    import dialog
  * Fix play pointer jump to wrong frame when clicking on row 
    in the layer edit dialog
  * Fix problems with keyboard shortcuts when using Qt5 on 
    OS/X. This is the first release in which the official
    builds use Qt5 for all platforms.
  version 2.2:
  * Add a startup welcome dialog that also explains what SV 
    makes network connections for and allows user to forbid
    them
  * Add &quot;Export Audio Data&quot; feature
  * Show piano keyboard scale in note and time-value layers as 
    well as spectrogram, where vertical scale is log Hz; also
    show numerical scale in note and region layers when not 
    auto-aligned
  * Speed up CSV file import and avoid showing crazily wide 
    window for CSV file format dialog when file has lots of
    columns
  * Fix incorrectly saved window geometry when exiting from 
    maximised state
  * Reduce number of timer wakeups when idle
  * Add American English translation and make choice of 
    translation into a preference (defaulting to system locale)
  * Permit installation to non-default location with Windows 
    installer build
  version 2.1:
  * Build with support for hidpi (&quot;retina&quot;) text on OS/X
  * Fix very slow analysis when using Ogg or FLAC files decoded
    via libsndfile
  * Fix inaccurate scale auto-align between time-value layers 
    and others
  * Fix failure to open files specified on command line (or via
    Open With) on Windows
  * Reset cyclical counters and switch back to navigate mode 
    when a new session is started
  version 2.0.1:
  * Fix incorrect handling of FixedSampleRate outputs (Vamp 
    SDK fix)
  * Make it easier to see results from transforms that return 
    a single point
  * Make labelling clearer on time-value layers
  * Add discrete-curve mode for time-value layers (for curves 
    with gaps)
  * Update code to build against Qt5
  version  2.0:
  * Fix incorrect samplerate in reading m4a files on OS/X
  version 1.9:
  * Support 64-bit builds on OS/X (using CoreAudio instead of
    obsolete QuickTime audio file reader)
  * Simplify RDF reading and fix some bugs. Now requires 
    Dataquay (http://breakfastquay.com/dataquay/) rather than
    using Redland directly. Release builds use Sord/Serd rather
    than Redland
  * Add a fullscreen mode on the F11 key
