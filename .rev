    <comment>Hello, I would like to submit my package to openSUSE:Factory.

gomuks is a TUI Matrix client written in Go. It's fairly promising and I have
been maintaining this package in my home project for a number of months -
it's picked up a number of users.

Please tell me if I've done something wrong with my package, as this is my
first time submitting to Factory.

Thanks in advance!

Best
