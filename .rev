    <comment>- Update to version 1.0.3:
  * Process redirects that can come from sregistry with a library:// URL.
  * Fix inspect --deffile and inspect --all to correctly show definition files
    in sandbox container images instead of empty output. This has a side effect
    of also fixing the storing of definition files in the metadata of sif files
    built by Apptainer, because that metadata is constructed by doing inspect
    --all.

    <comment>- Udpated to version 1.1.0-rc2 with following changes:
  * Fixed longstanding bug in the underlay logic when there are nested bind
    points separated by more than one path level, for example /var and
    /var/lib/yum, and the path didn't exist in the container image. The bug
    only caused an error when there was a directory in the container image that
    didn't exist on the host.
  * Improved wildcard matching in the %files directive of build definition
    files by replacing usage of sh with the mvdan.cc library.
  * Replaced checks for compatible filesystem types when using fuse-overlayfs
    with an INFO message when an incompatible filesystem type causes it to be
    unwritable by a fakeroot user.
  * The --nvccli option now works without --fakeroot. In that case the option
    can be used with --writable-tmpfs instead of --writable, and
    --writable-tmpfs is implied if neither option is given. Note that also
    /usr/bin has to be writable by the user, so without --fakeroot that
    probably requires a sandbox image that was built with --fix-perms.
  * The --nvccli option implies --nv.
  * Configure squashfuse to always show files to be owned by the current user.
    That's especially important for fakeroot to prevent most of the files from
    looking like they are owned by user 65534.
  * The fakeroot command can now be used even if $PATH is empty in the
    environment of the apptainer command.
  * Allow the newuidmap command to be missing if the current user is not listed
    in /etc/subuid.
  * Require the uidmap package in Debian packaging.
  * Improved error handling of unsupported pass protected PEM files with
    encrypted containers.
  * Ensure bootstrap_history directory is populated with previous definition
    files, present in source containers used in a build.
  * Add additional options to the build command for testing different fakeroot (forwarded request 998137 from mslacken)</comment>
