    <comment>- Trim filler wording from description.
- Update to version 0.3.2
  Important news:
  * This version fixes a major bug for the Scimitar Pro, causing
    the daemon to not properly interface with the mouse. This
    could require manually reflashing the mouse firmware if a
    firmware update was performed with 0.3.1 or earlier.
  * An updater has been created to more quickly push bugfixes to
    users, especially for those on macOS.
  * There is a new Space Invaders-like minigame that can be
    played as an animation, thanks to @mvladimirovich.
  Support for new devices:
  * Strafe RGB MK.2; by accidental omission from the previous
    release.
  * K66
  Important bugfixes:
  * The Scimitar Pro now defaults to v2.xx endpoints
  * The DPI LED on mice now changes in sniper mode
  * The GUI will warn if uinput cannot be loaded on Linux
  * The &quot;Save to Hardware&quot; button on the Scimitar and Glaive has
    been greyed out due to a current lack of support
  * Thanks to the efforts of @Kedstar99, the codebase compiles
    with much fewer warnings
  * Binding commands to wheels will now repeat properly
  * QuaZip is no longer required for daemon-only builds
  * KissFFT is now built as a static library
  * Symbolic links are now created in /dev/input/by-id for evdev
    users
  * Fixed a regression for devices using the legacy protocol
  Note for packagers:
  * If ckb-next is updated through a package management system,
    `-DDISABLE_UPDATER=1` should be passed to CMake
  version 0.3.1
  Support for new devices:
  * K70 RGB MK.2
