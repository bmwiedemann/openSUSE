Novell Software License Agreement

PLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY. BY DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING OR OTHERWISE USING THE SOFTWARE (INCLUDING ITS COMPONENTS), YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THESE TERMS, DO NOT DOWNLOAD, INSTALL OR USE THE SOFTWARE AND, IF APPLICABLE, RETURN THE ENTIRE UNUSED PACKAGE TO THE RESELLER WITH YOUR RECEIPT FOR A REFUND. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PERMITTED IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE SOFTWARE MAY NOT BE FURTHER DISTRIBUTED WITHOUT PRIOR WRITTEN AUTHORIZATION FROM NOVELL.

The Software is a modular operating system. Most of the components are open source packages, developed independently, and accompanied by separate license terms; the Software as a whole is a collective work of Novell. Your license rights with respect to individual components accompanied by separate license terms are defined by those terms; nothing in this Agreement (including, for example, the "Other License Terms and Restrictions," below) shall restrict, limit, or otherwise affect any rights or obligations You may have, or conditions to which You may be subject, under such license terms.

RIGHTS AND LICENSES

This Novell Software License Agreement ("Agreement") is a legal agreement between You (an entity or a person) and Novell, Inc. ("Novell") with respect to the software product identified in the title of this Agreement, media (if any) and accompanying documentation (collectively the "Software").

You may make and distribute outside Your Organization an unlimited number of copies of the Software.

You may modify the Software, and distribute outside Your Organization an unlimited number of copies of the modified Software, provided that: a) You remove all Novell trademarks and logos from the Software and do not use any Novell trademarks or logos in distributing the modified Software (Novell trademarks and logos include, but are not limited to, 'Novell', 'SUSE', and the SUSE gecko drawing.); OR, b) You agree to and comply with the requirements set forth in the redistribution program, the terms and conditions of which are set forth at http://www.opensuse.org/Legal.

You may make and use unlimited copies of the Software for Your distribution and use within Your Organization.

The term "Organization" means a legal entity, excluding subsidiaries and affiliates with a separate existence for tax purposes or for legal personality purposes. An example of an Organization in the private sector would be a corporation, partnership, or trust, excluding any subsidiaries or affiliates of the organization with a separate tax identification number or company registration number. In the public sector, an example of Organization would be a specific government body or local government authority.

While the license terms for a component may authorize You to distribute the component, You may not use any Novell trademarks and logos in distributing the component, whether or not the component contains Novell marks.

OTHER LICENSE TERMS AND RESTRICTIONS

The Software is protected by the copyright laws and treaties of the United States ("U.S.") and other countries and is subject to the terms of this Agreement. The Software is licensed to You, not sold.

The Software may be bundled with other software programs ("Bundled Programs"). Your license rights with respect to Bundled Programs accompanied by separate license terms are defined by those terms; nothing in this Agreement shall restrict, limit, or otherwise affect any rights or obligations You may have, or conditions to which You may be subject, under such license terms.

Novell reserves all rights not expressly granted to You. You may not: (1) reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the Software except and only to the extent it is expressly permitted by applicable law or the license terms accompanying a component of the Software; or (2) transfer the Software or Your license rights under this Agreement, in whole or in part.

MAINTENANCE AND SUPPORT

Novell has no obligation to provide maintenance or support for the Software.

OWNERSHIP RIGHTS

No title to or ownership of the Software is transferred to You. Novell and/or its licensors owns and retains all title and ownership of all intellectual property rights in the Software, including any adaptations or copies. You acquire only a license to use the Software.

LIMITED WARRANTY

For ninety (90) days from Your date of purchase or download, Novell warrants that (1) any media on which the Software is delivered is free from physical defects; and (2) the Software will substantially conform to the documentation accompanying the Software. If the defective items are returned to Novell or if You report the nonconformity to Novell within ninety (90) days from the date of purchase, Novell will at its sole discretion either resolve the nonconformity or refund the license fees You paid for the Software. Any misuse or unauthorized modification of the Software voids this warranty. THE FOREGOING WARRANTY IS YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY AND IS IN LIEU OF ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. (The foregoing warranty does not apply to Software provided free of charge. SUCH SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND.)

THE SOFTWARE IS NOT DESIGNED, MANUFACTURED OR INTENDED FOR USE OR DISTRIBUTION WITH ON-LINE CONTROL EQUIPMENT IN HAZARDOUS ENVIRONMENTS REQUIRING FAIL-SAFE PERFORMANCE, SUCH AS IN THE OPERATION OF NUCLEAR FACILITIES, AIRCRAFT NAVIGATION, COMMUNICATION, OR CONTROL SYSTEMS, DIRECT LIFE SUPPORT MACHINES, WEAPONS SYSTEMS, OR OTHER USES IN WHICH FAILURE OF THE SOFTWARE COULD LEAD DIRECTLY TO DEATH, PERSONAL INJURY, OR SEVERE PHYSICAL OR ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE.

THE SOFTWARE IS ONLY COMPATIBLE WITH CERTAIN COMPUTERS AND OPERATING SYSTEMS. THE SOFTWARE IS NOT WARRANTED FOR NON-COMPATIBLE SYSTEMS. Call Novell or Your dealer for information about compatibility.

Non-Novell Products. The Software may include or be bundled with hardware or other software programs licensed or sold by a licensor other than Novell. NOVELL DOES NOT WARRANT NON-NOVELL PRODUCTS. ANY SUCH PRODUCTS ARE PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS. ANY WARRANTY SERVICE FOR NON-NOVELL PRODUCTS IS PROVIDED BY THE PRODUCT LICENSOR IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE APPLICABLE LICENSOR WARRANTY.

EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE RESTRICTED BY LAW, NOVELL DISCLAIMS AND EXCLUDES ANY AND ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES INCLUDING ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. NOVELL MAKES NO WARRANTY, REPRESENTATION OR PROMISE NOT EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS LIMITED WARRANTY. NOVELL DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL SATISFY YOUR REQUIREMENTS OR THAT THE OPERATION OF THE SOFTWARE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED. Some jurisdictions do not allow certain disclaimers and limitations of warranties, so portions of the above limitations may not apply to You. This limited warranty gives You specific rights and You may also have other rights which vary from state to state.

LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

(a) Consequential Losses. NEITHER NOVELL NOR ANY OF ITS LICENSORS, SUBSIDIARIES, OR EMPLOYEES WILL IN ANY CASE BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, TORT, ECONOMIC OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOSS OF PROFITS, BUSINESS OR DATA, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF THOSE DAMAGES.

(b) Direct Damages. IN NO EVENT WILL NOVELL'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR DIRECT DAMAGES TO PROPERTY OR PERSON (WHETHER IN ONE INSTANCE OR A SERIES OF INSTANCES) EXCEED 1.25 TIMES THE AMOUNT PAID BY YOU FOR THE SOFTWARE OUT OF WHICH SUCH CLAIM AROSE [OR $50 (U.S.) IF YOU RECEIVED THE SOFTWARE FREE OF CHARGE]. The above exclusions and limitations will not apply to claims relating to death or personal injury. In those jurisdictions that do not allow the exclusion or limitation of damages, Novell's liability shall be limited or excluded to the maximum extent allowed within those jurisdictions.

GENERAL TERMS

You may not, without Novell's prior written consent not to be unreasonably withheld, publish or disclose to any third party the results of any benchmark test of the Software. If You are a vendor of products that are functionally similar to or compete with the Software ("Similar Products"), or are acting on behalf of such a vendor, and You publish or disclose benchmark information on the Software in violation of this restriction, then notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Similar Product's end user license agreement, and in addition to any other remedies Novell may have, Novell shall have the right to perform benchmark testing on Similar Products and to disclose and publish that benchmark information and You hereby represent that You have authority to grant such right to Novell.

Transfer. This Agreement may not be transferred or assigned without the prior written approval of Novell.
