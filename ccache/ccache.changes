- Fix upstream urls

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May  1 16:35:56 UTC 2019 -  <l.lunak@centrum.cz>

- Update URLs in the .spec file
- Update to version 3.7.1
- Changes for version 3.7.1
  * Fixed a problem when using the compiler option `-MF /dev/null`.
  * Long commandlines are now handled gracefully on Windows by using 
    the `@file` syntax to avoid hitting the commandline size limit.
  * Fixed complaint from GCC 9’s `-Werror=format-overflow` when 
    compiling ccache itself.
- Changes for version 3.7
  * Fixed crash when the debug mode is enabled and the output file is 
    in a non-writable directory, e.g. when the output file is `/dev/null`.
  * Fixed an issue when printing very large log messages to the debug 
    log.
  * Fixed bugs related to support for `-gsplit-dwarf`. Previously 
    ccache could produce an incorrect link to the `.dwo` file in the 
    `.o` file.
  * Compilations with /dev/null as the input file are now cached.
  * ccache has learned how to contruct the object filename if no `-o` 
    option is given and the source filename does not include a `.` or 
    ends with a `.`.
  * Fixed a temporary file leak when the depend mode is enabled and 
    the compiler produces standard error output.
  * Fixed a bug in the depend mode where a manifest hash only could 
    be associated with one set of header dependencies.
  * Manifest files did not get marked as used on direct cache hits, 
    so the LRU cache cleanup would incorrectly remove them eventually. 
    This has been fixed.
  * The rewriting of absolute paths into relative paths in the 
    dependency file has been enabled in the depend mode as well.
  * ccache now ignores unknown keys in configuration files for 
    forward compatibility.
  * Rearranged command-line options into sections in the help text.
  * Documented the previously undocumented `--dump-manifest` and 
    `--hash-file` options (only useful for debugging ccache itself).
  * Added missing documentation for the command-line option 
    `-k/--get-config` added in ccache 3.5.
  * Renamed the `--print-config` command to `--show-config`.
  * Added a new `--print-stats` command that prints statistics 
    counters in machine-parsable (tab-separated) format.
  * ccache no longer creates a missing output directory, thus 
    mimicking the compiler behavior for `-o out/obj.o` when “out” 
    doesn’t exist.
  * `-fdebug-prefix-map=ARG`, `-ffile-prefix-map=ARG` and 
    `-fmacro-prefix-map=ARG` are now included in the hash, but only 
    the part before “ARG”. This fixes a bug where compiler feature 
    detection of said flags would not work correctly with ccache.
  * Bail out on too hard compiler option `-gtoggle`.
  * Bail out on too hard Clang options `--analyze` and `-analyze`.
  * Improved debug logging of file hashes in depend mode.
  * Improved handling of various `-g*` options. In particular, ccache 
    now understands that `-g0` cancels out previous `-g* options`.
  * Worked around a problem with Automake related to `.d` files when 
    using the hard link mode.
  * Added opt-in (at configure time) support for enabling trace logs 
    for profiling ccache itself. See `doc/DEVELOPER.md` in the code 
    tree for more information
  * Removed support for Fortran 77 again. Some Fortran support was 
    added in ccache 3.3, but the implementation did not work when 
    Fortran modules are involved.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 31 10:36:48 UTC 2019 - kstreitova@suse.com

- Update to version 3.6
- Changes for version 3.6
  * ccache now has an opt-in ``depend mode'' 
  * Added support for GCC's `-ffile-prefix-map` option
  * Added support for multiple `-fsanitize-blacklist` arguments
  * ccache now includes the environment variables `LANG`, `LC_ALL`,
   `LC_CTYPE` and `LC_MESSAGES` in the hash since they may affect
    localization of compiler warning messages
  * Fixed a problem due to Clang overwriting the output file when
    compiling an assembler file
  * Clarified the manual to explain the reasoning behind the
    “file_macro” sloppiness setting in a better way
  * ccache now handles several levels of nonexistent directories
    when rewriting absolute paths to relative
  * A new sloppiness setting `clang_index_store` makes ccache skip
    the Clang compiler option `-index-store-path` and its argument
    when computing the manifest hash
  * Rename sloppiness `no_system_headers` to `system_headers` for
    consistency with other options
  * The GCC variables “DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT” and “SUNPRO_DEPENDENCIES”
    are now supported correctly.
  * The algorithm that scans for `__DATE_` and `__TIME__` tokens in
    the hashed source code now doesn't produce false positives for
    tokens where `__DATE__` or `__TIME__` is a substring
- Changes for version 3.5.1 
  * Added missing getopt_long.c source file to release archive
  * Fixed (harmless) compiler warnings when building ccache object
    files
  * CFLAGS is no longer passed to the linker when linking ccache
  * Improved development mode build flags

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 22 06:53:16 UTC 2018 - Martin Pluskal <mpluskal@suse.com>

- Make sure bundled zlib is not used
- Make building more verbose

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 22 06:38:20 UTC 2018 - sean@suspend.net

- Update to version 3.5
  * Added a boolean debug (CCACHE_DEBUG) configuration option
  * Renamed CCACHE_CC to CCACHE_COMPILER
  * Added a new command-line option -k/--get-config
  * Improved performance substantially when using hash_dir = false
  * Renamed "stats zero time" to "stats zeroed"
  * Added file_state_matches_ctime option to disable ctime check

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul 11 08:41:42 UTC 2018 - mpluskal@suse.com

- Enable testsuite

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr 17 11:52:37 UTC 2018 - kstreitova@suse.com

- Update to version 3.4.2 [bsc#1089879]
  * The cleanup algorithm has been fixed to not misbehave when
    files are removed by another process while the cleanup process
    is running. Previously, too many files could be removed from
    the cache if multiple cleanup processes were triggered at the
    same time, in extreme cases trimming the cache to a much
    smaller size than the configured limits.
  * Correctly hash preprocessed headers located in a
    “.gch directory”. Previously, ccache would not pick up changes
    to such precompiled headers, risking false positive cache hits.
  * Fixed build failure when using the bundled zlib sources.
  * ccache 3.3.5 added a workaround for not triggering Clang errors
    when a precompiled header’s dependency has an updated timestamp
    (but identical content). That workaround is now only applied
    when the compiler is Clang.
  * Made it possible to perform out-of-source builds in dev mode
    again.
- AUTHORS.*, MANUAL.* and NEWS.* files are now located in the doc
  directory

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar 15 11:10:32 UTC 2018 - mpluskal@suse.com

- Update to version 3.4.1:
  * Fixed printing of version number in ccache --version.
- Changes for version 3.4.0:
  * The compiler option form --sysroot arg is now handled like the
    documented --sysroot=arg form.
  * Added support for caching .su files generated by GCC flag
    -fstack-usage.
  * ccache should now work with distcc’s “pump” wrapper.
  * The optional unifier is no longer disabled when the direct mode
    is enabled.
  * Added support for nvcc compiler options --compiler-bindir/-ccbin,
    --output-directory/-odir and --libdevice-directory/-ldir.
  * Boolean environment variable settings no longer accept the
    following (case-insensitive) values: 0, false, disable and no.
    All other values are accepted and taken to mean “true”. This is
    to stop users from setting e.g. CCACHE_DISABLE=0 and then
    expect the cache to be used.
  * Improved support for run_second_cpp = false: If combined with
    passing -fdirectives-only (GCC) or frewrite-includes (Clang) to
    the compiler, diagnostics warnings and similar will be correct.
  * An implicit -MQ is now passed to the preprocessor only if the
    object file extension is non-standard. This should make it
    easier to use EDG-based compilers (e.g. GHS) which don’t
    understand -MQ.
  * ccache now treats an unreadable configuration file just like a
    missing configuration file.
  * Documented more pitfalls with enabling hard_links
    (CCACHE_HARDLINK).
  * Documented caveats related to colored warnings from compilers.
  * File size and number counters are now updated correctly when
    files are overwritten in the cache, e.g. when using
    CCACHE_RECACHE.
  * run_second_cpp is now forced for nvcc.
  * Fixed how the nvcc options -optf and -odir are handled.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Feb  3 04:53:41 UTC 2018 - avindra@opensuse.org

- Update to version 3.3.6:
  * Improved instructions on how to get cache hits between different
    working directories.
- Changes for version 3.3.5:
  * Documented how automatic cache cleanup works.
  * Fixed a regression where the original order of debug options
    could be lost. This reverts the “Improved parsing of -g*
    options” feature in ccache 3.3.
  * Multiple -fdebug-prefix-map options should now be handled
    correctly.
  * Fixed matching of directories in the ignore_headers_in_manifest
    configuration option.
  * Fixed detection of missing argument to -opt/--options-file.
  * ccache now bails out when building a precompiled header if any
    of the corresponding header files have an updated timestamp.
    This fixes complaints from clang.
  * Fixed a bug related to erroneously storing a dependency file
    with absolute paths in the cache on a preprocessed hit.
  * ccache -c/--cleanup now works like documented: it just
    recalculates size counters and trims the cache to not exceed
    the max size and file number limits. Previously, the forced
    cleanup took “limit_multiple” into account, so that ccache
    -c/--cleanup by default would trim the cache to 80% of the max
    limit.
  * ccache no longer ignores linker arguments for clang since clang
    warns about them.
  * Plugged a couple of file descriptor leaks.
  * Fixed a bug where ccache would skip hashing the compiler
    argument following a -fno-working-directory,
    -fworking-directory, -nostdinc, -nostdinc++, -remap or
    -trigraphs option in preprocessor mode.
- cleanup with spec-cleaner

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr  5 09:25:15 UTC 2017 - mpluskal@suse.com

- Update to version 3.3.4:
  * Documented the different cache statistics counters.
  * Fixed a regression in ccache 3.3 related to potentially bad
    content of dependency files when compiling identical source
    code but with different source paths. This was only partially
    fixed in 3.3.2 and reverts the new “Names of included files are
    no longer included in the hash of the compiler’s preprocessed
    output” feature in 3.3.
  * Corrected statistics counter for -optf/--options-file failure.
  * Fixed undefined behavior warnings in ccache found by
    -fsanitize=undefined.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 19 21:41:05 UTC 2017 - asn@cryptomilk.org

- Update to version 3.3.3
  * ccache now detects usage of .incbin assembler directives in
    the source code and avoids caching such compilations.
- Changes for version 3.3.2:
  * Fixed a regression in ccache 3.3 related to potentially bad
    content of dependency files when compiling identical source
    code but with different source paths.
  * Fixed a regression in ccache 3.3.1: ccache could get confused
    when using the compiler option -Wp, to pass multiple options
    to the preprocessor, resulting in missing dependency files
    from direct mode cache hits.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Sep 11 07:42:26 UTC 2016 - mpluskal@suse.com

- Update to version 3.3.1:
  * Fixed a problem in the “multiple -arch options” support
    introduced in 3.3. When using the direct mode (the default),
    different combinations of -arch options were not detected
    properly.
  * Fixed an issue when compiler option -Wp,-MT,path is used
    instead of -MT path (and similar for -MF, -MP and -MQ) and
    run_second_cpp (CCACHE_CPP2) is enabled.
- Changes for version 3.3.0:
  * A C99-compatible compiler is now required to build ccache.
  * The configuration option run_second_cpp (CCACHE_CPP2) now
    defaults to true. This improves ccache’s out-of-the-box 
    experience for compilers that can’t compile their own
    preprocessed output with the same outcome as if they compiled
    the real source code directly, e.g. newer versions of GCC and
    Clang.
  * The configuration option hash_dir (CCACHE_HASHDIR) now defaults
    to true.
  * Added a new ignore_headers_in_manifest configuration option, 
    which specifies headers that should be ignored in the direct
    mode.
  * Added a new prefix_command_cpp (CCACHE_PREFIX_CPP) configuration
    option, which specifies one or several prefixes to add to the
    command line ccache uses when invoking the preprocessor.
  * Added a new limit_multiple (CCACHE_LIMIT_MULTIPLE) configuration
    option, which specifies how much of the cache to remove when
    cleaning.
  * Added a new keep_comments_cpp (CCACHE_COMMENTS) configuration
    option, which tells ccache not to discard the comments before
    hashing preprocessor output. This can be used to check
    documentation with -Wdocumentation.
  * Added a new sloppiness option no_system_headers, which tells
    ccache not to include system headers in manifest files.
  * Added a new statistics counter that tracks the number of
    performed cleanups due to the cache size being over the limit.
    The value is shown in the output of “ccache -s”.
  * Added support for relocating debug info directory using
    -fdebug-prefix-map. This allows for cache hits even when
    hash_dir is used in combination with base_dir.
  * Added a new “cache hit rate” field to the output of “ccache -s”.
  * Added support for caching compilation of assembler code produced
    by e.g. “gcc -S file.c”.
  * Added support for cuda including the -optf/--options-file option.
  * Added support for Fortran 77.
  * Added support for multiple -arch options to produce "fat binaries".
  * Multiple identical -arch arguments are now handled without bailing.
  * The concatenated form of some long compiler options is now
    recognized, for example when using -isystemPATH instead of
    -isystem PATH.
  * If hard-linking is enabled and but fails (e.g. due to
    cross-device linking), ccache now falls back to copying instead
    of running the compiler.
  * Made the hash_dir option only have effect when generating debug
    info.
  * ccache now knows how to convert absolute paths to relative
    paths inside dependency files when using base_dir.
  * Improved parsing of -g* options.
  * Made ccache understand -Wp,-D* options.
  * ccache now understands the undocumented -coverage (only one
    dash) GCC option.
  * Names of included files are no longer included in the hash of
    the compiler’s preprocessed output. This leads to more
    potential cache hits when not using the direct mode.
  * Increased buffer size used when reading file data. This
    improves performance slightly.
- Changes for version 3.2.8:
  * Bail out on too hard compiler option -P.
  * Fixed clang test suite when running on Linux.
  * Fixed build and test for MinGW32 and Windows.
- Add fortran amd objc symlinks

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug 26 13:27:20 UTC 2016 - tchvatal@suse.com

- Version update to 3.2.7:
  - Fixed build problem on QNX, which lacks ``SA_RESTART''.
  - Bail out on compiler option `-fstack-usage` since it creates a `.su` file
    which ccache currently doesn't handle.
  - Fixed a bug where (due to ccache rewriting paths) the compiler could choose
    incorrect include files if `CCACHE_BASEDIR` is used and the source file path
    is absolute and is a symlink.
  - Fixed a bug which could lead to false cache hits for compiler command lines
    with a missing argument to an option that takes an argument.
  - ccache now knows how to work around a glitch in the output of GCC 6's
    preprocessor.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug 26 13:21:18 UTC 2016 - tchvatal@suse.com

- Create basic symlinks for clang and regular cc calls for ccache
  * this makes it easier to use ccache with osc build

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul  8 18:05:38 UTC 2016 - mpluskal@suse.com

- Small spec file cleanup
- Disable testsuite as it is not reliable in OBS

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 28 07:17:22 UTC 2016 - idonmez@suse.com

- Update to 3.2.5
  * Only pass clang-specific -stdlib= to the preprocessor.
  * Improved handling of stale NFS handles.
  * Made it harder to misinterpret documentation of boolean
    environment settings' semantics.
  * Corrected "Performance" section in the manual regarding __DATE_,
    __TIME__ and __FILE__ macros.
  * Don’t (try to) update manifest file in “read-only” and 
    “read-only direct” modes.
  * Fixed a bug in caching of stat system calls in “file_stat_matches
    sloppiness mode”.
  * Fixed bug in hashing of clang plugins, leading to unnecessary
    cache misses.
  * Fixed --print-config to show “pch_defines sloppiness”.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct  8 20:32:17 UTC 2015 - mpluskal@suse.com

- Update to 3.2.4
  * Fixed build error related to zlib on systems with older make 
    versions (regression in ccache 3.2.3).
  * Made conversion-to-bool explicit to avoid build warnings (and 
    potential runtime errors) on legacy systems.
  * Improved signal handling: Kill compiler on SIGTERM; wait for 
    compiler to exit before exiting; die appropriately.
  * Minor fixes related to Windows support.
  * The correct compression level is now used if compression is 
    requested.
  * Fixed a bug where cache cleanup could be run too early for 
    caches larger than 64 GiB on 32-bit systems.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Aug 22 20:36:16 UTC 2015 - astieger@suse.com

- update to 3.2.3:
  * Added support for compiler option -gsplit-dwarf.
  * Support external zlib in nonstandard directory.
  * Avoid calling exit() inside an exit handler.
  * Let exit handler terminate properly.
  * Bail out on compiler option --save-temps in addition to
    -save-temps.
  * Only log "Disabling direct mode" once when failing to read
    potential include files.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May 22 07:14:06 UTC 2015 - mpluskal@suse.com

- Update to 3.2.2
  * Added support for `CCACHE_COMPILERCHECK=string:<value>`. This 
    is a faster alternative to `CCACHE_COMPILERCHECK=<command>` if 
    the command's output can be precalculated by the build system.
  * Add support for caching code coverage results (compiling for 
    gcov).
  * Fixed bug which could result in false cache hits when source 
    code contains `'"'` followed by `" /*"` or `" //"` (with 
    variations).
  * Made hash of cached result created with and without 
    `CCACHE_CPP2` different. This makes it possible to rebuild 
    with `CCACHE_CPP2` set without having to clear the cache to 
    get new results.
  * Don't try to reset a non-existing stats file. This avoids 
    ``No such file or directory'' messages in the ccache log when 
    the cache directory doesn't exist.
  * Fixed a bug where ccache deleted clang diagnostics after 
    compiler failures.
  * Avoid performing an unnecessary copy of the object file on a 
    cache miss.
  * Bail out on too hard compiler option `-fmodules`.
  * Bail out on too hard compiler option `-fplugin=libcc1plugin` 
    (interaction with GDB).
  * Fixed build error when compiling ccache with recent clang 
    versions.
  * Removed signal-unsafe code from signal handler.
  * Corrected logic for when to output cached stderr.
  * Wipe the whole cached result on failure retrieving a cached 
    file.
  * Fixed build error when compiling ccache with recent clang 
    versions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May 15 10:08:14 UTC 2015 - mvyskocil@opensuse.org

- Add the compat symlinks for gcc/g++ to libdir, so prepending
  libdir to PATH enabled ccache by default

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb 20 18:12:09 UTC 2015 - mpluskal@suse.com

- Add gpg signature
- Remove ccache-gcc48.patch and xclang.patch (both are already 
  present in current release)
- On i586, use only small testsuite (quicktest) full testsuite
  fails (https://bugzilla.samba.org/show_bug.cgi?id=11109)
- Update to 3.2.1:
  * Added support for configuring ccache via one or several 
    configuration files instead of via environment variables. 
    Environment variables still have priority but are no longer 
    the recommended way of customizing ccache behavior. See the 
    manual for more information.
  * Added support for compiler error/warning messages with color.
  * Made creation of temporary directories and cache directories 
    smarter to avoid unnecessary stat calls.
  * Improved efficiency of the algorithm that scans for 
    __DATE_ and __TIME__ tokens in the hashed source code.
  * Added support for several binaries (separated by space) in 
    CCACHE_PREFIX.
  * The -c option is no longer passed to the preprocessor. 
    This fixes problems with clang and Solaris’s C++ compiler.
  * ccache no longer passes preprocessor options like -D and -I to 
    the compiler when compiling preprocessed output. This fixes 
    warnings emitted by clang.
  * Compiler options -fprofile-generate, -fprofile-arcs, 
    -fprofile-use and -fbranch-probabilities are now handled 
    without bailing.
  * Added support for clang’s --serialize-diagnostic option, 
    storing the diagnostic file (.dia) in the cache.
  * Added support for precompiled headers when using clang.
  * Changed the -x language option to use the new objective C 
    standard for GCC and clang.
  * On a cache miss, ccache now instructs the compiler to create 
    the object file at the real destination and then copies the 
    file into the cache instead of the other way around. This is 
    needed to support compiler options like -fprofile-arcs 
    and --serialize-diagnostics.
  * ccache now checks that included files' ctimes aren’t too new. 
    This check can be turned off by adding include_file_ctime 
    to the “ccache sloppinessâhe filename part of options 
    like -Wp,-MDfilename is no longer included in the hash 
    since the filename doesn’t have any bearing on the result.
  * Added a “read-only directâefault cache size is now 5 GB 
    (was previously 1 GiB).
  * Added support for @file and -@file arguments (reading options 
    from a file).
  * Bail out on too hard compiler option -Wp,-P.
  * Optimized MD4 calculation code on little-endian systems.
  * Various improvements and fixes on win32.
  * Improved logging to the ccache log file.
  * Added --dump-manifest command-line option for debugging purposes.
  * Added --with-bundled-zlib configure option.
  * Upgraded bundled zlib to version 1.2.8.
  * Improved dev.mk to be more platform independent.
  * Made the test suite work with clang and gcc-llvm on OS X.
  * Various other improvements of the test suite.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun 25 08:44:41 UTC 2013 - pgajdos@suse.com

- fixed build with gcc 4.8
  * ccache-gcc48.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Feb 23 20:55:27 UTC 2013 - asterios.dramis@gmail.com

- Update to 3.1.9:
  - The EAGAIN signal is now handled correctly when emitting cached stderr
    output. This fixes a problem triggered by large error outputs from the
    compiler.
  - Subdirectories in the cache are no longer created in read-only mode.
  - Fixed so that ccache's log file descriptor is not made available to the
    compiler.
  - Improved error reporting when failing to create temporary stdout/stderr
    files when executing the compiler.
  - Disappearing temporary stdout/stderr files are now handled gracefully.
  - Fixed test suite to work on ecryptfs.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan  4 23:37:14 UTC 2013 - llunak@suse.com

- Add xclang.patch: support -Xclang option

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov  9 13:37:23 UTC 2012 - idonmez@suse.com

- Implement %check
- Don't install INSTALL.* files

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Aug 11 15:22:26 UTC 2012 - puzel@suse.com

- update to ccache-3.1.8 
  - Made paths to dependency files relative in order to increase
    cache hits.
  - Added work-around to make ccache work with buggy GCC 4.1 when
    creating a pre-compiled header.
  - Clang plugins are now hashed to catch plugin upgrades.
  - Fixed crash when the current working directory has been
    removed.
  - Fixed crash when stderr is closed.
  - Corrected a corner case when parsing backslash escapes in
    string literals.
  - Paths are now correctly canonicalized when computing paths
    relative to the base directory.
  - Made git version macro work when compiling outside of the
    source directory.
  - Fixed `static_assert` macro definition clash with GCC 4.7.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan  9 07:30:04 UTC 2012 - puzel@suse.com

- update to ccache-3.1.7 
  - Non-writable `CCACHE_DIR` is now handled gracefully when
    `CCACHE_READONLY` is set.
  - Made failure to create files (typically due to bad directory
    permissions) in the cache directory fatal. Previously, such
    failures were silently and erroneously flagged as "compiler
    produced stdout".
  - Both the `-specs=file` and `--specs=file` forms are now
    recognized.
  - Added recognition and hashing of GCC plugins specified with
    `-fplugin=file`.
  - `CCACHE_COMPILERCHECK` now also determines how to hash explicit
    specs files (`-specs=file`).
  - Added `CPATH`, `C_INCLUDE_PATH` and similar environment
    variables to the hash to avoid false cache hits when such
    variables have changed.
  - Corrected log message when unify mode is enabled.
  - Reverted the GCC bug compatibility introduced in ccache 3.1.5
    for `-MT`/`-MQ` options with concatenated arguments. (The bug

    mode hits.
  - ccache now copes with file systems that don't know about symbolic links.
  - The file handle in now correctly closed on write error when trying to
    create a cache dir tag.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov  8 09:46:57 UTC 2010 - puzel@novell.com

- update to ccache-3.1.1 
  - ccache now falls back to preprocessor mode when a non-regular
    include file (device, socket, etc) has been detected so that
    potential hanging due to blocking reads is avoided.
  - CRC errors are now detected when decompressing compressed files
    in the cache.
  - Fixed potential object file corruption race on NFS.
  - Minor documentation corrections.
  - Fixed configure detection of ar.
  - ccache development version (set by dev.mk) now works with gits
    whose `describe` command doesn't understand `--dirty`.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep 17 09:22:59 UTC 2010 - puzel@novell.com

- update to ccache-3.1 
 - features:
  - Added support for hashing the output of a custom command
    (e.g. `$compiler --version`) to identify the compiler
    instead of stat-ing or hashing the compiler binary.   
  - Added support for caching compilations that use precompiled
    headers.
  - Locking of the files containing statistics counters is now
    done using symlinks instead of POSIX locks.  
  - Manifest files are now updated without the need of taking
    locks.
  - Added `.cp` and `.CP` as known C++ suffixes.
  - Improved logging.
 - bugfixes:
  - Non-fatal error messages are now never printed to stderr but
    logged instead.
  - Fixed a bug affecting failing commands when `--ccache-skip` is
    used.
  - Made `--ccache-skip` work for all options.
  - EINTR is now handled correctly.

- update to ccache-3.0.1 
 - bugfixes:
  - The statistics counter ``called for link'' is now correctly 
    updated when linking with a single object file.
  - Fixed a problem with out-of-source builds.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul 12 11:43:54 UTC 2010 - puzel@novell.com

- update to ccache-3.0
 - notable changes:
 - The way the hashes are calculated has changed, so you won't get
   cache hits for compilation results stored by older ccache
   versions. Because of this, you might as well clear the old
   cache directory with `ccache --clear` if you want, unless you
   plan to keep using an older ccache version.
 - ccache now has a ``direct mode'' where it computes a hash of
   the source code (including all included files) and compiler
   options without running the preprocessor. By not running the
   preprocessor, CPU usage is reduced; the speed is somewhere
   between 1 and 5 times that of ccache running in traditional
   mode, depending on the circumstances. The speedup will be
   higher when I/O is fast (e.g., when files are in the disk
   cache).  The direct mode can be disabled by setting
   +CCACHE_NODIRECT+.
 - Support has been added for rewriting absolute paths to relative
   paths when hashing, in order to increase cache hit rate when
   building the same source code in different directories even
   when compiling with `-g` and when using absolute include
   directory paths. This is done by setting the `CCACHE_BASEDIR`
   environment variable to an absolute path that specifies which
   paths to rewrite.
 - Object files are now optionally stored compressed in the cache.
   The runtime cost is negligible, and more files will fit in the
   ccache directory and in the disk cache. Set `CCACHE_COMPRESS`
   to enable object file compression. Note that you can't use
   compression in combination with the hard link feature.
 - A `CCACHE_COMPILERCHECK` option has been added. This option
   tells ccache what compiler-identifying information to hash to
   ensure that results retrieved from the cache are accurate.
   Possible values are: none (don't hash anything), mtime (hash
   the compiler's mtime and size) and content (hash the content of
   the compiler binary). The default is mtime.
