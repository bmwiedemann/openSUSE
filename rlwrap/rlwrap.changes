- Add reproducible.patch to fix a build race (boo#1102408)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Sep  3 14:43:32 UTC 2017 - aavindraa@gmail.com

- Update to version 0.43:
 * New features
   - Filters can now be written in python 
   - Filters can respond to hotkeys (i.e. single keypresses bound to rlwrap-hotkey in .inputrc)
 * Bug fixes
   - rlwrap now always searches terminfo before termcap.
   - playing back a readline macro consisting of more than one line would crash rlwrap.
   - rlwrap --one-shot could accept more than one line when input in quick succession.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jan 18 21:41:44 UTC 2015 - sfalken@opensuse.org

- Update to version 0.42:
  + Changes from 0.37 to 0.40
    - configure will now find tgentent() in libtinfo
    - compiling with gcc -O2 made rlwrap hang after Ctrl-D on
      empty line
    - HP-UX 11 has weird tgentent() return values, confusing rlwrap
    - Solaris: rlwrap would sometimes fail with "TIOCSWINSZ failed
      on slave pty"
    - Single quote ' is now word-breaking by default
    - multi-line edit would mangle upper ASCII and UTF-8 (and still
      does that to UTF-16 :( )
    - added --extra-char-after-completion and --multi-line-ext
    - rlwrap now recognizes the 'rmcup' and 'rmkx' character
      sequences used by programs that use an alternate screen
      (like editors and pagers) to return from it.
    - configure will now correctly determine pty type on SCO
    - rlwrap --no-children would leak file descriptors to
      /proc/<command_pid>/wchan
    - non-ASCII characters in multi-lin input are no longer
      replaced by spaces after calling an external editor
    - running rlwrap within emacs would crash (division by zero)
      rlwrap now bails out whenever terminal width == 0
    - added --enable-proc-mountpoint config option to use alternate
      linux-like proc filesystems (like in FreeBSD) for finding 
      <command>s working dir (-c option) and kernel function in which
      <command> is sleeping (-N option)
    - added prototype for copy_without_ignore_markers, fixing a
      segfault on FreeBSD
    - Filters now get complete echo lines even if the echo comes
      back in chunks
  + Changes from 0.40 to 0.41
    - Slightly late SIGCHLD could cause an I/O error on master pty
    - Added -W (-polling) option to poll slave pty for changes in
      its interrupt character and ISIG flag.
    - if $TERM is not found in termcap/terminfo database, use vt100
  + Changes from 0.41 to 0.42
    - Added --mirror-arguments (-U) option
    - On SunOS tcgetattr(slave pty) failed with "Invalid argument"
    - If the completion list contained two words, one of which a
      prefix of the other (e.g. "sea" and "seagull") the shorter
      one would be skipped when displaying a list of completions
    - reading completion files (with the -f option, or from
      $RLWRAP_HOME/<command>_completions) could fail with an
      incorrect ENOENT ("No such file or directory")
    - rlwrap -z listing wouldn't list filters
    - When both master and slave pty are unfit for sensing slave
      commands terminal settings, rlwrap now bails out with an
      error "cannot determine terminal mode of slave command"
  + Dropped:
    - rlwrap-0.37.tar.bz2
  + Added:
    - rlwrap-0.42.tar.gz

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Sep 19 11:47:49 CEST 2010 - vuntz@opensuse.org

- Update to version 0.37:
  + Commands that emit "status lines" using backspaces and carriage
    returns could confuse rlwrap
  + rlwrap uses C strings internally, and thus cannot cope with
    command output that contains zero bytes (padding). It used to
    replace these with spaces, now the zero bytes are removed.
  + If the RLWRAP_HOME is set, but $RLWRAP_HOME doesn't exist,
    rlwrap will create it
  + Typo: SIGERR instead of SIG_ERR in signals.c

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr  6 14:40:29 UTC 2010 - hvogel@novell.com

- Update to version 0.36
 * When rlwrap kills itself after a command crash it will not dump
   core, in order to avoid clobbering command's core dump.
 * Many small improvements and fixes for multi-line input 
 * Many small fixes and improvements in signal handling 
 * Added --one-shot (-o) and --only-cook (-O) options
 * Added EXAMPLES section and -t option to rlwrap manpage
 * prefix arguments are now correctly reset
 * Hyphens in rlwrap manpage are now all properly escaped
 * Major new feature: filtering. Filters sit between rlwrap and the
   wrapped command, re-writing command output, input, prompts,
   history, and completion word lists. 
 * At program exit, rlwrap now outputs a newline only when the client 
   didn't.       
 * Added -g, -I, -N, -S, -w and -z options
 * -p option now takes colour names (-pYellow)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan 16 16:05:45 CET 2008 - hvogel@suse.de

- Update to version 0.30:
  * EOF on stdin (e.g. by pressing CTRL-D) would end prompt colouring.
  * added -q option 
  * added -A option to handle (ANSI-)coloured prompts
  * added -p option to colourise uncoloured prompts 
  * added -t option to set terminal type for client command
  * rlwrap now copies its terminal settings from the client
    even when this has put its terminal in single-keypress
    (uncooked) mode. A rlwrapped emacs will now respond to CTRL-C 
    and CTRL-G as it should.
  * error messages and warnings now include the rlwrap version number 
  * added a very simple custom malloc/free debugger for use with the 
    --debug option. Rather fragile and not well tested, use with care.
  * Whenever TERM is not set, rlwrap assumes vt100. Set TERM=dumb if
    you really have a dumb terminal.
  * rlwrap now leaves the handling of multi-line prompts and edit
    buffers to readline (except when in horizontal-scroll mode or when 
    configured with --enable-homegrown-redisplay).  
  * whenever --always-readline is set, SIGWINCH not passed to 
    client command immediately, but only *after* accepting a line.
  * --spy-on-readline now enabled by default
