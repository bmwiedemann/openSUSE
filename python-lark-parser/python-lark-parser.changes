- version update to 0.7.1
    Lark can now serialize its parsers, resulting in simplified stand-alone code.
    Bugfix for v_args (Issue #350)
    Improvements and bugfixes for importing rules from grammar files
    Performance improvement for the reconstructor feature
    New Earley implementation with SPPF support
    Added support for importing rules between grammars. The import mechanism
      is namespace-aware.
    Added the maybe_placeholders option, which causes optionals of the form
     [expr] to return None when not matched, instead of just not appearing.
     (optionals of the form expr? maintain the previous behavior of not
     appearing unless matched)
    Plenty of bugfixes, better errors, and better docs
