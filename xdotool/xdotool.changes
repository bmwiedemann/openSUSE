- update to 3.20160805.1
  * Fix release tool problem. cflags.sh was missing from the
    previous two releases. 
  * `make test-package-build` now works correctly on Fedora and OSX
- includes 3.20160804.2
  * Fix some bugs in the Makefile
- includes 3.20160804.1
  * Fix memory leaks in window search and charcode map lookups
  * xdotool selectwindow (xdo_select_window_with_click) now only
    selects the window if mouse button 1 is pressed. Any other
    buttons will cause this selection to be aborted.
  * Fix bug where `xdotool click` with --clearmodifiers can
    sometimes leave stuck keys or mouse buttons.
  * windowmove now supports coordinates as a percentage of screen
    size. For example, a move to 50% 50% would move the window
    such that the top-left corner of the window is in the center
    of the screen.
  * Typing commands (key and type) will now try to use XTEST
    instead of XSendEvent in a special circumstance. If the window
    id given (by window stack or the --window flag) is the currenly
    focused window, key sequences will be sent using XTEST.
  * getmouselocation, getwindowgeometry, and search commands: now
    supports --shell and --prefix for having stdout be consumable by
    bash or similar shells.
  * xdotool scripts such as running via `xdotool -` will now execute
    commands as lines of input are read. The previous behavior
    waited until stdin closed before executing anything.
- includes 3.20150503 ()
  * Fix sending wrong keys when using multiple keyboard layouts 
  * Add --repeat and --repeat-delay to allow repetition of a key
    sequence
  * Fix handling of empty files in type command
  * consume regexp argument only if present.
  * update URLs to Github
  * Changes determined via:
    https://github.com/jordansissel/xdotool/compare/65cb0b1...v3.20150503.1
with an optional delay in between each full sequence.
- drop _service file in favor of github release tarball
- use https for site
- cleanup with spec-cleaner
- add remove-dead-function.patch
  * removes reference to function in header file that was removed
