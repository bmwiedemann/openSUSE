- Modernize spec-file by calling spec-cleaner

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Oct 12 22:07:29 UTC 2014 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Add nautilus-terminal-vte2.91.patch: Fix usage with Vte 2.91.
- Add vte-devel BuildRequires: needed in order to be able to detect
  if we need to apply the patch during build. If vte-2.91.pc exist,
  we apply the patch and make the resulting package depend on
  Vte 2.91.

- Fix dependencies (bnc#807207):
  + Add gobject-introspection BuildRequires: Needed for the
    automatic typelib()-Requires generator.
  + Drop python-nautilus and python-gobject Requires: they are no
    longer needed, as nautilus-terminal was ported to pygobject. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- Update to a bzr checkout of the GNOME 3 port (revision 9 of the
  1.x branch):
  + Rewrite for GNOME 3 technologies.
- Add nautilus-terminal-gi-gobject.patch: finish port to pygobject
  3.0, which has some differences with pygobject 2.x.
- Add python-gobject Requires as introspection-based bindings are
  now used.
- Drop python-vte Requires since we don't want the
  non-introspection-based bindings.
- Add python-xdg Recommends: this is an optional dependency, to
  find the configuration file for this extension.
- Mark package as noarch.
- Add have_lang macro, and make all the lang subpackage handling
  depend on its value. Set it to 0 for now, since there is no
  translation in the new branch.
