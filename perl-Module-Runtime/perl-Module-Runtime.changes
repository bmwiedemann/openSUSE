   see /usr/share/doc/packages/perl-Module-Runtime/Changes

  version 0.016; 2017-10-17
  
    * port t/taint.t to Perl 5.27.5, where re-requiring an already-loaded
      module doesn't trigger tainting
  
    * skip t/taint.t if the perl empirically doesn't perform taint checks
      but the script got run anyway (which happens with an unsupported
      configuration of the Perl core which some people are using in the
      absence of a supported no-taint configuration)
  
    * in t/taint.t, use $^X rather than $ENV{PATH} as the primordial
      tainted value to taint a string being tested
  
    * in documentation, use four-column indentation for all verbatim
      material
  
    * in META.{yml,json}, point to public bug tracker
  
    * in META.json, specify type of public repository

- updated to 0.015
   see /usr/share/doc/packages/perl-Module-Runtime/Changes

  version 0.015; 2017-07-16
  
    * update test suite to not rely on . in @INC, which is no longer
      necessarily there from Perl 5.25.7
  
    * in documentation, warn about the security problem with
      use_package_optimistically()
  
    * declare correct version for Test::More dependency
  
    * generate "traditional" style of compatibility Makefile.PL, to
      permit building in environments that don't support Build.PL or
      configure_requires

Mon Feb 24 06:10:39 UTC 2014 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to 0.014
   * bugfix: suppress any CORE::GLOBAL::require override, where possible,
     to avoid use_package_optimistically() being misled into treating
     missing modules as broken
 
   * bugfix: in use_module() and use_package_optimistically(), pass a
     supplied VERSION parameter through for the version check even if it
     is undef
 
   * tighten use_package_optimistically()'s recognition of can't-locate
     errors (the same way that base.pm has recently been tightened),
     so that, when a module fails to load because a module that it uses
     isn't available, the outer module will be perceived as broken rather
     than missing
 
   * update documentation notes about the state of Unicode handling for
     module names
 
   * in META.{yml,json}, point to public git repository

- updated to 0.013
  * fix false failure of the test for lack of unintended dependencies
    that occurred on systems using a sitecustomize.pl

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb 13 09:03:02 UTC 2012 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to 0.012
   * work around Perl core bug [RT#68590] regarding leakage of %^H
     into modules being loaded
 
   * work around Perl core bug that made a failed module loading appear
     successful when re-requiring the same module
 
   * duplicate is_string() from Params::Classify, rather than importing it,
     to avoid circular dependency problems (affecting both installation
     and runtime)
 
   * duplicate minimal exporting behaviour from Exporter, and avoid using
     the "feature", "warnings", "strict", and "parent" pragmata, to allow
     for possible future use of this module by any infrastructure module
 
   * document core bug workarounds
 
   * document module name syntax more prominently, and discuss the state
     of Unicode handling
 
   * tweak documentation of use_package_optimistically()
 
   * test behaviour with tainted module name
 
   * test lack of unwanted eval frame around require
 
   * give test modules more meaningful names
 
   * convert .cvsignore to .gitignore
