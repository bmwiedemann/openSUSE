  TODO: default rbuf_max value maybe? how about reading large chunks in small parts?
  
  2.23 Sun Aug 28 11:30:33 CEST 2016
  	- relative redirects used the proxy schema instead of the request
            url schema to generate the new url, which is wrong (analyzed by Felix
            Ostmann).
          - fix download example (reported by Felix Ostmann).

 2.2  Mon Jun  9 01:31:46 CEST 2014
        - connection header was malformed (patch by Raphael Geissert).

         - implement relative location headers (rfc 7231), with fallback on URI.

      - use the recurse parameter to also limit the number of retries to be
         done, avodiing endless loops with broken servers, as reported
         by Carl Chambers.

Tue Jun 14 09:45:02 UTC 2011 - coolo@novell.com

- updated to 2.12
  - fix a possible 'Can't call method "destroyed"' error (which would
    have been reported by Carl Chambers).
  - the keepalive session cache wouldn't take port and scheme into account
    when reusing connection - potentially causing information leaks
    (reported by Nick Kostirya).
  - bump AnyEvent dependency version (reported by Richard Harris).
  - the keepalive and persistent parameters were actually named
    differently in the code - they now work as documented.
  - fix a bug where callbacks would sometimes never be called when
    the request timeout is near or below the persistent connection
    timeout (testcase by Cindy Wang).
  - destroying the guard would have no effect when a request was
    recursing or being retired.
  - "proxy => undef" now overrides any global proxy when specified.
  - require scheme in urls, also use a stricter match to match urls,
    leading or trailing garbage is no longer tolerated.
  - EXPERIMENTAL: allow '=' in cookie values.
  - do not lowercase cookie names, only parameter names.
  - add missing dependency on common::sense.
  - add a resume download example.
