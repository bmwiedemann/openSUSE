Fri Oct  8 14:52:41 UTC 2021 - Reinhard Max <max@suse.com>

- boo#1190926: PrivateDevices is too strict, we might need to
  access the rtc and ptp devices.

- boo#1187906: Consolidate all references to the helper script.
- bsc#1173760: MD5 is not available from mozilla-nss in FIPS mode,
  but needed for calculating refids from IPv6 addresses as part of
  the NTP protocol (rfc5905). As this is a non-cryptographic use of
  MD5 we can use our own implementation without violating FIPS
  rules: chrony-refid-internal-md5.patch .
