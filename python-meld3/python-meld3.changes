- update to 1.0.2:
  - Released to fix an issue where the universal wheel was tagged on PyPI
    as Py Version "2.7" instead of "py2.py3".
  - Fixed a bug introduced in 1.0.0 where unicode strings could not be used
    as attribute values.  Thanks to Terrence Brannon for reporting the issue
    and supplying the initial patch.
  - A ``setup.cfg`` file has been added with a ``[bdist_wheel]`` section to
    mark this package as a universal wheel.

Tue May 13 12:30:50 UTC 2014 - hpj@urpla.net

- Update to 1.0.0
  - Dropped support for Python 2.3 / 2.4.  Users of those Python versions
    should pin to earlier releases, (e.g., "meld3<1.0.0dev").
  - Added compatibility with Python 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4.  Thanks to Scott
    Maxwell and Tres Seaver for contributing the patches.
  - Installation now requires setuptools.
  - The optional C extension has been removed.  It was only used internally
    by meld3, was not enabled by default, and did not support all meld3
    features.  The pure Python version has very acceptable performance.
  - The license has been changed from ZPL 2.1 to the BSD-derived Repoze
    license, which is the same license used by Supervisor.
  - Profiling scripts that had been used early in meld3 development have
    been removed.
  - The example scripts example.py and melddiff.py have been removed.  See
    README.rst for the same example that was in example.py and the unit tests
    for examples of the ``diffmeld`` function.
  - Support for using meld3 directly from the command line with
    ``python meld3.py <file> <mutator>`` has been removed.

Thu Dec  6 00:41:56 UTC 2012 - alexandre@exatati.com.br

- Update to 0.6.10:
  - Fixed a bug where an exception could be raised when escaping certain
    attribute or cdata values.  This was caused by meld3 trying to use
    _encode_entity from xml.etree without importing it first.  Thanks to
    Jorge Puente Sarrin for contributing the patch.
- Aditional changes from 0.6.9:
  - Fixed a test failure that only occurred on some builds of
    Python 2.7 where parsing an unknown entity could raise
    an expat.error instead of SyntaxError.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov  7 13:23:27 UTC 2012 - saschpe@suse.de

- No need to BUildRequire python-elementree, the elementree xml
  library is part of python now

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan 13 16:46:00 UTC 2012 - alexandre@exatati.com.br

- Update 0.6.8:
  - Added the C extension source (cmeld3.c) to the release package
    by including it in MANIFEST.in. Thanks to Soren Hansen for
    noticing it was missing from prior releases.

    Running setup.py will now halt on error if a compatible version
    of Python is not detected.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May 27 02:00:33 UTC 2011 - alexandre@exatati.com.br

- Update to 0.6.7:
  - Make compatible with Python 2.7 (patch kindly contributed by
    Jonathan Riboux).
- Aditional changes from 0.6.6:
  - Change download location.  This really should be a setuptools
    package so we can upload it to PyPI. No functionality changes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun 21 12:11:47 UTC 2010 - alexandre@exatati.com.br
