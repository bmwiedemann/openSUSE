-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug 29 17:04:17 UTC 2012 - scorot@free.fr

- version 4.2.4
  - Fixed a very unlikely but possible memory-bug in the XML-file
    saving/loading-part
  - Fixed a very unlikely but possible memory-leak in speedit.cpp
  - Fixes for the timestamp-counter on newer platforms
  - Slightly optimized some default window positions after the 1.st
    start ever
  - Made settings-stuff more elegant throughout the code what
    shrinks the executable size too
  - Switched icons to more modern KDE4-style where this seems
    optically feasible and consistent
  - Cosmetic improvements/updates or typo-fixes elsewhere 
- fix build on recent product with patch1
- spec file reformating

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 30 19:12:21 CEST 2009 - tthidney@seznam.cz

- updated to 4.1.0

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 11 09:54:08 CET 2008 - pnemec@suse.cz
- updated to 4.0.0
- The legends-editor is fully featured now. You can add up to nine labels. Each of them can be positioned, coloured, enabled or resized individually
- Raised the maximum number of user-defined functions to 64
- Switched zhu-file format to XML. The new format is not backward compatible, but you still can read old formats down to version 2.8.0 from November 2006
- Added more specific error messages for file loading
- Moved debugging switch to zhu3d.pro and excluded error class from compilation when turned off. This results in faster compile time and a smaller executable
- Changed all examples to the new 4.0.0 format
- Added legend examples
- Slight code optimisations in regards to zhu-conventions
- Note that all labels are scaleable nearly as precise as a PDF whether it is done in pure OpenGL with a bit Qt4. No complicated subclassing, no funky texture tricks, no extra libs. Developers may take a look at the source and wonder how easy it can be
- Fixed a major bug which was introduced in 3.4.8, where you could not reload files after saving
- Versions >=3.4.6 lost the ability to render textures into pictures and to printer. Fixed
- Updated English and German help-files

100,104d99
- updated to 2.9.6
 - A comment with # can appear anywhere in a function input now instead of just at the beginning
 - Added missing hyperbolic area functions (asinh, acosh, ...) to the parsers. The hyperbolic example works now as expected
 - The solver showed a wait cursor, when it was not successfull. Corrected

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan  2 11:13:01 CET 2007 - pnemec@suse.cz

- updated to 2.9.2
  - Added a spreadsheet for user defined items. So you can freely define your own constants and functions as you need it. E.g you can formulate Einsteins law as the function energy(mass)=mass*c^2 now. User defined functions can have an arbitrary amount of parameters and can be nested with other functions or constants. As things can get quite complex now, it is highly recommended to look at the new examples
  - Enabled if-conditions, boolean expressions and recursions for the OpenGL parsers and user defined items
  - Added examples for simple and complex user defined items
  - Added examples for if-conditions and boolean operators
  - Added examples for recursions
  - Added menu "File/New" for a comfortable default starting point
  - Small changes in menu entries/GUI to reflect real meanings better
  - Added/updated Chinese and French html-helpfiles. Special thanks again to Yanqing and Henri Girard for maintaining these translations
  - Updated Spanish GUI/html. Special thanks again to Victor Fernandez for maintaining this translation
  - Some code clean-ups/restructuring/size reduction
  - Adaptions in the Warp-parser for enhanced "Zhu3D-compatibility"
  - Replaced the "Open" icon for a consistent KDE-like look and feel
  - The French html was ugly when shown with internal browser. Fixed
  - Some polishing/corrections in the docs and the examples
- fixed path problem in spec file, created zhu3d.pri patch to fix path

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Dec  8 10:52:12 CET 2006 - pnemec@suse.cz

- updated to 2.9.0
 - Replaced recursive OpenGL-parser with the bytecode-version from Warp. With some additional tuning the average speed gain is between 300%-500%. Especially important for costly isosurfaces on slower machines
 - Raised upper limit for isosurface grid
 - The parser syntax changed slightly. E.g: 2X*SIN(XY) must be written as 2*x*sin(x*y) now
 - To stay compatible added all missing functions to the Warp-parser and introduced the $ sign for constants there
 - New parser functions are: floor(), ceil(), cot(), csc(), sec()
 - Added new functions to recursive parser, which is still in use for solving due to it's precision
 - In parameter mode the Z-grid buttons consequently are disabled now
 - Some code shrink measurements
 - Completely reworked examples for new syntax
 - Loading a zhu-file always starts with a blank viewer window now. This avoids worrying intermixing of old/new views during build up
 - Small changes in menu entries/GUI to reflect real meanings better
 - Improvements/updates for Chinese and French GUI-translation. Special thanks again to Yanqing and Henri Girard for maintaining this translations
 - Enabled the nicer Zhu3D-logo in GUI/menu entries too now
 - The combobox under "Settings/General/Language" did not retranslate it's own language entries immediately. Fixed
 - Clean ups in ./src for readability and unifications

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov 23 00:00:00 CET 2006 Pavel Nemec <pnemec@suse.cz>

- updated to 2.7.4
- Some tuning for OpenGL list handling. Especially complexer Zhu3D files may be shown a lot faster after loading now
- Added function log2() to the parsers
- Some clean ups in translation files and error messages

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov 21 00:00:00 CET 2006 Pavel Nemec <pnemec@suse.cz>
