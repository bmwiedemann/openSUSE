.SH "NOTES"
The system administrator is aware that every modified file below
.I /etc/pam.d/
is on his own obligation. For this: after an update of one of the pam
packages, system upgrade, or system update, the system administrator
may check the pam configuration by comparing the modified files
with files having suffixes
.IR .rpmsave\  or\  .rpmnew
for required supplements in the modified pam configuration files.
