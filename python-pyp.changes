  add a new source with the github repo to get the tests that are not
  in the pypi release. (gh#hauntsaninja/pyp#33)
- Update to 1.1.0:
  * Fix AST construction on Python 3.11
  * Constructed ASTs now have a more convincing end_lineno
  * Test coverage for fallback unparsing, other test improvements
  * Now packaged by flit
- [v1.0.0]
  * Configuration now allows the use of magic variables, effectively
    allowing you to define your own magic variables. See README.md for
    details
  * Explicit printing in used config functions will now disable
    automatic printing
  * Config definitions can now use things defined from wildcard
    imports. Automatic imports now work in config as well
  * Removed s as a magic variable. If you miss it, you can redefine it
    in your config using s = x
  * Implement correct scoping semantics for comprehensions, including
    with assignment expressions
