- Update to version 3.0.1:
  + Minor bug fix release.
- Changes from versioon 3.0.0:
  + New major "turkey-day" release!
  + New DXT compressor.
  + OpenMP support.
  + New mipmap generator, with better support for alpha mipmaps.
  + Support reading/writing DX10 texture arrays.
- Only export %{optflags} into CFLAGS: the Makefile now correctly
  extends CFLAGS with its own values instead of overwriting
  everything.
- No longer call make -e, but use regular make call (as we don't
  need to prefer env variables any longer).

- Updated to version 2.2.1:
  + Bugfix release. Fixes artifacts introduced by the compression
    code in some images.
- Updates from version 2.2.0:
  + Compressed non-power-of-2 texture support.
  + Fix compressed mipmap images with width or height less than 4.
- Export CFLAGS in order to have a fully optimized build. Note:
  as the Makefile does not support extending CFLAGS, we need to add
  the content of the original variable as well, and invoke make -e.
