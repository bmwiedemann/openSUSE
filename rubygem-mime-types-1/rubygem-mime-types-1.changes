Mon Aug 26 05:05:24 UTC 2013 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to version 1.24
 * Code Climate:
   * Working on improving the quality of the mime-types codebase through the use
     of Code Climate. https://codeclimate.com/github/halostatue/mime-types
   * Simplified MIME::Type.from_array to make more assumptions about assignment.
 * Documentation:
   * LeoYoung <mrleoyoung@gmail.com> pointed out that the README.rdoc contained
     examples that could never possibly work because MIME::Types#[] returns (for
     all the versions I have handy) an array, not a single type. I have updated
     README.rdoc to reflect this.
 * Removed Nokogiri as a declared development dependency. It is still required
   if you're going to use the IANA parser functionality, but it is not necessary
   for most development purposes. This has been removed to ensure that Travis CI
   passes on Ruby 1.8.7.
 * New MIME Types:
   * 7zip (application/x-7z-compressed). Fixes a request by kodram.
     https://github.com/halostatue/mime-types/issues/32
   * application/x-www-form-urlencoded. Fixes a request by alexkwolfe.
     https://github.com/halostatue/mime-types/issues/39
   * Various new MIME types from IANA:
     * application/mbms-schedule\+xml from 3GPP and Turcotte.
     * application/provenance\+xml from W3C and Herman.
     * application/session-info from 3GPP and Firmin.
     * application/urc-grpsheet\+xml, application/urc-targetdesc\+xml,
       application/uisocketdesc\+xml from Zimmermann.
     * application/api\+json from Klabnik.
     * application/vnd.etsi.pstn\+xml from Han and Belling.
     * application/vnd.fujixerox.docuworks.container from Tashiro.
     * application/vnd.windows.devicepairing from Dandawate.
     * video/vnd.radgamettools.bink and video/vnd.radgamettools.smacker from
       Andersson.
 * Updated MIME Types:
   * RFC 6960 was adopted (application/ocsp-request and application/ocsp-response).
