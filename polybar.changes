Mon Nov 27 20:28:36 UTC 2023 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 3.7.1:
  Build:
  * Fixed missing header when using libc++ in clang 15 and below
  Changed:
  * internal/tray: The module must use the <tray> tag (this is the default) (#3037)
  Fixed:
  * Modules did not validate that all tags (e.g. <label>) used in
    a format were valid for that format (#3043, #3045)
  * internal/tray: Fixed module-margin and separator being applied
    to completely empty tray module (#3036, #3037)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov  8 12:31:49 UTC 2023 - Mateusz Mielczarek <mateusz.mielczarek2@gmail.com>

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov  6 13:17:17 UTC 2023 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 3.7.0:
  Breaking:
  * custom/script: No longer hides the module if the exec command
    failed and did not change the output from the previous run (#2636).
    Somewhat similar original behaviour can be imitated with format-fail,
    if necessary.  If the exec command produced no output and exited with
    a non-zero exit code the module is no longer completely empty, but
    just has an empty %output% token. If you relied on this behavior
    to hide the module under certain circumstances, make sure the script
    exits with an exit code of zero. (#2857, #2861)
  Build:
  * Respect CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX when installing default config (#2770, #2917)
  * Change default CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX to /usr. Installations with default
    flags will now go into /usr instead of /usr/local (#2917)
  * Bump C++ version to C++17 (#2847)
  Deprecated:
  * custom/text: The content setting and all its properties are deprecated in
    favor of format with the same functionality. (#2676)
  * tray: All tray-related settings in the bar section are deprecated. They
    are replaced by the new tray module (#3002)
  Added:
  * A tray module with type internal/tray for positioning the tray like a module (#2689)
  * internal/temperature: %temperature-k% token displays the temperature in
    degrees Kelvin (#2774, #2784)
  * internal/pulseaudio: reverse-scroll option (#2664)
  * custom/script: Repeat interval for script failure (interval-fail) and
    exec-if (interval-if) (#943, #2606, #2630)
  * custom/ipc:
    + Added support for <label> in format (#2841)
    + Added support for format-i for each defined hook-i (#2775, #2810)
  * custom/text: Loads the format setting, which supports the <label> tag,
    if the deprecated content is not defined (#1331, #2673, #2676)
  * internal/backlight:
    + scroll-interval option (#2696, #2700)
    + poll-interval setting controls how often the module is updated (in case
      it does not happen when the brightness changes) (#2835, #3028)
  * internal/temperature: Added zone-type setting (#2572, #2752)
  * internal/xwindow: %class% and %instance% tokens, which show the contents
    of the WM_CLASS property of the active window (#2830)
  * Added enable-struts option in bar section to enable/disable struts (#2769, #2844)
  * wm-restack:
    + bottom: lowers polybar to the bottom of the window stack (same as the previous
      behavior of generic) (#2961)
    + ewmh: Tries to use the _NET_SUPPORTING_WM_CHECK hint to position the bar (#2961)
  * internal/xworkspaces: group-by-monitor setting to decide whether _NET_DESKTOP_VIEWPORT
    should be used to group workspaces by monitor; (#2603, #2926)
  Changed:
  * custom/script:
    + No longer produces a completely empty module if the exec command failed. It only
      produces an empty module if the script had a zero exit code. (#2857, #2861)
    + Bumped the script polling interval (not related to the interval setting) to
      decrease wakeups. Polybar may take slightly longer to shut down. #2879
  * internal/fs: Use / as a fallback if no mountpoints are specified (#2572, #2705)
  * internal/backlight:
    + Detect backlight if none specified (#2572, #2728)
    + use-actual-brightness now always defaults to true (even for amdgpu backlights) (#2835, 2839)
  * Providing a negative min-width to a token adds right-padding (#2789, #2801)
  * Changed fuzzy match option on i3 and bspwm modules to find longest match instead
    of the first match (#2831, #2829)
  * wm-restack
    + generic: Is now a best effort combination of other restacking strategies. First
      tries ewmh and then the bottom strategy (#2961)
    + bspwm: Will restack above the topmost bspwm root window instead of the root window
      associated with the monitor polybar is on (#3019)
  Fixed:
  * Waiting for double click interval on modules that don't have a double click action (#2663, #2695)
  * renderer:
    + Small gaps when rendering emojis (#2785, #2802)
    + Crash when using pseudo-transparency with certain wallpapers (#2798, #2813)
    + Crash when invalid UTF-8 text is encountered (#2091, #2958)
  * config:
    + Error reporting for deprecated config values (#2724)
    + Also monitor include-files for changes when --reload is set (#675, #2759)
  * internal/xwindow: module does not crash when a tag is not provided in format (#2826, #2833)
  * internal/i3: module errors when i3 has negative gaps (#2888, #2889)
  * internal/backlight: Fix module being one step behind every update (#2835, #3028)
  * wm-restack = bspwm: bar may become unclickable if there are overlapping monitors (#2873, #2961)

Thu Mar 10 15:35:35 UTC 2022 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar  2 08:17:00 UTC 2022 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 3.6.0:
  Breaking:
  * We added the backslash escape character (\) for configuration values. This
    means that the literal backslash character now has special meaning in
    configuration files, therefore if you want to use it in a value as a literal
    backslash, you need to escape it with the backslash escape character. The parser
    logs an error if any unescaped backslashes are found in a value. This affects
    you only if you are using two consecutive backslashes in a config value, which
    will now be interpreted as a single literal backslash. (#2354)
  * We rewrote our formatting tag parser. This shouldn't break anything, if you
    experience any problems, please let us know. The new parser now gives errors for
    certain invalid tags where the old parser would just silently ignore them.
    Adding extra text to the end of a valid tag now produces an error. For example,
    tags like %{T-a}, %{T2abc}, %{rfoo}, and others will now start producing errors.
    This does not affect you unless you are producing your own invalid formatting
    tags (for example in a script).
  * For security reasons, the named pipe at /tmp/polybar_mqueue.<PID> had its
    permission bits changed from 666 to 600 to prevent sending ipc messages to
    polybar processes running under a different user.
  * For details see: https://github.com/polybar/polybar/releases/tag/3.6.0

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 22 07:32:39 UTC 2021 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

    replaced (#2500)
