+    <p>
+      KeePassX is a free/open-source password manager or safe which helps you to
+      manage your passwords in a secure way. You can put all your passwords in one
+      database, which is locked with one master key or a key-disk. So you only have
+      to remember one single master password or insert the key-disk to unlock the
+      whole database. The databases are encrypted using the best and most secure
+      encryption algorithms currently known (AES and Twofish).
