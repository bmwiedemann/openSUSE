%description
airspeed velocity (asv) is a tool for benchmarking Python packages
over their lifetime.

It is designed to benchmark a single project over its lifetime using
a given suite of benchmarks. The results are displayed in an
interactive web frontend that requires only a basic static webserver
to host.
