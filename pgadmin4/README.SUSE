1. Install the postgresql server and configure it.
   If you already have a postgresql instance you can skip this step.

   First, we have to install the postgresql server with:

   sudo zypper in postgresql10-server

   Then we start the server:

   sudo rcpostgresql start

   And then we have to add login credentials for the user postgres with:

   sudo -u postgres psql postgres

   This will open the psql client where you have to type:

   \password postgres

   It will ask for the password and then once again to confirm it. You can exit psql by typing '\q'

   Now we'll make sure postgresql allows users to login by asking for the
   password. Edit the /var/lib/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf file as root and replace
   the "ident" authentication method by "md5", like this:

host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            md5
host    all             all             ::1/128                 md5

   Of course, if users need to log in from other hosts, use the proper network masks.

   Now, let's restart the server so the new configuration is used:

   sudo rcpostgresql restart

2. Start pgAdmin4 ("Management tool for PostgreSQL (pgAdmin 4)") which you can
   find in the Office menu in your desktop. This will open pgadmin4 in your
   default browser and an icon in your system tray which can be used to open
   more windows or shut pgadmin down.

3. In pgAdmin, click on "Add New Server" . Set a name for the server connection,
   go to the "Connection" tab and set the connection information . If you're
   using a postgresql instance in the same host, you can use:
   Hostname: localhost
   Password: the password of the postgres user.

   Click on "Save" to store the new server configuration.

4. The server should appear in the left pane.
