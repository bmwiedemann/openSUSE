Subject: gdb-6.5-sharedlibrary-path.patch

;; Fix TLS symbols resolving for shared libraries with a relative pathname.
;; The testsuite needs `gdb-6.5-tls-of-separate-debuginfo.patch'.
;;=fedoratest: One should recheck if it is really fixed upstream.

If you provided some relative path to the shared library, such as with
	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=.
then gdb would fail to match the shared library name during the TLS lookup.

Dropped the workaround/fix for gdb-6.8.50.20081128 - is it still needed?

The testsuite needs `gdb-6.3-bz146810-solib_absolute_prefix_is_empty.patch'.
The testsuite needs `gdb-6.5-tls-of-separate-debuginfo.patch'.

2006-09-01  Jan Kratochvil  <jan.kratochvil@redhat.com>

	* solib-svr4.c (svr4_fetch_objfile_link_map): Match even absolute
	requested pathnames to the internal loaded relative pathnames.

2007-10-16  Jan Kratochvil  <jan.kratochvil@redhat.com>

	Port to GDB-6.7.

2008-02-27  Jan Kratochvil  <jan.kratochvil@redhat.com>

	Port to gdb-6.7.50.20080227.
