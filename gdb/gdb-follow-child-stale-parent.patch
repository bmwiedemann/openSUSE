;; Fix regression by python on ia64 due to stale current frame.
;;=push+jan

Problem occurs with python and its get_current_arch () as it selects
selected_frame and current_frame while still inferior_ptid is valid for the
original parent.  But since this place it is already attached and later
unwinders try to access it, breaking:
