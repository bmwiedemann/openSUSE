%description
waypipe is a proxy for Wayland clients. It forwards Wayland messages
and serializes changes to shared memory buffers over a single socket.
This makes application forwarding similar to `ssh -X` feasible.

Waypipe needs to be run on both ends of a socket connection. It
emulates shared files between the different systems on each end of
the connection, using twin file copies to quickly identify file
changes.

It supports both shared-memory and DMABUFs. Performance on a local
network is kind of acceptable for terminals and relatively static
applications, but games are often unplayable due to FPS drop from the
delay needed to send a screenful of data over the network.
