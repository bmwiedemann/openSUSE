%description -n %{name}%{sover}
A library for video editing, composition, animation, and playback,
which focuses on The library is written in C++ and includes full
bindings for Python and Ruby. It features:

* Multi-layer compositing
* Video and audio effects (chroma key, color adjustment,
  grayscale, etc.)
* Animation curves (BÃ©zier, linear, constant)
* Time mapping (curve-based slow-down, speed-up, reverse)
* Audio mixing & resampling (curve-based)
* Audio plug-ins (VST & AU)
* Telecine and Inverse Telecine (film to TV, TV to film)
* Frame rate conversions
* Multi-processor support
* Uses ffmpeg for format and codec support

This package contains the shared library.
