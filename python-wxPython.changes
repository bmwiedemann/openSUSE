Mon Dec  5 13:07:46 UTC 2022 - Daniel Garcia <daniel.garcia@suse.com>

- Add python-pytest-forked as test dependency
  * The pytest parameter --forked is provided by python-pytest-forked
    which is no longer a transitive build requirement of
    python-pytest-xdist
  * gh#pytest-dev/pytest-xdist#468, gh#pytest-dev/pytest-xdist#821

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Wed Jan  5 11:12:25 UTC 2022 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Reduce complexity by not rewriting subpackages at all.
  Multibuild flavors now must be a superset of all existing
  python3 flavors.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan  4 22:28:51 UTC 2022 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- The difference of a single whitespace character is significant

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan  4 13:58:38 UTC 2022 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Appease factory-auto bot about package src name

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan  4 10:18:08 UTC 2022 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Add additional patches fixing the situation with Python 3.10
  compatibility:
  - 2039-bunch-py310-fixes.patch (from gh#wxWidgets/Phoenix#2039)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec 29 10:23:20 UTC 2021 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Split out the TW python3 flavors into multibuild using the
  python_subpackage_only mechanism: Multiple python3 flavors
  sequentially require too much space and time in one build.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jun 12 16:32:57 UTC 2021 - Antoine Belvire <antoine.belvire@opensuse.org>

- Bump required wxWidgets version to 3.1.5.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun 11 01:41:18 UTC 2021 - Stanislav Brabec <sbrabec@suse.com>

- Increase disk space constraint to 15G.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun  8 17:52:01 UTC 2021 - Antoine Belvire <antoine.belvire@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 4.1.1:
  * wxWidgets is now validating the flags passed when adding items
    to a sizer, to ensure that they are the correct flags for the
    type of the sizer. If the given flags do not make sense, for
    example using horizontal alignment flags in a horizontal box
    sizer, then a wxAssertionError error is raised.
  * Fixed missing binder for wxEVT_STC_AUTOCOMP_SELECTION_CHANGE.
    (PR#1613).
  * DataViewModel.HasValue can be overridden and will inform the
    DataViewCtrl whether or not an item and column has data. If
    HasValue returns False, then GetValue for that item/col will
    not be called. This allows a distinction between a truly empty
    cell, and one that has a value even if it is an empty string.
    (PR#1600)
  * Added flag that allows blocking of item dragging in the
    UltimateListControl class. (PR#1620)
  * Add the column index to notification events in
    UltimateListControl (PR#1630).
  * Added orientation parameter to UltimateListControl.GetScrollPos.
    (PR#1632)
  * wx.lib.agw.aui.AuiNotebook RemovePage() now hides the removed
    page, so it needs to be shown again if it is reused in another
    place. (PR#1668)
  * Fixed issue that could modify bytes objects under Python.
    (PR#1680)
  * Added wx.lib.agw.aui.EVT_AUI_PANE_CLOSE event which is sent when
    a AUI (the agw version) Pane has been closed (after it has been
    closed, not when it is about to be closed, which is when
    EVT_AUI_PANE_CLOSE is sent.) (PR#1628)
  * Exposed the wx.DC methods GetGraphicsContext and
    SetGraphicsContext. Depending on the platform and the type of
    the DC, there may be a wx.GraphicsContext used for the
    implementation of the DC. If so, the GetGraphicsContext method
    enables access to it. Be sure to check that the return value is
    not None before trying to use it.
  * Simplified the implementation of the wx.App.InitLocale method.
    See the MigrationGuide for more information.
  * Added wx.lib.agw.aui.AUI_DOCKART_HINT_WINDOW_BORDER_COLOUR
    constant so the hint window border color can be themed as well.
  * The wx.lib.mixins.listCtrl.CheckListCtrlMixin is now obsolete
    because wx.ListCtrl has new functionality which does pretty much
    the same thing. In fact there is some overlap in method names
    which may trip up some use cases. It is advised to drop the use
    of CheckListCtrlMixin and just use the wx.ListBox functionality.
    You will need to call EnableCheckBoxes to turn it on, and you
    may need to change some event handlers or overloaded methods.
  * wx.html2.WebView is now able to use Microsoft's Edge browser
    component as its backend renderer. This should improve the
    capabilities of the WebView widget on Windows, and be more
    consistent with the WebViews on the other platforms, compared to
    the original IE 11 backend. Using this backed requires that a
    new-ish version of the Edge browser is installed on the end
    user's computer.
  * Added the wx.Image.ConvertToRegion method. This lets you create
    a wx.Region from an image and a specified color or the mask if
    the image has one. This was done to workaround a bug in wxMac,
    but it seems worthwhile enough to keep it around even after the
    bug was fixed.
  * Added the missing context manager methods for wx.LogNull.
    (PR#1842)
  * Refactored ScrolledThumbnail out of agw.ThumbnailCtrl so as to
    be usable outside of ThumbnailCtrl.
- Add wxPython-4.1.1-fix-overrides.patch: Fix build with wxWidgets
  3.1.5 (gh#wxWidgets/Phoenix#1909).
- Remove patches merged upstream:
  * 0001-Fix-conversion-of-variant-list-members.patch
  * 0001-Fix-wxUIActionSimulator-Text-parameter-documentation.patch
  * 0003-Use-explicit-wxString-c_str-conversion-for-sipFindTy.patch
- Increase required disk space to 15GB: Fix build failures due to
  disk space exhaustion.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 31 01:32:34 UTC 2021 - Steve Kowalik <steven.kowalik@suse.com>

- Don't build using Python 3.6 for test package, when that gets reenabled.
- Since build.py install helpfully installs every built shared object
  under site-package directories, remove those not for that version of
  Python. (bsc#1182822)
- Correct python uninstall alternatives to list all of them, not just one.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 30 17:48:02 UTC 2020 - Stefan Brüns <stefan.bruens@rwth-aachen.de>

- Use system wxWidgets (wxGTK3) instead of bundling
- Cleanup test dependencies and check section (tests still disabled
  due to too many failures)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul  1 12:55:23 UTC 2020 - Stefan Brüns <stefan.bruens@rwth-aachen.de>

- Wrap all relevant build dependencies when building with system
  wxWidgets library.
- Add patches to allow building with STL variant of wxGTK:
  * 0001-Fix-conversion-of-variant-list-members.patch
  * use_stl_build.patch
  * 0001-Fix-wxUIActionSimulator-Text-parameter-documentation.patch
  * 0003-Use-explicit-wxString-c_str-conversion-for-sipFindTy.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May 29 22:21:35 UTC 2020 - Stefan Brüns <stefan.bruens@rwth-aachen.de>

- Add explicit libXtst build dependency, required for Leap 15.1
  (already implicit on Leap 15.2 and TW).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr 28 09:01:51 UTC 2020 - Guillaume GARDET <guillaume.gardet@opensuse.org>

- Update to 4.1.0:
  * Add a sample for wx.Font.AddPrivateFont to the demo.
  * Added wrappers for the OSXEnableAutomaticQuoteSubstitution, 
    OSXEnableAutomaticDashSubstitution, and OSXDisableAllSmartSubstitutions
    methods in wx.TextCtrl. Also added OSXEnableAutomaticTabbing in wx.App.
  * Added wx.ColourDialogEvent, wx.DCTextBgColourChanger, wx.DCTextBgModeChanger,
    wx.grid.GridCellDateRenderer, wx.grid.GridCellDateEditor, wx.SystemAppearance, etc.
  * Many of the deprecated items in wxWidgets and wxPython are being or have 
    been removed. Be sure to test your code in a recent 4.0.x release with 
    warnings enabled so you can see which class, method or function calls 
    you need to change.
  * Bug fixes in wx.lib.calendar: key navigation across month boundaries is 
    now possible; key navigation now sets the date and fires the EVT_CALENDAR event;
    setter APIs now set the date correctly #1230.
  * Switch to using a wx.Overlay in the Widget Inspection Tool to highlight 
    widgets when running on a GTK3 port.
  * Fixed issue in wx.lib.agw.customtreectrl where the label editor could 
    remain stuck forever #1235.
  * Grafted on a EnableSystemTheme method to the classes which support it.
    This can be used to disable the default system theme on Windows for native
    widgets like wx.ListCtrl, wx.TreeCtrl and wx.dataview.DataViewCtrl. 
    It has no effect on the other platforms.
  * The wx.WS_EX_VALIDATE_RECURSIVELY extended style flag is obsolete, 
    as it is now the default (and only) behavior. The style flag has been added 
    back into wxPython for compatibility, but with a zero value. You can just 
    stop using it in your code with no change in behavior. #1278
  * Fix a sometimes crash when using a wx.Overlay by letting the wx.DCOverlay 
    hold a reference to the DC, to ensure that the DCOverlay is destroyed first. PR#1301
  * Replaced the Vagrant VMs used for building wxPython for various Linux distros 
    with Docker images.
  * Add some missing methods in wx.adv.BitmapComboBox #1307
  * Added the wx.svg package which contains code for parsing SVG 
    (Scalable Vector Graphics) files, and also code for integrating with 
    wxPython. It can rasterize the SVG to a wx.Bitmap of any size with no 
    loss of quality, and it can also render the SVG directly to a 
    wx.GraphicsContext using the GC's drawing primitives. PR#1323
  * Ported the embedding sample from Classic, which shows how to use wxPython
    from a C++ wxWidgets application that embeds Python. PR#1353
  * Fixed wx.GetApp() to use wxWidgets' global wxApp instance instead of 
    maintaining its own pointer. This way, if the wxApp is created by C++ 
    code wxPython will still be able to get access to it. #1126
  * Added wrappers for the wx.ActivityIndicator class.
  * Added wrappers for the wx.CollapsibleHeaderCtrl class.
  * Fixed issues in PlotCanvas around displaying and using scrollbars. #1428
  * Added wx.msw.CHMHelpController, and also a wx.HelpController factory function
    that creates an instance of the best Help Controller for the platform. #1536
  * Added wx.adv.GenericAnimationCtrl so the generic version of the animation 
    classes can be used even on the platforms that have a native version. 
    Note that due to internal changes to support both types of animations, 
    some API changes in how the Animation objects are created. See the 
    AnimationCtrl.py sample in the demo for the various usage patterns #1579
  * Added wrappers for the wx.grid.GridBlockCoords, wx.grid.GridBlocks, and 
    wx.grid.GridBlockDiffResult classes, as well as associated new methods 
    in the wx.grid.Grid class. These provide a new way to interact with blocks 
    of selected cells, including an iterator interface in wx.grid.GridBlocks
    which should be a more efficient (time and memory) way to process large 
    groups of selections.
- Disable Python2

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar  2 12:41:31 UTC 2020 - Tomáš Chvátal <tchvatal@suse.com>

- Update to 4.0.7.post2:
  * Bugfix to switch to AVFoundation instead of QTKit
- Fix building with new glut (pc file changed)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov 12 04:15:41 UTC 2019 - Steve Kowalik <steven.kowalik@suse.com>

- Update to 4.0.7.post1
  * This post-release just fixes a problem with the numpy dependency constraint
    for Python 2.7. (#1415)
  * Bug fixes in wx.lib.calendar: key navigation across month boundaries is
    now possible; key navigation now sets the date and fires the EVT_CALENDAR
    event; setter APIs now set the date correctly (#1230).
  * Switch to using a wx.Overlay in the Widget Inspection Tool to highlight
    widgets when running on a GTK3 port.
  * Fixed issue in wx.lib.agw.customtreectrl where label editor could remain
    stuck forever (#1235).
  * Fix a sometimes crash when using a wx.Overlay by letting the wx.DCOverlay
    hold a reference to the DC, to ensure that the DCOverlay is destroyed
    first. (PR#1301)
  * Ported the embedding sample from Classic, which shows how to use wxPython
    from a C++ wxWidgets application that embeds Python. (PR #1353)
  * Fixed wx.GetApp() to use wxWidgets' global wxApp instance instead of
    maintaining its own pointer. This way, if the wxApp is created by C++ code
    wxPython will still be able to get access to it. (#1126)
  * Several other PRs have been backported from the master branch (which will
    become wxPython 4.1.0), the full list can be seen here:
    https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/pull/1357
  * Fixed a probably rare, but fatal bug on OSX when calling certain overloaded
    virtual methods with implementations in Python.
  * Fixed char pointers in generated stub code to have a valid pointer value.
  * Reverted the change that loads up install_requires from the contents of
    requirements.txt. Split the requirements.txt file into one for install and
    one for development.
  * Added missing HtmlWindow.ScrollToAnchor method, and also a couple methods
    in HtmlCell too. (#1141)
  * Added missing setters for the wheel-related properties in wx.MouseEvent.
    (#1140)
  * Updated wxWidgets commit reference, bringing fixes for #1140, #1086 and
    #1147.
  * Fix the use of the output parameter in HtmlWindow.OnOpeningURL the same
    way it was fixed in HtmlWindowInterface.OnHTMLOpeningURL. (#1068)
  * Fixed a crashing bug when using a member of a transient wx.VisualAttributes
    object. Also set the attributes to be read-only to simplify the fix.
    (#1198).
  * Updated the sip being used in wxPython builds to version 4.19.16.
  * Added helper functions to check results of wxWidgets configure during the
    build of wxPython. Currently used to determine if the wx webview, glcanvas,
    and media libraries should be added to the link command. (#1138)
  * Fixed scrollbar issue with ListCtrlAutoWidthMixin (#1215)
  * Fixed file access in the wx.py and wx.tools.pywxrc packages to be Python 2
    and 3 compatible. (#1193, #1156)
  * Fixes for building with Python 3.8 on Linux. (#1227)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb  7 18:42:42 UTC 2019 - Todd R <toddrme2178@gmail.com>

- Update to 4.0.4
  * Fixed an issue where wx.lib.intctrl would erroneously attempt to use long
    on Python3. (#898)
  * Include the MSVC runtime DLLs for Python 3.7 builds too.
  * Clear LIBPATH_PYEXT and LIB_PYEXT for linux builds too. (#904)
  * Added a dependency on the Pillow package since it's used in some wx.lib.agw
    modules. (PR #908)
  * Add flag to hide page in wx.lib.agw.aui.notebook. (#895)
  * Switch wx.lib.plot to issue deprecation warnings with PlotPendingDeprecation
    so it doesn't have to enable all warnings to get them to be shown by default.
    (#902)
  * Added a Python 3.7 builder on Fedora 28. (#925)
  * Fix the object ownership transfer for wx.Menu.Insert() (#931)
  * Added wx.Treebook.GetTreeCtrl, wx.Listbook.GetListView and
    wx.Choicebook.GetChoiceCtrl. (#918)
  * Removed the wx.BookCtrlBase.RemovePage workaround as it was causing problems
    and doesn't seem to be necessary any more. The existing wxWidgets assertions
    are catching the out of range error just fine, however if wxWidgets was built
    without the debug helpers turned on then it could still cause a crash. (#888)
  * Reverted the changes which removed the content of the wx.lib.pubsub package
    and encouraged users to switch to the real PyPubSub package instead. Removing
    it caused more issues than were expected so it has been restored and the code
    updated to PyPubSub v3.3.0. Version 4.0.0 is available upstream, but it is not
    compatible with Python 2.7. Now, wx.lib.pubsub is actually deprecated instead
    of just trying to pass control over to the upstream PyPubSub library. (#932)
  * Improve calltip stability in pyshell. (#941)
  * Fix TypeError in wx.lib.throbber. (#924)
  * Fix missing parameter tool_id in
    wx.lib.agw.ribbon.toolbar.RibbonToolBar.AddToggleTool. (#947)
  * Add a step to wx.Config.ReadInt to attempt converting from long to int
    under python2. (#384)
  * Add virtual behavior for wx.RichTextCtrl and wx.TextCtrl's Copy/Cut/Paste methods
    and their Can* counterparts. (#954)
  * Fix IO type in wx.lib.agw.thumbnailctrl  (#959)
  * Fix type error that would occur using pycolourchooser. (#957)
  * Optimize line drawing in HyperTreeList. (#973)
  * Add wrapper for wx.StaticBox.GetBordersForSizer and use it in the demo to do
    platform-specific layout of the items in the StaticBox. (#974)
  * Update wx.Point, wx.RealPoint, and wx.Size to use floating
    point arithmetic when conducting scalar multiplication (#971)
  * Fix load/save bugs in PySlices (PR#978)
  * Replace deprecated PIL.Image.tostring (PR#1005)
  * Fix rendering and mouse sensitivity in UltimateListCtrl when adding HyperText
    items. (#1010)
  * Added a parameter to lib.agw.CustomTreeCtrl.SetItemWindow(), to allow
    positioning the Window (a small image) on the left of text in a
    CustomTreeItem. (#PR886).
  * Declared DeleteAllPages in the notebook subclasses, so the proper C++
    implementation will be called. (#972)
  * Removed wx.lib.floatbar, which has been deprecated forever and probably
    hasn't been working in nearly as long. (#976)
  * Updated SIP to version 4.19.13.
  * Fix an issue in wx.lib.agw.aui.AuiManager where the orientation of
    an AuiToolBar would not be updated when calling LoadPerspective. (#917)
  * Fixed a bug in wx.FileSystemHandler.OpenFile where the object ownership was
    not being transferred correctly, causing a crash after a premature object
    deletion. (#926)
  * Fixed wx.ListCtrl.Append when wx.LC_SORT style is used, so appending items out
    of order does not lose the data for the remaining columns. (#906)
  * Add wx.Accessible, it's Windows-only, will raise a NotImplementedError
    exception on the other platforms. (#958)
  * Added the ability to generate stub classes for use when optional wxWidgets
    features are not part of the build. So far, stubs are available for
    wx.Accessible, wx.FileSystemWatcher, wx.glcanvas, wx.media and wx.html2.
  * Moved the wxpy_api.h file into the wx package at wx/include/wxPython so it
    will be included in the wheel file. (#961)
  * Fixed how string data is added to a virtual file-like object in
    wx.MemoryFSHandler. All strings are now added to the file as utf-8 encoded data,
    in both Python2 and Python3, and will be read from the virtual file the same
    way. If you need to use some other encoding for some reason you can first
    convert the text to a bytesarray or other buffer protocol compatible object and
    then create the virtual file from that data. (#969)
  * Performance update for wx.lib.agw.customtreectrl (#1049)
  * Ensure that colours set in wx.lib.agw.customtreectrl.TreeItemAttr are
    instances of wx.Colour. (#1032)
  * Fix drawing of ticks in wx.lib.agw.speedmeter when there are negative bounds
    values. (#1013)
  * wxWidgets for Mac includes the wxJoystick class now, also update the demo.
    (#997)
  * Fix wx.html.HtmlPrintout to not be seen as an abstract class, so it can be
    instantiated. (#1060)
  * Fix wx.aui.AuiNotbook.SetArtProvider to properly transfer ownership of the art
    object from Python to C++. This possible double-deletion and related crashing
    problems. (#1061)
  * Fixed the wrappers for wx.html.HtmlWindow.OnOpeningURL to properly handle the
    redirect output parameter. (#1068) This is a backwards-incompatible change,
    please see the Migration Guide for details.
  * TabNavigatorWindow works similarly to other programs now. It's resizable and
    draggable so if user has tons of files with long names, it isn't an irritation
    anymore plastered right in the middle of the screen and can't be worked with
    easily and ESC now cancels the popup with a proper returnId. (#1096)
  * Added missing methods in wx.ListBox, SetItemForegroundColour,
    SetItemBackgroundColour and SetItemFont. (#1095)
  * Backported a fix in wxWidgets that avoids crashing in hhctrl.ocx when using
    context sensitive help in 64-bit builds on Windows. (#1104)
- Update to 4.0.3
  * Fixed a linking problem on macOS. The new waf added an explicit link to the
    Python shared library which meant that it would try to load it at runtime,
    even if a different Python (such as Anaconda, EDM or Homebrew) was used to
    import wxPython. This, of course, caused runtime errors. (#892)
  * Sort pages by dock_pos when added to automatic (agw.aui) notebook. (#882)
  * Fix a bug in py.introspect.getTokens. (#889)
  * Added Vagrant configuration for Fedora-28. Removed Fedora-23 (#884)
  * Added wrappers for the wx.WindowIDRef class and added the wx.NewIdRef
    function. These will make it possible to create reserved Window IDs using the
    same mechanism which is used when passing wx.ID_ANY to a widget constructor.
    The object returned by wx.NewIdRef will automatically convert to an int when
    passing it to a window constructor, and can also be used as the source in a
    Bind(). (#896)
  * Fixed issue when sys.prefix is not unicode (Python2) and when its contents 
    are not translatable to utf-8.
- Update to 4.0.2
  * Fixed wx.html2.EVT_WEBVIEW_NAVIGATING event not being sent on some versions
    of Linux. (#741)
  * wx.Sizers can now be used as an iterator to iterate over the items within
    the sizer. (#738)
  * Fix Python3 division in ThumbnailCtrl. (#746)
  * Fix leaking image list in CheckListCtrlMixin (#752)
  * All items marked as deprecated in the wxWidgets interface (documentation)
    files will now throw a DeprecationWarning when used from wxPython. Many of
    these items are disappearing in 4.1 so it's important to ensure they are
    deprecated at runtime too instead of just in the docs. (#749)
  * Ensure that the attribute list given to the GLCanvas constructor is
    zero-terminated like it was in Classic. (#770)
  * Updated to the wxWidgets 3.0.4 release version.
  * Added the wxWidgets version number to the tail end of the string returned by
    wx.version().
  * Bind EVT_WINDOW_DESTROY event only to the tree windows in CustomTreeCtrl,
    since otherwise it would be caught when child windows are destroyed too,
    which causes problems in this case. (#778)
  * Fixed a problem where wx.TreeCtrl.OnCompareItems was not being called in
    derived classes on Windows. This was due to an optimization that wasn't
    compatible with how the classes are wrapped. (#774)
  * Added wrappers for wx.ClassInfo and exposed wx.Object.GetClassInfo. This
    class is part of wxWidgets' internal type information system and although
    it is not very useful for Python applications it is useful for debugging
    some internal wxPython issues.
  * Removed the wx.lib.pubsub package, and replaced it with code that imports
    the standalone PyPubSub in order remain compatible with older code that
    still uses wx.lib.pubsub. (#782, #792)
  * Fixed bug in wx.lib.intctrl (#790)
  * Fixed subclassing of wx.TextCompleter and wx.TextCompleterSimple (#827)
  * Fixes for Python3 compatibility in PyCrust. (#823)
  * Fix wxGet to be able to use pip v10. (#817)
  * Change winid parameter in wx.ScrolledWindow to id, for consistency. (#816)
  * Ensure that the page exists in book controls GetPage and RemovePage methods.
    At least one of the wx ports do not do this. (#830)
  * Added missing wx.NumberEntryDialog
  * Change wx.TextCompleterSimple.GetCompletions to send the list of strings
    as a return value, rather than a parameter that gets filled. (#836)
  * Enabled the wx.GraphicsContext.Create(metaFileDC) wrapper (#811)
  * Metafile support is also available on OSX, so wx.msw.Metafile and
    wx.msw.MetafileDC have been moved to the core wx module. So they can now be
    accessed as wx.Metafile and wx.MetafileDC.
  * Updated the waf tool used by the build to version 2.0.7. This fixes problems
    with building for Python 3.7.
  * Fixed alignment in buttons on MSW which have had foreground or background
    colors set. (#815)
  * Fix for unexpected assertion inside wx.aui.AuiMDIChildFrame.Close.
  * Fix a bug in setting AuiDockingGuide size. (#727)
  * Remove unnecessary AUI notebook updating, and use wx.BufferedDC in Repaint()
    to mitigate flicker. (wx.lib.agw.aui). (#851, #686)
  * Fixed crashing bug when using client data with items in
    wx.dataview.DataViewTreeCtrl. (#856)
  * Detach wx.Control in AuiToolbar from current sizer before attach to a new
    one. (#843)
  * Fixed a problem in wx.lib.mixins.listctrl.TextEditMixin where the height of
    the editor widget could be set to zero. (See discussion in #849)
  * Fix a bug in calculating whether a tool fits into the AuiToolBar. (#863)
  * Override SetForegroundColour and SetBackgroundColour in MaskedEditMixin (#808)
  * Add an explicit wx.GraphicsContext.Create overload for wx.AutoBufferedPaintDC. (#783)
  * Return original AGW window style in AuiToolBar.GetAGWWindowStyleFlag. (#870)
  * Fix a bug in group management on wx.lib.masked.numctrl; the previous code used
    truediv ('/') to calculate _groupSpace, but in python 3.x this leads to a float
    result, instead of an integer as was expected. Using floordiv ('//') instead
    to solve the problem. (#865)
  * Hide the window when the tool does not fit into AuiToolBar. (#872)
  * Fixed the virtual dispatch code for the PGEditor.GetValueFromControl method
    to properly pass the parameters to the Python implementation, and also fixed
    how the return value is handled. (#742)
  * Fixed all implementations of the PGProperty.StringToValue and IntToValue
    methods to treat the value parameter as a return value. (#742)
  * Add missing wx.adv.EVT_CALENDAR_WEEK_CLICKED (#875)
  * Fixed the stock labels to conform to Windows design guidelines. (#787)
  * Always reset floating size and style when floating a toolbar in agw.aui. (#880)
