Subject: themes for inclusion in SuSE. ;P


well... umm... ya!
let me figure em out again...

ok, here are the ones I'm sure are ok:
Anger  <- me
Circuits    <-- circuit image that went into the bg, I'm not sure... I'm 
almost positive it's free... I've seen it in other themes.
Cosmic   <- isabella
CosmicDream   <- isabella
Dark
FearTech  <- me
FreakE
Generic
InDreams   <- isabella
Intrigue   <- isabella
LeetWM
Lichen   <-- started from a propaganda tile, says in the readme.
Linux
Midnight   <- isabella
OpenStepBeta
Star19  <- my gf.
Vivaldi   <- isabella
WO  <-- totally from scratch.
YesterdayIdied  <- me

I've put next to them who it is in the picture, so you know that I have 
permission. ;) (isabella gave me permission to use her images in my themes 
as long as I put a link to her site in the readme's that accompany the 
theme.) the rest are images I made from scratch (aside from the fonts maybe)

these I'm not sure about:
Mozilla
ArenaWall
Quake

I don't know how ID would feel about em. :/ they seem to be Open Source 
friendly... and Mozilla as well. :P

anyways. thanks. :)
I hope that's enough detail for you. I tried to pick the themes that I am 
either totally positive are OK, or are as close as I think I can get.
you can find all these in http://wm.current.nu/themes/my-themes/
