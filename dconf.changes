- Update to version 0.31.2:
  + Bin:
    - Rewrite dconf utility in C. Updates are no longer conditional
      on the mtime of the database directory and files. Help
      information is shown on erroneous usage, but not otherwise.
    - Add a new database directory argument for the update command.
  + Build: Make dconf client vapi file installation optional, and
    thus the Vala dependency optional (still built by default). 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan  8 13:22:01 UTC 2019 - bjorn.lie@gmail.com

- Update to version 0.31.1:

  + Engine: Fix memory leak when subscribing to a path.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep  7 20:11:22 UTC 2018 - bjorn.lie@gmail.com

- Update to version 0.30.0:
  + No changes, stable bump only.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug 28 19:48:33 UTC 2018 - bjorn.lie@gmail.com

- Update to version 0.29.2:
  + Service: When corrupt GVDB files are found, they are now
    transparently backed up and replaced with an empty database.
  + Replace all hard-coded /etc path with sysconfdir. This is
    useful for JHBuild environments and systems that don't want to
    use /etc/dconf.
  + Engine: Change overflow thresholds in subscription counts from
    GMAXUINT32 to GMAXUINT.
  + Change meson flag used to build Gtk-Doc from enable-gtk-doc to
    gtk_doc.
  + Declare libdconf_service as a dependency to fix the build in
    massively parallelised environments.
- Change options passed to meson following upstreams changes, now
  passing bash_completion=true, man=true and gtk_doc=true.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug 16 19:01:42 UTC 2018 - bjorn.lie@gmail.com

- Update to version 0.29.1:
  + Engine: track in progress watch handles to avoid spurious
    changed signals for the root path. Subscription requests are no
    longer sent if the engine is already subscribed to the given
    path. In the case that some value changes while a subscription
    request is in progress, a changed signal is only sent for the
    path being subscribed to instead of the root path.
  + Engine: fix deadlock which occured when using the engine from
    libsoup within flatpak by extending the existing workaround for
    Glib issue. GSocket and various other GObject types are now
    also initialised in the main thread.
  + Add transfer annotations to the GTK-Doc strings for functions
    in the dconf_changeset_* and dconf_client_* namespaces.
  + Update GVDB subtree from GVDB master, containing mostly
    documentation improvements.
  + dconf-update.vala: correct error message grammar.
  + Various meson related improvements.
  + Add GitLab CI.

  + No visible changes.
- Drop:
  + intltool BuildRequires: there are no translations to be
    handled.
  + update-desktop-files BuildRequires: there is no desktop file to
    be handled.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

  + Port to meson build system.
- Add meson BuildRequires and switch autotools macros configure,
  make and makeinstall to meson, meson_build and meson_install
  following upstream switch to Meson build system.
- Drop the BUILD_FROM_VCS checks, and build gtk-doc
  unconditionally: this is needed since the port to meson.
- Pass enable-man=true option to meson: man files are no longer
  built unless this is explicitly specified.
- Drop the find command for finding and deleting libtool archives:
  these are no longer built since the port to meson build system.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct  3 20:33:13 UTC 2017 - luc14n0@linuxmail.org

- Update to version 0.26.1:
  + Work around a deadlock in GObject type initialization

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar  2 14:36:50 UTC 2017 - fezhang@suse.com

- Update 0001-gvdb-Restore-permissions-on-changed-files.patch:
  'dconf update' should set permissions to 0644 on restored missing
  db files, despite of the umask setting (bsc#1025721, bsc#971074,
  bgo#758066).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug 19 18:10:24 UTC 2016 - fezhang@suse.com

- Add 0001-gvdb-Restore-permissions-on-changed-files.patch:
  'dconf update' writes new contents into temporary file and
  renames it to the original one, resulting permission
  inconsistencies if umask has been changed before that. The patch
  restores the changed permissions (bsc#971074, bgo#758066).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr 13 09:51:11 UTC 2016 - fezhang@suse.com

- Update to GNOME 3.20  Fate#318572
- Drop dconf-use-g_settings_get_default_value.patch (bnc#873225):
  patch applied to dconf-editor.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 23 14:30:49 UTC 2016 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 0.26.0:
  + No changes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec 23 13:56:49 UTC 2015 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 0.25.1:
  + The libdbus-1 backend has been removed. Dconf now always uses
    GDBus.
  + Support has been added for system administration frameworks to
    set up the dconf profile via a file placed in the
    XDG_RUNTIME_DIR or in /run/dconf/. In the case of the file in
    /run/dconf/, it is not possible to modify the proile, even via
    the DCONF_PROFILE environment variable, which makes it slightly
    more difficult to evade lockdown.
  + Directory resets are now implemented properly in DConfChangeset
    which means that reading a subkey through a changeset that
    contains a reset for a parent directory of that key will return
    TRUE with a NULL value.
  + A new API dconf_client_read_full() has been added which allows
    reading the user value, the default value, or querying what the
    effective value would be if a changeset were to be applied.
  + A new API has been added for listing the locks that are in
    effect: dconf_client_list_locks().
  + DConfClient has a new "writability-changed" signal.
  + Support for reading default values and listing locks have been
    added to the dconf commandline tool.
  + Support for g_autoptr() has been added for DConfClient and
    DConfChangeset.
  + The handling of reading of default values via GSettings has
    been made more efficient. More major changes to the GSettings
    backend are expected in the near future.
- Drop pkgconfig(dbus-1) BuildRequires: this backend has been
  dropped.
- Drop libdconf-dbus-1-0 subpackage and obsolete it by libdconf1
  package to ensure proper upgrade mechanism.
- Drop libdconf-dbus-devel subpackage and obsolete it by the
  main devel package.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 23 17:11:47 UTC 2015 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 0.24.0:
  + Stable release, no changes since 0.23.2.

    split).
  + Fix whitespace issues in 'dconf --help'.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar  3 00:34:09 UTC 2015 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 0.23.1:
  + dconf-editor is now in a separate package.
  + portability improvements.
- Drop dconf-editor subpackages and references to it: it's now
  maintained in its own package (version 3.15.91).
- Drop pkgconfig(gtk+-3.0) and pkgconfig(libxml-2.0) BuildRequires:
  dconf-editor dependencies.
- Drop dconf-use-g_settings_get_default_value.patch: patch applied
  to dconf-editor.
- Drop lang-package: it provided languages for dconf-editor
  (despite the gettext domain being 'dconf').

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb  2 13:53:58 UTC 2015 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Move ca.desrt.dconf-editor.appdata.xml to dconf-editor
  subpackage: the appdata.xml file is supposed to be in the same
  package as the .desktop file (boo#915692).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Oct  5 10:20:55 UTC 2014 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Move .desktopfile from X-GNOME-SystemSettings to
  X-GNOME-PersonalSettings, since the only values one can change is
  for active user. Having it under System gives the impression that
  changes are systemwide.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Sep 20 08:25:01 UTC 2014 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 0.22.0:
  + Fix handling of floating point keys in editor.

    advantage of D-Bus activation.
  + Prevent the service from being released more than once if we
    receive multiple signals.
  + Updated translations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug  5 20:04:06 UTC 2014 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update dconf-use-g_settings_get_default_value.patch from
  bgo#668234#c5: Silence "Unknown child tag in <key>, <default>".

Fri Jun 13 09:55:39 UTC 2014 - fezhang@suse.com

- Add category X-GNOME-SystemSettings to dconf-editor.desktop so
  that gnome-control-center can recongnize and show it
  (bnc#866235).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun  3 18:19:03 UTC 2014 - mgorse@suse.com

  + Fix 'make clean' on FreeBSD.
  + editor: provide appdata.
  + Updated translations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 13 22:29:21 UTC 2014 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 0.19.3:
  + Quite a lot of test coverage improvements.
  + Add a proper DCONF_ERROR error domain.
  + Suppress GLib deprecation warnings during build.
  + Engine:
    - Issue warnings about missing files only once per source.
    - Grok the WritabilityNotify signal from D-Bus.
    - Assorted fixes for issues found during testing.
  + gsettings: handle writability changes correctly.
  + Portability: only link to -ldl if it is required.
  + Add support for 'file-db' to profiles: this is an absolute path
    to a immutable dconf database file.
  + Add support for finding profiles in XDG_DATA_DIRS if they are
    not in /etc.
  + Add 'dconf compile' command for building dconf databases from
    keyfiles in arbitrary locations (like from the build system of
    a project that may want to install a file-db).
  + Editor: add a section separator to the app menu for
    consistency.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

  + Updated translations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep 24 07:45:29 UTC 2013 - dimstar@opensuse.org

  + Updated translations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb 13 08:48:06 UTC 2013 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 0.15.3:
  + Fix problem related to empty changesets (caused by empty 'dconf
    load', for example).
  + New icons: hicolor icons have been updated and a HighContrast
    set added.
  + Loosen some assertions on the order of messages being returned
    from the service. D-Bus violates this order in the case that
    the service crashes and that's no reason to take the client
    with it as well.
  + Improve autogen.sh non-bash compatibility.
  + Add some backends to the dconf-service: The first backend is a
    null backend that allows for a temporary database tied to the
    lifetime of the session.
  + Also add a new 'keyfile' backend for the service. This is
    primarily intended to be used with NFS (where use of mmap is
    not safe).
  + Add a mkdir() in the case of an empty home directory where
    ~/.config/dconf does not already exist.
  + Fix crashes in the service caused by failures to write
    (including failures caused by the above issue being overlooked)
  + Work around an issue with a testcase hanging and failing due to
    a GLib change to the order in which testcases are run.
  + Running autoreconf on tarballs should now work.
  + Updated translations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Nov 24 22:46:56 UTC 2012 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 0.15.2:
  + Update to the new GVDB API (GBytes based) and refactor a bit
  + Add a new type of "database mode" DConfChangeset and use it
  + The service has been substantially rewritten
    - using gdbus-codegen
    - cache the file contents instead of read/modify/write each
      time
    - new DConfWriter abstraction allows considering support for
      backends
    - uses only POSIX IO (read and write syscalls) for database
      access
    - workaround mmap() bug on OpenBSD
  + Editor:
    - Fix search order of schema dirs
    - Translate summary and description
  + Updated translations.

      fullscreen state
  + dconf_rebuilder_get_parent: don't leak parent_name

  + Updated translations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 26 21:27:37 UTC 2012 - zaitor@opensuse.org

  + Updated translations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug 21 07:27:22 UTC 2012 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 0.13.90:
  + Updated translations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug  7 16:29:44 UTC 2012 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 0.13.5:
  + the service no longer attempts to migrate the primary dconf
    database from its (years) old path ~/.config/dconf to the new
    ~/.config/dconf/user
  + fixes for profile file parsing problems
  + fix obscure race in GDBus handling code that could result in
    out-of-order message delivery
  + editor:

- Update to version 0.13.4:
  + extensively refactored
  + API of libdconf has changed; soname bumped to libdconf.so.1
  + installed header layout has changed
  + there are changes to the API used between the client and the
    service.
  + there is a now a fairly decent test suite but it requires a
    full D-Bus environment to run in, so it may make sense to avoid
    'make check' on builders for the time being.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug  3 07:10:30 UTC 2012 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 0.13.0:

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug  3 06:37:48 UTC 2012 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Change the Requires dconf = %{version} to dconf >= %{version}.
  Whereas '=' might be correct, it will cause issues on later
  updates, when libdconf1 is coming to the distribution.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May  1 17:06:26 UTC 2012 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 0.12.1:

  + dconf update:
    - Code cleanup, better error handling.
    - Read keyfiles in a defined order (later files take
      precedence)

Sun Feb 13 13:56:19 CET 2011 - vuntz@opensuse.org
