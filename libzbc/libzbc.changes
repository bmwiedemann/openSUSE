Fri Jun 28 07:10:57 UTC 2019 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to new upstream release 5.8.0
  * This new release adds the new functions zbc_preadv() and
    zbc_pwritev() to support vectored read and write. The
    zbc_read_zone and zbc_write_zone tools are also updated to
    allow using these new functions with the new -vio option.
    Various bug fixes are also included.

- Update to new upstream release 5.7.1
  * Improved handling of non-SCSI zoned block devices.
  * Change the behavior of zbc_open() to return an error when
    trying to open a regular block device that was not
    initialized for the emulation mode using the zbc_set_zones.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Mar 18 21:47:12 UTC 2018 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 5.5.0
  * Fixed various problems with the fake backend driver
    (emulation mode), in particular when using a 4K sector disk
    as backend storage.
  * Properly set up direct I/O operation with the SG_IO interface
    (SCSI and ATA backend drivers).
  * Properly handle the maximum and optimal number of open zones
    for drives with no limit and drives not reporting any limit.
  * Skip open zone resource tests for drives with no limit or an
    unreported limit on the maximum/optimal number of open zones.
  * Add a new test to verify that a drive returns the correct
    ASC/ASCQ sense error codes when writing to a full zone (HM
    drives only).

- Update to new upstream release 5.3.1
  * A rewrite of libzbc introducing significant changes to the
    API. Support for draft standards 4.x is dropped. Compliance
    to the final ZBC/ZAC standards is improved.
  * All functions now operate using 512B sector units, regardless
    of the device actual logical block size. This is in line with
    Linux block device management and can simplify application
    implementation by unifying the addressing unit used when
    devices with different logical block sizes (512B or 4096B)
    are being used. Applications must however still comply with
    write request alignment to the device physical block size,
    which may be different from the 512B sector size unit used.
  * Improved read and write functions (zbc_pread and zbc_pwrite)
    to not limit the request size to the device maximum request
    data transfer size (calls are internally split into multiple
    requests).

- Update to new upstream release 4.3.3
  * block backend driver: support latest "official" kernel
    interface queued up for kernel 4.10 release.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 29 12:59:55 UTC 2016 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 4.3.0
* Properly handle detection of zoned block devices using sysfs
* Fixed handling of list view so that an operation on a zone does
  not reset the current selection and view whenever possible.
* Improved handling of the list view using a filter model.
* Added support for direct I/Os (O_DIRECT). Note: this does not
  work with SG node device files.
* Added maximum read/write command size in the device info
  structure.
* Initialize maximum device read/write I/O size for each backend
  driver.
* Check read/write command size against the maximum allowed for
  the device.
* Fixed get capacity: the code is now common for ATA and SCSI.
  This fixes problems in SCSI backend when RC_BASIS is 0 (report
  zones was being executed without the max logical sectors being
  set), and also adds RC_BASIS handling for ATA drives (this was
  missing entirely).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul  1 08:22:20 UTC 2016 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 4.1.1
* This release implements support for ZBC and ZAC revision 4 and
  above draft standards.
* Fixed the fake backend driver to pass all tests even if the
  device specified is very small (i.e. it has only a few sequential
  zones).
* Display SG_IO ioctl error message only when the log level is set
  to debug/verbose.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Feb 13 17:47:24 UTC 2016 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new git snapshot 2.0.0.g32
* Support for ZBC and ZAC r04
* Added block device backend driver for use with kernels providing
  SMR support and exposing host-managed disks as block devices.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov 12 19:13:31 UTC 2015 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new git snapshot 2.0.0~git113
* Added sense key and sense code string, DATA PROTECT and ZONE IS READ ONLY.
* Added filling sense key/sense code when reads spanning other types of zone.
* Supported storing ASC/ASCQ data on ata.
* Supported URSWRZ flag on SCSi.
* Added flags in zbc_device_info structure and stored URSWRZ flag in it.
* Added forced ata read/write flag to read/write using pass through command.
* Supported ZBC sense key, ASC/ASCQ handling.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun  8 23:11:56 UTC 2015 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new git snapshot 2.0.0~git65
* supports the ZBC standard draft Rev 02
  and Rev 01 of the ZAC standard draft
