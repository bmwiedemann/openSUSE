   see /usr/share/doc/packages/perl-Lexical-SealRequireHints/Changes

  version 0.011; 2017-07-15
  
    * update test suite to not rely on . in @INC, which is no longer
      necessarily there from Perl 5.25.7
  
    * no longer include a Makefile.PL in the distribution
  
    * update op-munging code to the PERL_OP_PARENT-compatible style
      (though none of it is actually used on Perls new enough to support
      PERL_OP_PARENT)
  
    * rename internal gen_*_op() functions into a better style
  
    * consistently use THX_ prefix on internal function names

- updated to 0.009
   see /usr/share/doc/packages/perl-Lexical-SealRequireHints/Changes

  version 0.009; 2015-03-20
  
    * in test of require for version checking, work around [perl #124135]
      which was introduced in Perl 5.21.4
  
  version 0.008; 2015-03-20
  
    * bugfix: don't localise hints around a version-number require, so that
      "use v5.10.0" can have its intentional effect of setting feature flags
  
    * bugfix: in pure Perl implementation, use a ($) prototype on
      CORE::GLOBAL::require, so that the argument expression will be in
      the correct context
  
    * better error message for refusing to use pure Perl implementation
      on Perl 5.9.4 to 5.10.0
  
    * document that the pure Perl implementation breaks the use of the
      implicit $_ parameter with require
  
    * in swash test, don't fail if utf8.pm was loaded unexpectedly early,
      as has been seen to happen on some systems
  
    * test idempotence
  
    * fix test for thread safety, which risked false negatives
  
    * when preemptively loading Carp and Carp::Heavy, avoid the Perl core
      bug regarding the context applied to file scope of required modules,
      in case of future versions of those modules becoming vulnerable and
      running on an old Perl
  
    * declare correct version for Test::More dependency
  
    * typo fix in documentation
  
    * typo fix in a comment
