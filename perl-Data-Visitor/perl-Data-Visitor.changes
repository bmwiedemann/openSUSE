   - doy/data-visitor should probably be the canonical repository at this
     point

   - The class callbacks to be run for an object are now chosen once, at the
     start of visiting that object. Previously, it always looked through the
     entire list of callbacks every time, in a loop in which the object in
     question could be changed by the callback. Since the class callbacks are
     only partially ordered, this lead to differences in whether a callback
     would be called or not based on hash order. reported by Robin Smidsr√∏d.
