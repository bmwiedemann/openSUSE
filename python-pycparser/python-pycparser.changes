- Update to version 2.14
  * Added CParser parameter to specify output directory for generated parsing
    tables (#84).
  * Removed lcc's cpp and its license from the distribution. Using lcc's cpp
    is no longer recommended, now that Clang has binary builds available for
    Windows.
  2.13:
  * Added support for offsetof() the way gcc implements it (special builtin
    that takes a type as an argument).
  * Added faked va_* macros (these are expected to come from stdarg.h)
  * Added a bunch more fake headers and typedefs to support parsing C projects
    like Git and SQLite without modifications to pycparser.
  * Added support for empty initializer lists (#79).
- Package fake_libc_include
  * switch to github release as pypi tarball don't contains all files
- Add 0002-Add-missing-typedef-sa_family_t-from-sys-socket.h.patch
  * upstream patch enhancing the fake_libc_include

- update to version 2.12:
  * This is a fix release for 2.11; the memory optimization with
    __slots__ on Coord and AST nodes didn't take weakrefs into
    account, which broke cffi and its many dependents (issue #76).
    Fixed by adding __weakref__ to __slots__.
- additional changes from version 2.11:
  * Add support for C99 6.5.3.7 p7 - qualifiers within array
    dimensions in function declarations. Started with issue #21
    (reported with initial patch by Robin Martinjak).
  * Issue #27: bug in handling of unified wstring literals.
  * Issue #28: fix coord reporting for 'for' loops.
  * Added ``examples/using_gcc_E_libc.py`` to demonstrate how ``gcc
    -E`` can be used instead of ``cpp`` for preprocessing.
  * Pull request #64: support keywords like const, volatile,
    restrict and static in dimensions in array declarations.
  * Reduce memory usage of AST nodes (issue #72).
  * Parsing order of nested pointer declarations fixed (issue #68).

Mon Aug 12 08:45:29 UTC 2013 - speilicke@suse.com

- Update to version 2.10:
  - A number of improvements in the handling of typedef-name ambiguities,
    contributed by Sye van der Veen in GitHub issue #1:
    * Allow shadowing of types by identifiers in inner scopes.
    * Allow struct field names to reside in a separate namespace and have
      the same names as types.
    * Allow duplicate typedefs in some cases to mimic real compiler behavior.
  - c_generator error for ExprList in expression context.
  - Assume default int type for functions whose argument or return types were
    not specified.
  - Relax the lexer a bit w.r.t. some integer suffixes and $ in identifier names
    (which is supported by some other compilers).
