- Update hslua to version 1.0.3.1.
  ### 1.0.3.1

  Released 2019-05-08.

  - Prevent filenames being treated as strings in debug messages.
    Lua's `loadbuffer` takes a `source` description as an argument,
    which is used for debug messages. The `loadfile` function now
    adds a special prefix (`@`) to `source`, thus marking it as a
    filename.

- Update hslua to version 1.0.3.
  ### 1.0.3

  Released 2019-05-04.

  - New module `Foreign.Lua.Module`, containing helper functions to
    define and load modules from Haskell.

  - Improve documentation of `open<lib>` (many thanks to Christian
    Charukiewicz.)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jan  6 03:01:19 UTC 2019 - psimons@suse.com

- Update hslua to version 1.0.2.
  ### 1.0.2

  Released 2019-01-05.

  - Fixed cross-compilation: placement of C import declarations
    were fixed, thereby resolving issues with cross-compilation.
    (Vanessa McHale and Faraz Maleknia)

  - Added .gitattributes file, fixing the wrong language
    classification of the GitHub repository. (Vanessa McHale)

  - Improved `toHaskellFunction` documentation. The documentation
    is now more specific on which Haskell exceptions are caught and
    which will lead to crashes.

- Update hslua to version 1.0.1.
  Upstream has edited the change log file since the last release in
  a non-trivial way, i.e. they did more than just add a new entry
  at the top. You can review the file at:
  http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hslua-1.0.1/src/CHANGELOG.md

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul 18 14:26:27 UTC 2018 - psimons@suse.com

- Cosmetic: replace tabs with blanks, strip trailing white space,
  and update copyright headers with spec-cleaner.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May 14 17:02:11 UTC 2018 - psimons@suse.com

- Update hslua to version 0.9.5.2.
  - Provide Optional as a replacement for OrNil. Exports of the latter
    have been fixed.
  - Provide utility function `raiseError`: Its argument will be thrown as
    an error in Lua.
  - Add `modifyLuaError`: The function lives in Foreign.Lua.Error and
    allows to alter error messages. This is most useful for amending
    errors with additional information.
  - Fixed a bug in `toList` which left a element on the stack if
    deserializing that element lead to an error. This also affected the
    FromLuaStack instance for lists.
  - Fixed a bug in `pairsFromTable` which left a key-value pair on the
    stack if either of them could not be read into the expected type. This
    also affected the FromLuaStack instance for Map.
  - Make Lua an instance of MonadMask: MonadMask from Control.Monad.Catch
    allows to mask asynchronous exceptions. This allows to define a
    finalizer for Lua operations.
  - Add functions and constants to refer to stack indices: The functions
    `nthFromBottom`, `nthFromTop` as well as the constants `stackTop` and
    `stackBottom` have been introduced. Numeric constants are less clear,
    and named constants can aid readability.
  - Add type OrNil: This type can be used when dealing with optional
    arguments to Lua functions.
  - Add function absindex: it converts the acceptable index `idx` into an
    equivalent absolute index (that is, one that does not depend on the
    stack top). The function calls `lua_absindex` when compiled with Lua
    5.2 or later; for Lua 5.1, it is reimplemented in Haskell.
  - Functions in `tasty` which have been deprecated have been replaced
    with non-deprecated alternatives.
  - Re-export more FunctionCalling helpers in `Foreign.Lua`: The typeclass
    `ToHaskellFunction` and the helper function `toHaskellFunction` are
    useful when working with functions. Importing them separately from
    `Foreign.Lua.FunctionCalling` was an unnecessary burden; they are
    therefor now re-exported by the main module.
  - Export registry-relatd constants `refnil` and `noref`: The constants
    are related to Lua's registry functions (`ref` and `unref`).
  - Add helper to convert functions into CFunction: A new helper
    `wrapHaskellFunction` is provided. It expects a
    HaskellImportedFunction userdata (as produced by
    `pushHaskellFunction`) on top of the stack and replaces it with a C
    function. The new function converts error values generated with
    `lerror` into Lua errors, i.e. it calls `lua_error`.
  - Add utility function `setglobal'`: It works like `setglobal`, but
    works with packages and nested tables (dot-notation only).
  - Add cabal flag 'export-dynamic': Default behavior is to include all symbols in
    the dynamic symbol table, as this enables users to load dynamic lua libraries.
    However, it is sometimes desirable to disable, e.g., when compiling a fully
    static binary. See jgm/pandoc#3986.
  - Increase user-friendlyness of error messages: The error message returned by
    `toHaskellFunction` hinted at the fact that the failing function is a Haskell
    function. This is mostly unnecessary information and might have confused
    users.
  - Added cabal flag to allow fully safe garbage collection: Lua garbage
    collection can occur in most of the API functions, even in those usually not
    calling back into haskell and hence marked as optimizable. The effect of this
    is that finalizers which call Haskell functions will cause the program to
    hang. A new flag `allow-unsafe-gc` is introduced and enabled by default.
    Disabling this flag will mark more C API functions as potentially calling back
    into Haskell. This has a serious performance impact.
  - `FromLuaStack` and `ToLuaStack` instances for lazy ByteStrings are added.
  - None-string error messages are handled properly: Lua allows error messages to
    be of any type, but the haskell error handlers expected string values. Tables,
    booleans, and other non-string values are now handled as well and converted to
    strings.
  - Use newtype definitions instead of type aliases for LuaNumber and LuaInteger.
    This makes it easier to ensure the correct numeric instances in situations
    where Lua might have been compiled with 32-bit numbers.
  - Instances of `FromLuaStack` and `ToLuaStack` for `Int` are removed. The
    correctness of these instances cannot be guaranteed if Lua was compiled with a
    non-standard integer type.
  - The flag `lua_32bits` was added to allow users to compile Lua for 32-bit
    systems.
  - When reading a list, throw an error if the lua value isn't a table instead of
    silently returning an empty list.
  - Tuples from pairs to octuples have been made instances of `FromLuaStack` and
    `ToLuaStack`.
  - New functions `dostring` and `dofile` are provided to load and run strings and
    files in a single step.
  - `LuaStatus` was renamed to `Status`, the *Lua* prefix was removed from its
    type constructors.
  - The constructor `ErrFile` was added to `Status`. It is returned by `loadfile`
    if the file cannot be read.
  - Remove unused FFI bindings and unused types, including all functions unsafe to
    use from within Haskell and the library functions added with 0.5.0. Users with
    special requirements should define their own wrappers and raw bindings.
  - The module *Foreign.Lua.Api.SafeBindings* was merge into
    *Foreign.Lua.Api.RawBindings*.
  - FFI bindings are changed to use newtypes where sensible, most notably
    `StackIndex`, `NumArgs`, and `NumResults`, but also the newly introduced
    newtypes `StatusCode`, `TypeCode`, and `LuaBool`.
  - Add functions `tointegerx` and `tonumberx` which can be used to get and check
    values from the stack in a single step.
  - The signature of `concat` was changed from `Int -> Lua ()` to
    `NumArgs -> Lua ()`.
  - The signature of `loadfile` was changed from `String -> Lua Int` to
    `String -> Lua Status`.
  - The type `LTYPE` was renamed to `Type`, its constructors were renamed to
    follow the pattern `Type<Typename>`. `LuaRelation` was renamed to
    `RelationalOperator`, the *Lua* prefix was removed from its constructors.
  - Add function `tolist` to allow getting a generic list from the stack without
    having to worry about the overlapping instance with `[Char]`.
  * Supported Lua Versions now include Lua 5.2 and Lua 5.3. LuaJIT and Lua 5.1
    remain supported as well.
  * Flag `use-pkgconfig` was added to allow discovery of library and include paths
    via pkg-config. Setting a specific Lua version flag now implies `system-lua`.
    (Sean Proctor)
  * The module was renamed from `Scripting.Lua` to `Foreign.Lua`. The code is now
    split over multiple sub-modules. Files processed with hsc2hs are restricted to
    Foreign.Lua.Api.
  * A `Lua` monad (reader monad over LuaState) is introduced. Functions which took
    a LuaState as their first argument are changed into monadic functions within
    that monad.
  * Error handling has been redesigned completely. A new LuaException was
    introduced and is thrown in unexpected situations. Errors in lua which are
    leading to a `longjmp` are now caught with the help of additional C wrapper
    functions. Those no longer lead to uncontrolled program termination but are
    converted into a LuaException.
  * `peek` no longer returns `Maybe a` but just `a`. A LuaException is thrown if
    an error occurs (i.e. in situtations where Nothing would have been returned
    previously).
  * The `StackValue` typeclass has been split into `FromLuaStack` and
    `ToLuaStack`. Instances not satisfying the law `x == push x *> peek (-1)` have
    been dropped.
  * Documentation of API functions was improved. Most docstrings have been copied
    from the official Lua manual, enriched with proper markup and links, and
    changed to properly describe hslua specifics when necessary.
  * Example programs have been moved to a separate repository.
  * Unused files were removed. (Sean Proctor)
  * New raw functions for `luaopen_base`, `luaopen_package`, `luaopen_string`,
    `luaopen_table`, `luaopen_math`, `luaopen_io`, `luaopen_os`, `luaopen_debug`
    and their high-level wrappers (with names `openbase`, `opentable` etc.)
    implemented.
  * Remove custom versions of `loadfile` and `loadstring`.
  * Drop support for GHC versions < 7.8, avoid compiler warnings.
  * Ensure no symbols are stripped when linking the bundled lua interpreter.
  * Simplify `tostring` function definition. (Sean Proctor)
  * Explicitly deprecate `strlen`. (Sean Proctor)
  * Add links to lua documentation for functions wrapping the official lua C API.
    (Sean Proctor).
