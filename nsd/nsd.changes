Tue Jul  9 17:52:44 UTC 2019 - Michael Ströder <michael@stroeder.com>

- New upstream release 4.2.1:
  * FEATURES:
    - Added num.tls and num.tls6 stat counters.
    - PR #12: send-buffer-size, receive-buffer-size,
      tcp-reject-overflow options for nsd.conf, from Jeroen Koekkoek.
    - Fix #14, tcp connections have 1/10 to be active and have to work
      every second, and then they get time to complete during a reload,
      this is a process that lingers with the old version during a version
      update.

  * BUG FIXES:
    - Fix #13: Stray dot at the end of some log entries, removes dot
      after updated serial number in log entry.
    - Fix TLS cipher selection, the previous was redundant, prefers
      CHACHA20-POLY1305 over AESGCM and was not as readable as it
      could be.
    - Consolidate server tls context create and remote control context
      create, with hardening for the remote control tls context too.
    - Fix to init event structure for reassignment.
    - Fix to init event not pointer, in reassignment.
    - Fix #15: crash in SSL library, initialize variables for TCP access
      when TLS is configured.
    - Fix tls handshake event callback function mistake, reported
      by Mykhailo Danylenko.
    - Initialize event structures before event_set, to stop uninitialized
      values from setting event library lists and assertions, that would
      sometimes also show after event_del.
    - Do not use symbol from libc, instead use own replacement, if not
      available, for accept4.
    - Fix output of nsd-checkconf -h.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun 11 18:43:46 UTC 2019 - Adam Majer <amajer@suse.com>

- New upstream release 4.2.0:
  * Implement TCP fast open
  * Added DNS over TLS
  * TLS OCSP stapling support with the tls-service-ocsp option
  * New option hide-identity can be used in nsd.conf to stop NSD
    from responding with the hostname for probe queries that
    elicit the chaos class response, this is conform RFC4892
  * Disable TLS1.0, TLS1.1 and weak ciphers, enable CIPHER_SERVER_PREFERENCE

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 25 18:50:27 UTC 2019 - Michael Ströder <michael@stroeder.com>

- Update to upstream release 4.1.27:
  * FEATURES:
    - Deny ANY with only one RR in response, by default.  Patch from
      Daisuke Higashi.  The deny-any statement in nsd.conf sets ANY
      queries over UDP to be further moved to TCP as well.
      Also no additional section processig for type ANY, reducing
      the response size.
    - Fix #4215: on-the-fly change of TSIG keys with patch from Igor, adds
      nsd-control print_tsig, update_tsig, add_tsig, assoc_tsig
      and del_tsig.  These changes are gone after reload, edit the
      config file (or a file included from it) to make changes that
      last after restart.
  * BUG FIXES:
    - Fix #4213: disable-ipv6 and dnstap compile error.
    - Fix to reduce region_log_stats if condition, this removes a
      debug statement.
    - Fix for FreeBSD port with dnstap enabled.
    - Fix to remove unused code.
    - Fix #6: nsd-control-setup: Change validity time to a shorter
      period (<2038).
    - Fix unused definition in header remote.h.
    - Fix #4236: IPV4_MINIMAL_RESPONSE_SIZE=1480 is slightly too big.
    - Fix #4235: IP_PMTUDISC_OMIT on IPv4/UDP sockets.
    - Fixed radtree_insert memory leak.
    - Fixed access recycled variable.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

    - Support SO_REUSEPORT_LB in FreeBSD 12 with the reuseport: yes
      option in nsd.conf.
    - Added nsd-control changezone.  nsd-control changezone name pattern
      allows the change of a zone pattern option without downtime for
      the zone, in one operation.
  * BUG FIXES:
    - Fix #4194: Zone file parser derailed by non-FQDN names in RHS of
      DNSSEC RRs.
    - Fix #4202: nsd-control delzone incorrect exit code on error.
    - Tab style fix to use tab for 8 spaces, from Xiaobo Liu.
    - Fix #4205: enable-recvmmsg in mixed IPv4/IPv6 environment fails.
      This sets the msg_hdr.msg_namelen correctly after receipt.
    - Fix to not set GLOB_NOSORT so the nsd.conf include: files are
      sorted and in a predictable order.
    - Fix #3433: document that reconfig does not change per-zone stats.
