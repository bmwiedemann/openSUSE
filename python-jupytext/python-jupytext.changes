- Update to 1.2.1
  + Improvements
    * Added documentation on how to use Jupytext with JupyterLab 0.35
    * and on using Jupytext with the pre-commit package manager
    * The `read` and `write` functions are easier to use
  + BugFixes
    * Jupytext now ships the ``jupyterlab-jupytext`` extension in version 1.0.2. The version 1.0.1 erroneously introduces a `target_formats` metadata in the jupytext section, instead of `formats`, and works only after two clicks.
- Update to 1.2.0
  + Improvements
    * New ``--execute`` option in Jupytext CLI
    * The ``--set-formats`` option in Jupytext CLI also triggers ``--sync``, allowing shorter commands.
    * ``jupytext``'s ``read`` and ``write`` functions can be used as drop-in replacements for ``nbformat``'s ones.
    * ``jupytext --sync`` will now skip unpaired notebooks.
    * The JupyterLab extension was updated. It now works on on text filesand has a new option to include
      (or not) the metadata in the text representation of the notebook.
    * Jupytext's contents manager class is derived dynamically from the default CM class for compatibility with
      ``jupyter_server``
    * Removed dependency on ``mock`` and ``testfixtures``, thanks to Jean-Sebastien Dieu
    * Added support for `.markdown` extension
  + BugFixes
    * The ``jupyterlab-jupytext`` extension shipped with the python package is in version 1.0.1, and is compatible only
      with JupyterLab >= 1.0. If you use an earlier version of JupyterLab, please install the version 0.19 of the extension
      with ``jupyter labextension install jupyterlab-jupytext@0.19``
    * Text files can be unpaired
- Update to 1.1.7
  + Improvements
    * Added support for Scala notebook, by Tobias Frischholz
    * Added a getting started notebook for jupytext (and Binder), by Chris Holdgraf
    * The Markdown and R Markdown representations are now tested for all the languages
    * The Jupytext notebook extension also works when the notebook is a text file
  + BugFixes
    * The Jupytext Menu in Jupyter Notebook is now compatible with ``jupyter_nbextensions_configurator``
    * Entries in the Jupytext menu are updated when the menu is hovered on
    * Fixed link to ``.md`` files in the documentation
- Update to 1.1.6
  + Improvements
    * Jupytext now supports Javascript and Typescript, thanks to Hatem Hosny
    * Jupytext works with Python 3.8 as well
  + BugFixes
    * Fix global ``auto`` pairing
- Update to 1.1.5
  + BugFixes
    * Fixed implicit dependency on ``jupyter_client``
- Update to 1.1.4
  + Improvements
    * New argument ``--set-kernel`` in Jupytext command line
    * Jupytext now accepts ``--to script`` or ``--to auto``
    * Jupytext now has a real Sphinx documentation on `readthedocs
      <https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_, thanks to Chris Holdgraf
  + BugFixes
    * Invalid notebooks may cause a warning, but not a fatal error
    * Jupyter server extension leaves the contents manager unchanged if it is a sub-class of Jupytext's CM
    * Fixed format inference when metadata is present but not format information
    * Preserve executable and encoding information in scripts with metadata
