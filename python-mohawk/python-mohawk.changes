- Update to version 1.0.0:
  * Security related: Bewit MACs were not compared in constant time
    and were thus possibly circumventable by an attacker.
  * Breaking change: Escape characters in header values (such as a
    back slash) are no longer allowed, potentially breaking clients
    that depended on this behavior.
  * A sender is allowed to omit the content hash as long as their
    request has no content. The `mohawk.Receiver` will skip the
    content hash check in this situation, regardless of the value
    of accept_untrusted_content.
  * Introduced max limit of 4096 characters in the Authorization
    header.
  * Changed default values of content and content_type arguments to
    `mohawk.base.EmptyValue` in order to differentiate between
    misconfiguration and cases where these arguments are explicitly
    given as None (as with some web frameworks).
  * Failing to pass content and content_type arguments to
    `mohawk.Receiver` or `mohawk.Sender.accept_response` without
    specifying accept_untrusted_content=True will now raise
    `mohawk.exc.MissingContent` instead of `ValueError`.
