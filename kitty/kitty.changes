  * A new last_used_layout function that can be mapped to a shortcut to switch to the previously used window layout (#870)
  * New neighboring_window and move_window functions to switch to neighboring windows in the current layout, and move them around, similar to window movement in vim (#916)

  * Add a new kitty --start-as command line flag to start kitty full-screen/maximized/minimized. This replaces the --start-in-fullscreen flag introduced in the previous release (#935)
  * When mapping the new_tab action allow specifying that the tab should open next to the current tab instead of at the end of the tabs list (#979)

  * Add a new kitty --start-in-fullscreen command line flag to start kitty in full screen mode (#856)
  * Linux: Do not enable IME input via ibus unless the GLFW_IM_MODULE=ibus environment variable is set. IME causes key processing latency and even missed keystrokes for many people, so it is now off by default.

- Update to 0.12.0:
  * Preserve the mouse selection even when the contents of the screen are scrolled or overwritten provided the new text does not intersect the selected lines.
  * Linux: Implement support for Input Method Extensions (multilingual input using standard keyboards) via IBus (#469)

  * Linux: Fix slow startup on some systems caused by GLFW searching for joysticks. Since kitty does not use joysticks, disable joystick support. (#830)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul 16 08:53:36 UTC 2018 - mvetter@suse.com

- Update to 0.11.3:
  * Draw only the minimum borders needed for inactive windows. That is only the borders that separate the inactive window from a neighbor. Note that setting a non-zero window margin overrides this and causes all borders to be drawn. The old behavior of drawing all borders can be restored via the draw_minimal_borders setting in kitty.conf.
  * Fix triple-click to select line not working when the entire line is filled (#703)
  * When dragging to select with the mouse "grab" the mouse so that if it strays into neighboring windows, the selection is still updated (#624)

  * Show a bell symbol on the tab if a bell occurs in one of the windows in the
    tab and the window is not the currently focused window

- Update to 0.9.0
  * A new kitty command shell to allow controlling kitty via
    commands. Press ctrl+shift+escape to run the shell.
  * The hints kitten has become much more powerful. Now in addition
    to URLs you can use it to select word, paths, filenames, lines,
    etc. from the screen. These can be inserted into the terminal,
    copied to clipboard or sent to external programs.
  * Switch to libxkbcommon for keyboard handling. It allows kitty to
    support XCompose and dead keys and also react to keyboard
    remapping/layout change without needing a restart.
  * Add support for multiple-key-sequence shortcuts
  * A new remote control command set-colors to change the current
    and/or configured colors.
  * When double-clicking to select a word, select words that continue
    onto the next/prev line as well.
  * Add an include directive for the config files to read multiple
    config files
  * Improve mouse selection for windows with padding. Moving the
    mouse into the padding area now acts as if the mouse is over
    the nearest cell.
  * Allow setting all 256 terminal colors in the config file
  * Fix using kitty --single-instance to open a new window in a
    running kitty instance, not respecting the --directory flag
  * URL hints: Exclude trailing punctuation from URLs
  * URL hints: Launch the browser from the kitty parent process
    rather than the hints kitten. Fixes launching on some systems
    where xdg-open doesn't like being run from a kitten.
  * Allow using rectangle select mode by pressing shift in addition
    to the rectangle select modifiers even when the terminal program
    has grabbed the mouse.
