- Update to version 1.0.13
  * Bug fixes
  version 1.0.12
  * Implemented the feature of auto adjusting content area.
  * Deviation parameters added into the settings dialog. The
    deviation default settings have been calibrated.
  * Improved: The follow page button is no more activated
    automatically on switching a sorting method or on going to the
    previous/next page.
  * Auto and original alignment modes reworked.
  * Added the ability to separately control vertical and
    horizontal automatic alignment when auto or original alignment
    mode enabled.
  version 1.0.11
  * Fixed a possible crash at the output stage: STA used the
    wrong crop area for background estimation.
  * UI fixes for the dialog of default parameters.
    version 1.0.10
  * Added color adjustments settings for color segmenter.
  * Fixed: rectangular picture auto zones are incorrectly shifted.
  * Support for any type of input image.
  * Default parameters don't more require processing to convert
    units. It caused a bug on margins stage.
  * Improved: a default parameters profile can now be edited.
  * Added page count info beside page number into status bar.
  * Posterization improved:
    + Posterization can now correctly handle with pale images.
    + It's become possible due to normalizing the source image
      before posterizing.
    + Added normalize option so as to add the ability to get
      normalized output.
    + Force b&w option has been reworked.
  * Improved: Follow page button is no more activated
    automatically on switching a filter if the button was inactivated
    before. Instead of that behavior ST now saves the sliders
    positions.
  * Note: The old behavior caused some problems of loosing the
    position of the page sequence worked on if not natural sorting
    enabled.
  * Collapsible filter options.
  * Added "Higher search sensitivity" option into picture shape
    options.
  * It gives the same search result as it was in Enhanced (&
    Featured) versions.
  * Deviation feature reworked and added sorting by decreasing
    deviation.
  version 1.0.9
  * Fixed: ST used Otsu instead of Wolf and Sauvola binarization
    methods in some cases, ignoring the user settings.
  * Fixed: ST could cut off edges of content in auto mode.
  * Added "Off" picture shape mode.
  * Fixed possible crash on switching from rectangular to another
    picture shape mode on some builds.
  * Support for processing of images with light content on dark
    background.
  * Fixed a lag on opening the settings dialog.
  * Added project version compatibility check.
  * Implemented page area feature.
  * Implemented new zone interaction modes feature.
  * Implemented saving zoom and focus on switching output tabs
    feature.
  * Implemented measurement units system feature.
  * Implemented status bar panel feature.
  * Implemented default parameters feature.
  * Implemented original background feature.
  * Implemented color segmenter and posterization feature.
  version 1.0.8
  * Hotfix for version 1.0.7
  * Warning! Old project files aren't compatible with this
    version, you mustn't even try to open project files of
    version 1.0.7 or earlier with this version.
  version 1.0.7
  * Fix for high DPI (ex. 4K) displays.
  * Pages without content box will be blank at output. A content
    box deleted manually won't more be reset to the page bounds on
    reloading.
  * On placing a new filling zone over another it now overlaps
    the older one.
  * "Quadro" picture shape mode was merged with rectangular. Also
    removed the restriction of ver. Featured on deleting all the auto
    zones. Before it resulted in resetting all the auto zones back.
  * Added sensitivity option. If sensitivity equals 25%, the
    results will be the same as they were in old "Quadro" mode, if
    100% - as in old "Rectangular".
  * Fixed bug come from ver. Featured: filling zones were set to
    wrong positions in their view after manual / marginal dewarping
    with post deskew enabled.
  * Auto detection of the white on black option for Sauvola and
    Wolf binarization methods on the first time processing.
  * Applied some fixes from ver. Universal.
  * Other improvements and fixes.
  * Warning! Old project files aren't compatible with this
    version.
  version 1.0.6
  * Fixed bug from Enhanced: applying manual deskew settings to a
    multitude of pages didn't work for the pages with a size
    different from that of the page the setting is applied to.
  * That resulted in resetting those pages to auto mode on
    processing. Also now deskew changes have effect on thumbnails
    instantly without forcing to reload the pages.
  * Start batch processing dialog from Enhanced removed.
  * Splitting output options are moved out of the color settings.
    Splitting options have its own "Apply To" dialog and button now.
  * Fixed a bug of the official ST: ST could crash on output when
    outer margins and content rectangle are "touch" by its sides on
    margins stage.
  * Fixed: on switching to manual alignment mode from any other
    the content rectangle was always placed at the top center instead
    of the place set by the align buttons.
  * Fixed: Subtracting picture zones, placed over an auto layer
    picture zone, no more blink on zoom.
  * Fixed: Picture zone type used wasn't sometimes saved on page
    switching.
  * Added option to control highlighting (with red asterisks) the
    thumbnails of pages with high deviation. The option refreshes the
    thumbnails instantly.
  * Fixed: page layout view didn't consider splitting settings.
    Corresponding improvements are done to thumbnails.
  * Fixed: on applying a content box to other pages it could be
    set out of the page bounds.
  * Fixed: possible mixed pixels in the output image of right
    page after splitting.
  * Various fixes of thumbnails drawing.
  * Changed Scan Tailor behavior on page split stage.
    + Reworked apply cut feature. Now on applying cut to the
      pages with different dimensions than the page the cut
      applied to, Scan Tailor tries to adapt cutters instead of
      fully rejecting the cut setting and switching to auto mode
      for those pages as it was before. The later was annoying as
      pages could be similar and had the difference in a few pixels.
    + Added check to reject invalid cut settings in manual mode.
    + UI: Added cutters interaction between each other. They
      can't more intersect each other, which created a wrong page
      layout configuration before.
  * Fixed bug from Enhanced: on select content stage after saving
    and reopening the project the thumbnail could change its
    position on the page loading when sorting enabled.
  * Now outside pixels of color images are filled with the
    background dominant color not gray. The respective feature has
    been implemented.
  * Also added filling setting with the following options:
    + Background: estimate the background and fill outside pixels
      with its color.
    + White: always fill with white.
  * Tiff compression feature reworked.
  * Now there are two options in settings dialog: B&W and color
    compression.
    + The B&W one has None, LZW, Deflate and CCITT G4 options.
    + The color one has None, LZW, Deflate and JPEG options.
  * Other changes.
  * Warning! Project files of older versions of ST are not
    compatible with this version.
  version 1.0.5
  * fixed: a page wasn't refreshed in output on changing its crop
    area;
  * equalize illumination option does no more depend on white
    margins.
  version 1.0.4
  * fixed bug from Enhanced: picture_shape in mixed mode wasn't
    saved in the project file that caused reloading page on every
    restart in output mode.
  * fixed: filling color wasn't adapted on brightness change.
  * improved output processing in B&W mode when illumination
    equalization disabled.
  version 1.0.3
  * Images libraries reconfigured (the old configuration could
    cause some problems with some images).
  * Warning for a user of a 32-bit system: the count of threads
    for multi-threaded batch processing is limited to 2 threads due
    to memory constraints. And that is intended only for systems with
    2GB RAM. If you have only 1GB RAM and lower, don't use this
    feature and set the count of threads to 1. Otherwise you are
    risking to get "out of memory" error.
    version 1.0.2
  * Added option to disable post-deskew on dewarping.
    It should be applied to a cover with geometric distortions
    and without any text lines which the auto-deskew algorithm
    could  rely on. Also it can be applied to pages with those that
    have non-horizontal text lines as part of the design and so the
    auto-deskew algorithm fails on that kind of pages.
    The setting is located at Output -> Dewarping -> Change... ->
    Post deskew
  * Fixed: Post-deskew on dewarping enabled now fills the outside
    pixels with the dominant gray color in a color mode.
  * Added option to control white on black mode for the adaptive
    binarization methods.
    It should be enabled when the text or content is lighter than
    the background.
  version 1.0.1
  * bug fixes.
  version 1.0.0

    the original repository and the features from Scan Tailor
    Featured and Scan Tailor Enhanced
