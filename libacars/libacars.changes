- Update to version 1.3.0
  * JSON output support for all message types. Any protocol tree
    can be serialized into a JSON string with
    la_proto_tree_format_json() function. Functions for serializing
    each individual message type into JSON are provided as well.
    Refer to doc/API_REFERENCE.md for details.
  * decode_acars_apps application now supports both human readable
    and JSON output. To enable JSON output, set LA_JSON environment
    variable to any value. If LA_JSON is not set, the program
    displays human readable output.
  * Small bugfixes in ACARS and MIAM decoders.

Wed Feb 27 20:00:36 UTC 2019 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 1.2.0
  * Added support for decoding Media Independent Aircraft Messaging
    (MIAM - ACARS label MA) version 1 and 2. All types of MIAM
    frames are decoded, provided that they fit in a single ACARS
    message. In case of multi-fragment MIAM messages only the first
    fragment is decoded (partially) due to lack of message
    reassembly support in libacars. This will be addressed in a
    future release.
    MIAM uses DEFLATE compression, hence libacars now optionally
    depends on zlib.  If zlib is not available at the build stage,
    MIAM decompression code will be disabled and many messages
    will be left undecoded.
  * `decode_acars_apps` is a new example application. It decodes
    all ACARS applications supported by libacars. This makes
    `decode_arinc` application obsolete
  * Minor bugfixes in the build system.
- Remove patch:
  * libacars-libsuffix.patch
