- Don't actually install com.endlessm.ParentalControls.rules: this
  just grants 'wheel'-group members access without password; as
  openSUSE does not support 'wheel' by default, we only ship the
  file as sample file (boo#1177974#c8).

- The library needs to require the daemon package as it is not
  usable without it. e.g. gnome-control-center -> applications wont
  list any informations.
