   Welcome! If you are wondering how to connect your digital camera and
   download images to a Linux PC, go to the [8]gPhoto homepage. My
   software is for processing those images after downloading them.

   If you're downloading JPEG files, you don't need my software at all.
   The image has already been processed inside the camera. Almost all
   digital cameras made since 1997 produce JPEG images, so why would you
   want to do it any other way?

   Well, despite the convenience and ubiquity of JPEG, there are some
   disadvantages. JPEG is a lossy format -- to fit a big image into a
   small file, a lot of information is thrown away. That's why midrange
   and high-end digital cameras offer an alternative: Raw, unprocessed CCD
   data files, for which the camera manufacturer provides special decoding
   software.

   Of course this software is for Windows and Macintosh only, with no
   source code. So it's useless to users of other operating systems,
   programmers hoping to design a better interpolation algorithm, and
   historians not yet born in an era when the only Windows machines will
   be in museums.

   So here is my mission: Write and maintain an ANSI C program that
   decodes any raw image from any digital camera on any computer running
   any operating system.

   That program is called [9]dcraw (pronounced "dee-see-raw"), and it's
   become a standard tool within and without the Open Source world. It's
   small (about 9000 lines), portable (standard C libraries only), free
   (both "gratis" and "libre"), and when used skillfully, produces better
   quality output than the tools provided by the camera vendor.

   [10]Here's my resume. I do freelance consulting related to dcraw, and
   I'm also available for full-time software work in the Northeast USA.

   I can be reached by sending e-mail to cybercom dot net with the
   username "dcoffin".

  My Code

   Unless otherwise noted in the source code, these programs are free for
   all uses, although I would like to receive credit for them. Donations
   are welcome too, if you're making money from my code.
   Make payments with PayPal - it's fast, free and secure!

   Note to Linux distributors: The only executable files that should be
   installed by a dcraw package are "dcraw", "clean_crw", and maybe
   "fuji_green", "fujiturn", and "fujiturn16". My shell scripts are
   dangerous and should only be installed in a "doc" directory without
   execute permission.
     * [17]dcraw.c -- decodes raw photos, extracts thumbnails, and
       displays metadata
       Supports 688 cameras at last count. Compile with "gcc -o dcraw -O4
       dcraw.c -lm -ljasper -ljpeg -llcms2" or "gcc -o dcraw -O4 dcraw.c
       -lm -DNODEPS". Run with no arguments to see a usage message. Don't
       complain that 16-bit output is too dark -- read the [18]FAQ!
     * [19]UNIX manpage for dcraw
       This is dcraw's official user documentation, updated in lockstep
       with the source code.
     * [20]rawphoto.c -- basic plugin for GIMP 1.2 & 2.0
       After installing "dcraw", do "gimptool --install rawphoto.c". My
       plugin provides a simple dialog box for loading raw files into the
       Gimp. [21]Udi Fuchs and [22]Joseph Heled have written much nicer
       plugins, with live preview, histograms, and color curves.
     * [23].badpixels -- my camera's "hot pixels"
       This file tells dcraw which pixels have died and when, so that it
       can interpolate around them.
     * [24]dcraw.c,v -- complete unabridged RCS file
       This file contains the entire history of dcraw.c since its
       conception on February 23, 1997. If you don't have the RCS toolkit,
       [25]download it here.
     * [26]parse.c -- read image data structures
       This program displays CIFF and TIFF data structures in a very
       cryptic format.
     * [27]clean_crw.c -- clean Canon CRW files
       Recovered or undeleted CRW files often have junk appended to them
       that makes them unreadable. This program safely cleans CRW files.
     * [28]fujiturn.c -- rotate Fuji Super CCD images
       An alternative to dcraw's built-in Fuji rotation.
     * [29]fuji_green.c -- convert Fuji green pixels to PGM
       A side benefit of the Fuji Super CCD design is that its green
       pixels make nice greyscale images.

   For hackers only:
     * [30]decompress.c is a simple reference decompressor for CRW files.
     * [31]sony_clear.c decrypts SRF files from the Sony DSC-F828.

  Internationalization

   To build and install multilingual dcraw in Linux, download the latest
   tarball [32]from this directory and run the "install" script. The
   currently supported languages are [33]Esperanto, [34]Russian,
   [35]French, [36]Italian, [37]German, [38]Portuguese, [39]Spanish,
   [40]Dutch, [41]Polish, [42]Hungarian, [43]Czech, [44]Swedish,
   [45]Catalan, [46]Danish, [47]Romanian, [48]Japanese, and Chinese (both
   [49]Traditional and [50]Simplified).

   To build a unilingual, self-contained DCRAW.EXE for DOS/Windows, use a
   source file [51]from this directory instead.

   To add another language, send me translations of [52]this manpage and
   [53]this message table in UTF-8 encoding. Translate only from my
   original English and Esperanto texts -- other languages may contain
   factual errors invisible to me.

   Do not translate "Cannot do X" as "It is impossible to do X". Dcraw is
   not perfect, so if it cannot do something, that does not mean that the
   task is impossible. Computers must never use the pronoun "I", so write
   "dcraw cannot do X".

   When in doubt, translate everything. I proofread these texts before
   releasing them, and it's much easier for me to correct over-translation
   than under-translation.

   Dcraw decodes raw photos, not raw files. No digital camera generates
   raw files in normal usage, there's always a header with useful
   metadata. (For abnormal usage, see CHDK and DIAG RAW below)

   "raw" is an English word, not an acronym or file format. "raw photo"
   should be translated with the same adjective that you would use for
   "crude oil" or "raw materials".

   There are dozens of raw photo formats: CRW, CR2, MRW, NEF, RAF, etc.
   "RAW Format" does not exist; it is an illusion created by dcraw's
   ability to read all raw formats.

  Other Raw Photo Decoders

   Dcraw has made it far easier for developers to support a wide range of
   digital cameras in their applications. They can call dcraw from a
   graphical interface, paste pieces of dcraw.c into their code, or just
   use dcraw.c as the documentation that camera makers refuse to provide:

  Frequently Asked Questions

   I don't have a C compiler. Could you send me an executable?
          Sergio Namias has built [106]some current Windows EXE files
          here. Dcraw has also been ported to [107]Amiga, [108]MorphOS,
          [109]BeOS, [110]OS/2, and [111]RISC OS.

   Why does dcraw say "Out of memory" in Windows Vista?
          Ostensibly to stop memory leaks, Microsoft decided that programs
          using the old MS-DOS API, including anything compiled with
          [112]DJGPP, shall be confined to 32MB of memory. This limitation
          can be removed by some combination of service packs and registry
          hacks, or you can compile dcraw to use the newer Win32 API.
          Thomas Nicely (of Pentium FDIV fame) has a [113]page describing
          the problem and various workarounds.

   How can I read the EXIF data (shutter speed, aperture, etc.)?
          [114]Phil Harvey's ExifTool provides a unified Perl-based EXIF
          reader (and editor!) for all cameras and file formats. "dcraw -i
          -v" is much faster, but provides less information.

   How can I read NEF files from Nikon scanners?
          Dcraw only supports cameras. Try [115]this simple program for
          scanners.

   How can I read Nikon Dust Off images (NDF files)?
          [116]Use this program.

   Do you have any specifications describing raw photo formats?
          Yes, but they tend to omit important details, like how to
          decompress the raw image or decrypt private metadata. See the
          [117]TIFF spec, the [118]TIFF/EP spec, the [119]Adobe DNG spec,
          the [120]CIFF (CRW) spec, and the [121]X3F spec.

   Where can I get an assortment of raw photos to test my software?
          For the latest cameras, I get samples from [122]Photography
          Blog. A "Full Review" at [123]Imaging Resource usually includes
          a few raw shots. [124]www.rawsamples.ch is no longer updated,
          but it has samples from older cameras. For $800, I sell a
          complete test suite on six DVDs containing every camera
          supported by dcraw, and provide web-based updates for $300/year.

   I'm designing a digital camera. How do I convert its raw photos into
          something that dcraw and Adobe Photoshop can open?
          Download [125]LibTIFF v3.8.2 and apply [126]this patch. Then use
          [127]this C program as a template for converting your photos to
          valid [128]Adobe DNG files.

   Why are dcraw output images larger than camera JPEGs?
          Any algorithm that combines each pixel with its neighbors is
          going to have problems near the edges. C code is cheap, so dcraw
          applies a different algorithm to edge pixels. Hardware logic is
          expensive, so cameras crop off the edge pixels after processing.

   I shot a raw photo with no light. Why does it appear all noisy, when it
          should be solid black?
          No matter how dark an image is, dcraw's auto-exposure stretches
          it so that one percent of its pixels appear white. The "-W"
          option avoids this behavior.

   I bracket plus/minus two stops, but all five shots look almost the same
          in dcraw. Why?
          See the previous question.

   Why is 16-bit output dark / unreadable?
          If you want pretty pictures straight out of dcraw, stay with
          8-bit output. 16-bit linear output is the best raw material for
          professional image editors such as [129]Photoshop and
          [130]CinePaint, but it's no good for most image viewers.

   What does the "-f" (four color RGB) option do?
          If you see patterns like [131]this or [132]this in your output
          images, first try "dcraw -a". If these patterns persist, use
          "dcraw -f" to get rid of them.

   Could you please add an option for TIFF / FITS / PNG / BMP / JPEG
          output?
          In versions 8.25 and later, "dcraw -T" writes TIFF output with
          metadata. To write other formats:

dcraw -c crw_0001.crw | pnmtofits > crw_0001.fits
dcraw -c crw_0001.crw | pnmtopng > crw_0001.png
dcraw -c crw_0001.crw | ppmtobmp > crw_0001.bmp
dcraw -c crw_0001.crw | cjpeg > crw_0001.jpeg

          I used the [133]Netpbm toolkit in these examples.
          [134]ImageMagick also does command-line format conversions. Both
          are free.

   Why don't you implement dcraw as a library?
          I have decided that dcraw shall be a command-line program
          written in C, and that any further abstraction layers must be
          added around this core, not inside it.

          Library code is ugly because it cannot use global variables.
          Libraries are more difficult to modify, build, install, and test
          than standalone programs, and so are inappropriate for file
          formats that change every day.

          There's a simpler way to make dcraw modular and thread-safe: Run
          it as a separate process. Eric Raymond [135]explains this
          technique here.

   Why are there false colors along edges within the image?
          Because of interpolation. This is a hard problem, easily
          defined:

         1. Take a three-color RGB image. At each pixel, set two color
            values to zero.
         2. Reconstruct the original three-color image as best you can
            from the remaining one color per pixel.

          Dcraw currently gives a choice of four methods: Bilinear,
          Variable Number of Gradients (VNG), Patterned Pixel Grouping
          (PPG), and Adaptive Homogeneity-Directed (AHD).

          [136]The Foveon X3 Capture chip requires a different kind of
          interpolation. Unlike CCD arrays, it captures three colors at
          every pixel location. But the colors are not well separated, so
          the raw data looks very gray. Much processing is needed to
          enhance color while suppressing noise.

   How do I get my camera to take raw photos?
          For Canon PowerShots that don't output CRW or CR2, you need the
          [137]CHDK hack.
          For some Nikon Coolpix cameras, you need to enable a
          [138]special "DIAG RAW" mode.
          For Casio cameras, see [139]Maurice Delaney's website or read
          [140]this discussion on dpreview.
          For the Minolta DiMAGE G400, G500, G530, or G600, go [141]here
          (in Russian) or [142]here (in English).
          For the Minolta DiMAGE Z2 and Nikon Coolpix 2100/3100/3700,
          [143]go here.
          For SMaL cameras, see the [144]camerahacking Forum.
          For Agfa and Samsung cameras, [145]go here.

          For other cameras, refer to the User's Manual.

   Does dcraw work with my camera?

          Most likely, yes. If your camera is not on the Supported list,
          try dcraw anyway. If it doesn't work perfectly, don't just sit
          quietly waiting for my next version. Ask me if I need any raw
          photos, or go ahead and post a photo to your website and e-mail
          me the URL. If you don't have a website, use [146]YouSendIt,
          [147]RapidShare, [148]Sendshack, [149]ShareFile, [150]sendspace,
          or [151]Megaupload.

          Before choosing a photo to send, read the next question:

   Why does dcraw output have a green tint and weak color?

          Because dcraw doesn't have a color matrix for your camera model,
          it outputs raw color instead of sRGB. To fix this, I need a
          photo of a [152]Wolf Faust, [153]ColorChecker, [154]CMP, or
          other calibrated color chart. Follow this checklist:

          + Use a real chart, not a printout or screen image.
          + Wait for sunny weather, local noon ± two hours.
          + Carefully brush any dust off the chart.
          + Tilt the chart 90° to the camera and 45° to the sun to avoid
            specular reflections.
          + Set the camera two meters away and use telephoto zoom.
          + Use the lowest ISO setting.
