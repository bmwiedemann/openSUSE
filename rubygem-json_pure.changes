- updated to version 1.8.3
 see installed CHANGES

  2015-09-11 (1.8.4)
    * There were still some mentions of dual GPL licensing in the source, but JSON
      has just the Ruby license that itself includes an explicit dual-licensing
      clause that allows covered software to be distributed under the terms of
      the Simplified BSD License instead for all ruby versions >= 1.9.3. This is
      however a GPL compatible license according to the Free Software Foundation.
      I changed these mentions to be consistent with the Ruby license setting in
      the gemspec files which were already correct now.
  2015-06-01 (1.8.3)

       JSON::GenericObject.json_createble = true
     as well.
