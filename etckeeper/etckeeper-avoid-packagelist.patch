Subject: add: AVOID_PACKAGELIST & ETCKEEPER_AVOID_PACKAGELIST
References: gh#joeyh/etckeeper#17
Upstream: sent (but not accept yet)

Because it is slow that some package manager make the packagelist
(eg, rpm -qa), high-level package manager might time out
(eg. zypper in/remove).
If you think that the packagelist is unnecessary, set AVOID_PACKAGELIST=1
in etckeeper.conf.
Or if you want to avoid it temporarily,
you can use environment variable ETCKEEPER_AVOID_PACKAGELIST=1 .
(eg, ETCKEEPER_AVOID_PACKAGELIST=1 zypper update).
