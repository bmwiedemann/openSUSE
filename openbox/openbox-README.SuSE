SuSE Linux 9.0 was the last release to have the old blackbox codebase based
openbox. Since openbox 3.0 it has been reimplemented from scratch as a
completely new windowmanager. This means that none of the old configurations
for openbox-2.x will work, new ones have to be made.

The 'obconf' (openbox configuration) program will aid in this.

Have a lot of fun,
