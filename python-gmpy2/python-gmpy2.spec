%description
gmpy2 is a C-coded Python extension module that supports
multiple-precision arithmetic. In addition to supporting
GMP or MPIR for multiple-precision integer and rational
arithmetic, gmpy2 adds support for the MPFR (correctly
rounded real floating-point arithmetic) and MPC (correctly
rounded complex floating-point arithmetic) libraries.
