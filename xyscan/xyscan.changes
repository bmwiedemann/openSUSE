- Update to version 4.1.0 (4.10)
  * The Windows version gets reintroduced in form a convenient
    binary installer.
  * For now the support of pdf files had to be dropped in the
    Window version.
  * On the Mac (and to some extent on Windows) it is now possible
    to open an image file with xyscan directly from the Finder
    (right-click then Open With). Works with the major file types
    such as png, gif, tif, jpg, and pdf.
- Update to version 4.0.0 (4.00)
  * This is a major rewrite of many parts of xyscan.
  * Changes were made to the GUI and support for PDF was added.
  * Some features that had stopped working, such as drag and drop,
    were restored.
  * The documentation was updated and simplified.
  * For certain platform-screen combinations (e.g. Retina) it is
    now possible to use even finer cursor adjustment steps than
    before (alt/option+arrow).
  * For this version, non-English language support was dropped.
- Update to version 3.3.3 (3.33)
  * This is only a maintenance release mostly for Mac OS 10.9.
  * xyscan now uses Qt 5.3. Few internal changes that were
    necessary due to the new Qtversion but nothing that affects
    the functionality.
  * For the Mac some adjustments were made to deal with Retina
    displays.
  * This version was not tested on Windows or Linux.
- Update to version 3.3.2 (3.32)
  * No upstream changelog.
- Many modifications to the .spec file to support Qt5.
- Rebase no-build-date.patch
- Change docs.patch to a sed script to support variable
  documentation installation directories.
- Use %suse_update_desktop_file to dynamically generate .desktop
  file instead of using a separate source file.
