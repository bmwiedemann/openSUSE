Tue Aug 24 08:35:20 UTC 2021 - John Paul Adrian Glaubitz <adrian.glaubitz@suse.com>

- Update to 1.5.7:
  UI
  --    
  - Added a new "hosts" page to browse and search reports by host name
  - Improved page HTML titles to be dynamic based on the context
  - Added a note highlighting if a task has been delegated to another host
    (https://github.com/ansible-community/ara/issues/282)
  - Improved how long file paths or playbook names are truncated and displayed
  API
  ---
  - Added a new read-only API endpoint: /api/v1/latesthosts
    It provides the latest playbook result for each host name.
    Under the hood, it implements the machinery for updating the latest host
    every time a host is created or deleted and includes a SQL migration to
    initially populate a new database table with the latest hosts.
  - Added a `delegated_to` field to results in order to record a host id to which
    a task has been delegated.
  - Added support for finding results delegated to a specific host:
    /api/v1/results?delegated_to=<host_id>
  Callback plugin
  ---------------
  - Fixed tasks and results being recorded out of order when using "strategy: free"
    (https://github.com/ansible-community/ara/issues/260)
  - Added support for recording 'delegate_to' on tasks
  Documentation
  -------------
  - Removed an unused sphinx lexer to allow recent versions of sphinx>=4
  - Created a new troubleshooting guide with common issues:
    https://ara.readthedocs.io/en/latest/troubleshooting.html
  - Added a database relationship graph to the endpoint documentation:
    https://ara.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api-documentation.html#relationship-between-objects
  Upgrade notes
  -------------
  It is always recommended to take a backup of your database before upgrading.
  This release includes two database migrations that must be run:
  - One for populating the data for the new /api/v1/latesthosts endpoint as well
    as the new 'hosts' page
  - One for adding a `delegated_to` field in the results.
    Note that delegated tasks will only be recorded as such from 1.5.7 on.
  - After upgrading to 1.5.7, database migrations can be run manually with the
    `ara-manage migrate` command if they are not taken care of automatically by the
    callback plugin.
  Known issues
  ------------
  - ara will not record task delegation for tasks that are skipped or for
    items in a loop that are skipped because Ansible doesn't provide the
    necessary information in those cases.
- from version 1.5.6
  UI
  --    
  - Refactored the built-in reporting UI with the bootstrap CSS framework using themes from bootswatch
  - Added a dark theme in addition to the default light theme (toggle at the top right)
  - Improved the mobile version of the reporting interface
  - Improved the playbook and task result tables
  - Revamped search forms for playbook and playbook results
  - Revamped hosts table in playbook reports
  - Added task results to the host details page that includes host facts
  - Moved ansible-playbook CLI arguments to a modal
  - Added an "about" modal with the version of ara and links to resources
  - Moved the link to the documentation to the "about" modal
  - Clicking on a host or task name in a playbook report will now filter results for that host or task
  - bugfix: Links to files including a lineno will now highlight that line (https://github.com/ansible-community/ara/issues/154)
  - bugfix: Fixed broken documentation link to ara_record (https://github.com/ansible-community/ara/issues/219)
  API
  ---
  - Playbook references will now always include CLI arguments, for example:
    /api/v1/tasks/1 ->
    {
      "id": 1,
      "playbook": {
        "id": 1,
        "arguments": {
          #...
        }
      }
    }
  Callback plugin
  ---------------
  - bugfix: Truncate play UUIDs given back by ansible-runner when running
    in serial (https://github.com/ansible-community/ara/issues/211)
- from version 1.5.5
  API
  ---    
  - Added support for searching playbooks by ansible_version, for example:
    /api/v1/playbooks?ansible_version=2.10
  UI
  --
  - Added syntax highlighting to task results
  - Added support for rendering nested results for tasks with loops
  - Added support for rendering diffs provided by "ansible-playbook --diff"
  - Added support for searching playbooks by ansible_version
  - The playbook links in the index no longer filter to changed results

  - Clicking on the logo or the "playbooks" link now discards existing search arguments
  CLI
  ---    
  - Added support for searching playbooks by ansible_version
  - Added missing argument for --controller to "ara playbook metrics"

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 15 08:27:33 UTC 2021 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.5.4:
  - ara playbook metrics: provides stats aggregated by name, path, ansible version or controller
  - ara host metrics: provides task result stats for hosts across playbooks
  - ara task metrics: provides duration stats aggregated by task name, action/module or path
  - Threading is now disabled by default to avoid running into sqlite locking contention
    For details, see: https://github.com/ansible-community/ara/issues/195
  - The callback didn't provide a timezone for timestamps which could result in a wrong
    interpretation by the API server. Timestamps are now provided as UTC.
  - The hostname of the controller that ran the playbook is now recorded by ara
  - ARA API server container images are now published to quay.io/recordsansible/ara-api
    in addition to hub.docker.com/r/recordsansible/ara-api.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul  3 14:57:08 UTC 2019 - Itxaka serrano <igarcia@suse.com>

- Move some requirements into recommends.
  Ara has changed and its no longer bundling the server with the
  main package, so most of the requirements related to the
  django server can be moved into recommends. Ara will raise a
  message if a user tries to execute the server part but the
  requirements are missing.
