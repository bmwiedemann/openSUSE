Carp::Assert is intended for a purpose like the ANSI C library
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assert.h. If you're already familiar with
assert.h, then you can probably skip this and go straight to the FUNCTIONS
section.

Assertions are the explicit expressions of your assumptions about the
reality your program is expected to deal with, and a declaration of those
which it is not. They are used to prevent your program from blissfully
processing garbage inputs (garbage in, garbage out becomes garbage in,
error out) and to tell you when you've produced garbage output. (If I was
going to be a cynic about Perl and the user nature, I'd say there are no
user inputs but garbage, and Perl produces nothing but...)

An assertion is used to prevent the impossible from being asked of your
code, or at least tell you when it does. For example:

    # Take the square root of a number.
    sub my_sqrt {
        my($num) = shift;

        # the square root of a negative number is imaginary.
        assert($num >= 0);

        return sqrt $num;
    }

The assertion will warn you if a negative number was handed to your
subroutine, a reality the routine has no intention of dealing with.

An assertion should also be used as something of a reality check, to make
sure what your code just did really did happen:

    open(FILE, $filename) || die $!;
    @stuff = <FILE>;
    @stuff = do_something(@stuff);

    # I should have some stuff.
    assert(@stuff > 0);

The assertion makes sure you have some @stuff at the end. Maybe the file
was empty, maybe do_something() returned an empty list... either way, the
assert() will give you a clue as to where the problem lies, rather than 50
lines down at when you wonder why your program isn't printing anything.

Since assertions are designed for debugging and will remove themelves from
production code, your assertions should be carefully crafted so as to not
have any side-effects, change any variables, or otherwise have any effect
on your program. Here is an example of a bad assertation:

    assert($error = 1 if $king ne 'Henry');  # Bad!

It sets an error flag which may then be used somewhere else in your
program. When you shut off your assertions with the $DEBUG flag, $error
will no longer be set.

Here's another example of *bad* use:

    assert($next_pres ne 'Dan Quayle' or goto Canada);  # Bad!

This assertion has the side effect of moving to Canada should it fail. This
is a very bad assertion since error handling should not be placed in an
assertion, nor should it have side-effects.

In short, an assertion is an executable comment. For instance, instead of
writing this

    # $life ends with a '!'
    $life = begin_life();

you'd replace the comment with an assertion which *enforces* the comment.

    $life = begin_life();
    assert( $life =~ /!$/ );
