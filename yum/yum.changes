-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb 23 08:44:08 UTC 2012 - saschpe@suse.de

- Update to version 3.4.3:
  * yum/__init__.py:  Don't call repo.doSetup() if we've already setup the
    repos.
  * yum/history.py, yum/rpmtrans.py:  Disable the rpmtrans chroot workaround.
    Use exclusive locking in history. 
  * yummain.py: Change the logging for NFS path problems from debug to critical.
  * yummain.py: Checks if we have read and write access in the current
    directory. If not, chdir to /.

    _(var), so localize literals instead.
  * cli.py: Don't show -c warning, when we've changed it due to --installroot.
  * yum/rpmtrans.py:  Workaround rpm chroot insanity, so we can use sqlite from
    unInstStop() cb.

Wed Apr  9 16:57:40 CEST 2008 - cthiel@suse.de

- update to version 3.2.14
  * memory footprint of yum should go down a bit thanks to some diligent
    byte-counting
  * a number of depsolving 'features' should have been fixed
  * translation updates
  * a number of unicode decode issues were fixed

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar 20 17:08:00 CET 2008 - cthiel@suse.de

- update to version 3.2.13
  * 3.2.13 shows a number of significant improvements over 3.2.12 not the
    least of which is a number of depsolving bugfixes. Additionally, James
    Antill has committed some code that slightly increases memory use during
    depsolving but increases the speed of certain depsolving routines
    between 30% and 60%.  A significant savings for a relatively small
    memory use (8-10%).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 18 11:27:35 CET 2008 - cthiel@suse.de

- update to version 3.2.12
  * installed_object.verify() works much like and/or better than rpm -Va
    does now and enables the yum-verify plugin
  * a number of memory saving improvements
  * speed ups in handling of excludes
  * for both of the ia64 users it is now enabled again!
  * when depsolving we've added a number of heuristics to pick the right
    provider from a list of providers. A couple of the heuristics include:
    - see if the sourcerpm of the providing and the requiring packages is
      the same
    - see if the most characters of the package name lead match. This helps
      with cases like both totem-lirc and xmms-lirc providing the library
      for totem-debuginfo.
  * write method for the comps object in yum to write out a compliant comps
    xml file based on the imported comps files.

  * when an obsolete is available for a package, only install most matching
    arch rather than all available arches (rh#301661)

  epoch (#331818)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct  5 23:01:27 CEST 2007 - cthiel@suse.de

- update to version 3.2.6
  * Mostly bug fixes in this version. A number of output changes which
    mostly just make it clearer whats going on when yum says things like
    'Nothing to do'.
  * also added a 'cost' option to repository and global configuration
    cost  relative  cost of accessing this repository. Useful for weighing
          one repo’s packages as greater/less than any other. defaults to
          1000
- changes in 3.2.5
  * We've fixed a good number of user-impacting bugs and cleaned up some
    medium-standing messes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep 18 11:59:11 CEST 2007 - cthiel@suse.de

- update default repos to include openSUSE 10.3

Wed Aug 29 23:14:33 CEST 2007 - cthiel@suse.de

- fix build

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug 29 19:58:37 CEST 2007 - cthiel@suse.de

- update to version 3.2.4
  * So, yum 3.2.3 had a few issues that needed some immediate addressing. 
    Mostly the depsolving was still off by a couple and a few output
    situations blew up using the new transaction callbacks. But never fear,
    it, and an array of other items have been addressed in 3.2.4 :)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug 23 15:22:41 CEST 2007 - cthiel@suse.de

- update to version 3.2.3
  * If you find a transaction aborted before it finished (or your computer
    went off or whatever) go to /var/lib/yum and compare the
    transaction-all.timestamp file with the transaction-done.timestamp file. 
    The things remaining in transaction-all that aren't in transaction-done
    are what is left to do.
  * If you're confused by -e and -d as debug and error log levels you'll
    be happy to see --verbose and --quiet.
  * A bunch of plugins which exclude pkgs should be much faster now.
  * If there is something else holding the yum lock file, yum will wait
    and try again.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug  7 15:25:09 CEST 2007 - cthiel@suse.de

- added yum-HEAD.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug  7 09:20:17 CEST 2007 - cthiel@suse.de

- update to version 3.2.2
  * integrated installonlyn plugin functionality - new config option
    installonly_limit will remove old, non-running kernels from your system
    as you add more. It defaults to off, though.
  * we're downloading and saving mirrorlists locally, now, for a cached
    default. So you don't have to grab them each time if you run frequently.
  * implement an extra rpm transaction check at the end of the depsolving.
    This will help us catch invalid depsolving we might be doing. Defaults
    to on.
  * bunch of depsolving issues, multilib depsolving issues, unicode output
    issues
  * See the changelog for the complete list
- changes in version 3.2.1
  * fixes to the depsolving to get it much more correct than it was in
    3.2.0
  * catch errors from yum-updatesd more gracefully
  * series of misc fixes for encoding breakages
  * 15% speed up of list  and list 'all' commands
  * yum search now returns results based on all search terms included and
    returns results ranked with most-matches at the top

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May 21 13:22:10 CEST 2007 - cthiel@suse.de

- update to version 3.2.0
  * latests stable release
- drop yum-install.patch, included in 3.2.0

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May  3 13:48:24 CEST 2007 - cthiel@suse.de

- added yum-3.1.7.patch to workaround bug #255914

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May  3 13:38:24 CEST 2007 - cthiel@suse.de

- update to version 3.1.7
  * We raised the minor version on yum-metadata-parser b/c we've increased
    the db version of the yum sqlite dbs to 10. yum 3.1.7 now has an
    explicit require on yum-metadata-parser 1.1.0
  * There have been a lot of changes since yum 3.1.6. The depsolver has
    changed around, we've merged optimizations from all sorts of folks and
    added in a couple of new features. As well we have hopefully fixed a
    number of bugs. :)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr 10 15:03:09 CEST 2007 - cthiel@suse.de

- added yum-install.patch by Jan Matejek which replaces $(PYDIR) with
  correct value, $(PKGDIR)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr  6 11:44:03 CEST 2007 - cthiel@suse.de

- update to version 3.1.6
  * 3.1.6 brings with it another round of fixes and optimizations to the
    depsolver. It also ports forward some changes from 3.0.X that were
    needed. This release should provide depsolver speed experience more
    inline with what we want.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 27 15:53:42 CEST 2007 - cthiel@suse.de

- update to version 3.1.5
  * This is a substantially less sucky yum 3.1.X release for those folks
    suffering with the depsolving rate in 3.1.4. It's still not great but
    it's a damned-sight better than it was. :)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar  9 09:10:01 CET 2007 - cthiel@suse.de

- minor typo fixes to repos.tar.bz2

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar  8 16:51:50 CET 2007 - cthiel@suse.de

- added repos.tar.bz2, which includes preconfigured openSUSE channels for yum (#245899)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar  8 14:50:12 CET 2007 - cthiel@suse.de

- update to version 3.1.4
  * We've fixed a few more things in the depsolver and optimized more of the
    sqlite look ups. As well as some slowdowns in excludePackages().

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar  1 21:33:41 CET 2007 - cthiel@suse.de

- update to version 3.1.3
  * more depsolver fixes on the new depsolver - it's probably working more
    accurately now, we hope. :)
  * properties - if you're using the yum module for doing any programming
    we've gotten rid of all of the need for things like doConfigSetup(),
    doRepoSetup(), doSackSetup(), etc. You can just reference the attribute
    you want and python properties will set it up for you automatically with
    the default config options. You can still call those functions, of
    course, but you only need to call them if you want to pass them
    different configuration options.
  * speed ups. We've made a lot of changes to our calls to query the sqlite
    dbs. Trimming out a lot of fat and also dumping some downright silly
    ways of doing things.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb 21 10:00:11 CET 2007 - cthiel@suse.de

- update to version 3.1.2
  * This is a development release and should not be used on systems where
    you value their continued functionality. That said, it passed all the
    release tests, for what those are worth. This is a big change from
    previous yum versions as we're doing all the dep solving inside yum. It
    doesn't download headers to do the dependency resolution.  It uses what
    information it has to do them. We were focusing on correctness with this
    release over many speedups. However, for a lot of simple cases it
    appears to be about the same as it was before, just w/o all the
    downloading during the dep resolution. We'll be adding in optimizations
    once we're more confident of the correctness of it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb  7 13:53:36 CET 2007 - cthiel@suse.de

- update to version 3.1.1
  * download sqlite db's directly if the repository was made with createrepo
    0.4.7 or higher using the -d option.
  * should be able to handle media:// urls quasi-sanely now
  * faster package name resolution in install/update/erase commands
  * addition of a utils base class to be used by yum-utils for simpler, more
    consistent commands.
- changelog for 3.1.0
  * This is mostly 3.0.3 + some new logging patches from Terje and Tim and
    some cleanups from James.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan  8 21:42:38 CET 2007 - cthiel@suse.de

    - fixes a dumb list of lists thing from the ListPackageSacks 
    - makes groupinstall work
  * yum/__init__.py: make package checking work again
  * yum/: depsolve.py, rpmsack.py: remove the ts.close() calls in rpmsack.
    See if it helps the rpmdb locking problems. Add in some debug output in
    the depsolving so we can see how much time is spent per dep and what
    kind of dep it is
  * yum/packages.py: Add missing 'self'
  * yum/parser.py: Urlgrabber will always be used here (especially since we
    don't import urllib)
  * output.py, yum-updatesd.py, yummain.py, yum/__init__.py,
    yum/depsolve.py, yum/packageSack.py, yum/repos.py: Remove a bunch of
    unused imports
  * yum/logginglevels.py: Replace catching Exception with IOError, which
    should catch all cases
  * yum/packages.py: Undo my previous patch, since it breaks how the sql
    package overrides returnChecksums
  * yum/packages.py: Remove unneeded use of lambda in some properties
  * cli.py: whitespace fix- thanks to terje rosten
  * yum/config.py: fix up the debuglevel and errorlevel so they are set
    appropriately from the cmdline to the conf
  * yum/mdparser.py: bring back self.total here too
  * callback.py, cli.py, output.py, progress_meter.py, shell.py,

    fixes, including unused imports, and removal of use of deprecated
    methods from the string module
  * output.py: get rid of deprecation warning
  * yum/packageSack.py: Re-enable using sack.searchAll in the provides
    command. This really speeds up things, since we'll pull fewer filelists
    for packages out of the db. Looks like this broke when the metasack was
    introduced. oops. ;)
  * yum/yumRepo.py: Remove unused code for manipulating the
    failure_obj during __get

    generation

    packages.py, repos.py, sqlitesack.py, storagefactory.py,
    yumRepo.py: 
    - lots of pychecker fixes 
    - remove duplicate code for checksumming
    - clean up some potential bugs
  * yum-updatesd.py, yum/parser.py: 
    - remove IncludingConfigParser,IncludedConfigParser 
    - make yum-updatesd.py use ConfigPreProcessor for include= config files

  * yum-python25-etree.patch, only require python-elementtree old dists
  * yum-error-vals.patch, fixes #214119

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct  5 11:36:09 CEST 2006 - cthiel@suse.de

- update to version 3.0
  * yum/depsolve.py: messing around with a few tests to figure out where it
    is slow.
  * shell.py, yum/depsolve.py: make the fix for pekka's bug more correct
  * shell.py: fix for the traceback Pekka reported - makes sure that our ts
    is reopened/intialized when the user decides to not run the transaction
    from the shell.
  * yum/plugins.py: replaced IncludingConfigParser with
    ConfigPreProcessor/ConfigParser in plugins, so i works like the rest of
    yum.

    remote location as a string that can be printed * get rid of some
    explicit uses of relativepath

    no attribute 'IncludingConfigParser' When running latest yum-cvs with
    plugins.

    http://path/to/file behave like I thought they should.

  * yum/: packages.py, repos.py: cleaned up Repository.setkeys as discussed
    on yum-devel
  * yum/config.py: Removed on the fly write-back support from the config
    classes. Added BaseConfig.write() instead. This is simpler and should
    use less memory. No-one was using the write support anyway.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Oct  1 11:27:28 CEST 2006 - cthiel@suse.de

- update to version 2.9.8
  * yum/rpmsack.py: minor fix to deprecated returnTupleByKeyword method in
    rpmsack.
  * cli.py: make sure we're not accidentally trying to install an old
    version
  * yum/repos.py: make excludes (and who knows how many other things) work
    again.  This, however, may not be the correct fix - willing to roll it
    back out
  * yum/packageSack.py: make sure we're only returning the newest from the
    metasack
  * yum/__init__.py: if we have a local copy of the package that checksums
    fine, use it instead of trying to do a range request from the end of the
    file
  * yum-updatesd.py: define a checkFailed signal so that watchers can notify
    users about failures to check for updates
  * yum/config.py: Commited James Bowes' inheritance fix and simplify the
    logic.
  * cli.py, shell.py, yumcommands.py, yum/plugins.py: Committed Bastiaan
    Bakker's command extension patch.
  * yum-updatesd.py: some error logging; avoid leaving a stale lock file
  * yum/packages.py: lazily populate prco to speed up rpmsack initialization
    when it's not needed
  * yum/packages.py: fix dep installs for locales like turkish where
    string.lower("I") != "i"
  * yum/logginglevels.py: if we can't connect to a syslog, don't die
  * yum/rpmsack.py: Removed unused excludes attribute and updated comments
  * yum/: __init__.py, config.py, yumRepo.py: As discussed privately with
    Paul Nasrat, merged YumRepository and RepoConf to help allow config
    dumping.
  * yum-updatesd.py: * actually time out after a few tries * catch another
    place we could potentially not unlock the pid file
  * yum/: packages.py, sqlitesack.py: swap arguments on __init__ for a few
    Package types so that we have consistency
  * yum/__init__.py: clean up some duplicate code to take advantage of the
    fact that the rpmdb is now a package sack
  * yum/yumRepo.py: we need to redo setupGrab() after changing callbacks so
    that our grabber has the right info.  this makes it so that we get
    progress feedback when downloading in pirut again
  * cli.py, yum/__init__.py: fix whatprovides based on a patch from Tim
    Lauridsen
  * yum/rpmsack.py: makePackageObject -> _makePackageObject
  * yum/__init__.py: Fixed the disk space check; it was failing because
    po.size can be a string.  Make the disk space check more readable by
    using the statvfs attributes.
  * yum/__init__.py: Prevent a KeyError that was occur during the disk space
    check because errors wasn't always initialised correctly. Added
    adderror() to avoid initialisation problems like this and minimise
    clutter.
  * yum/: __init__.py, packages.py: partial check in just to get it off my
    laptop: 1. do check for space in cache dir for downloading packages 2. 
    start changing around the way packages are checked
  * yum/: __init__.py, packages.py: get rid of silly code in verifyPkg()
  * yum/rpmsack.py: as I read through the changes: - clean up one docstring
    - make some of the list constructions using _search look the same
  * yum/rpmsack.py: make getNameArchPkgList() and getNamePkgList()
    consistent - if our pkglist is length zero then they would have traced
    back.
  * yum/: __init__.py, misc.py, packages.py: 
    - move refineSearchPattern into misc from YumBase 
    - clean up some pychecker errors
  * yum/rpmsack.py: Big cleanup of RPMDBPackageSack. Indexes are no longer
    built (buildIndexes).  This significantly reducing Yum's initialisation
    time and reduces memory footprint. Despite the lack of indexes almost
    all operations are faster.
  * cli.py, output.py, yum/__init__.py, yum/misc.py, yum/packages.py: 
    - fix up findDeps interface 
    - it now takes a list of package objects 
    - clean up a deprecation in deplistoutput 
    - remove RpmBase._prcoTuple2Printable() since it was no longer needed
      and only introduced in this devel series.
  * cli.py: more obvious error message for group not existing
  * cli.py: remove a bunch of unused imports
  * cli.py: use TYPE_INTERACTIVE instead of the deprecated TYPE_INTERFACE
  * rpmUtils/miscutils.py: make epoch output quasi-consistent for
    comparisons
  * yum/depsolve.py: add some debug output to depsolving
- require rpm >= 4.4
