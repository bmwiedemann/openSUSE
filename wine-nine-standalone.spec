%description
Gallium Nine allows to run any Direct3D 9 application with nearly no CPU
overhead, which provides a smoother gaming experience and increased FPS.

Gallium Nine Standalone, as the name implies, is a standalone version of the WINE parts of Gallium Nine.

This decouples Gallium Nine from the WINE tree, so that it can be used
with any WINE version. There is no need for any WINE patches. A stable,
development, or staging WINE release is sufficient.

Gallium Nine Standalone consists of two parts:

* d3d9-nine.dll: Gallium Nine Direct3D 9 library
* ninewinecfg.exe: GUI to enable/disable Gallium Nine with some additional info about the current state
