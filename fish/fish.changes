-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Nov 25 15:23:31 UTC 2017 - jaime.marquinez.ferrandiz@fastmail.net

- Update to 2.7.0. Notable improvements:
  * A new cdh (change directory using recent history) command provides a more
    friendly alternative to prevd/nextd and pushd/popd (#2847).
  * A new argparse command is available to allow fish script to parse arguments
    with the same behavior as builtin commands. This also includes the fish_opt helper command. (#4190).
  * Invalid array indexes are now silently ignored (#826, #4127).
  * Improvements to the debugging facility, including a prompt specific to the
    debugger (fish_breakpoint_prompt) and a status is-breakpoint subcommand (#1310).
  * string supports new lower and upper subcommands, for altering the case of
    strings (#4080). The case changing is not locale-aware yet.
  * string escape has a new --style=xxx flag where xxx can be script, var,
    or url (#4150), and can be reversed with string unescape (#3543).
  * History can now be split into sessions with the fish_history variable,
    or not saved to disk at all (#102).
  * Read history is now controlled by the fish_history variable rather than
    the --mode-name flag (#1504).
  * command now supports an --all flag to report all directories with the
    command. which is no longer a runtime dependency (#2778).
  * fish can run commands before starting an interactive session using the new 
    --init-command/-C options (#4164).
  * set has a new --show option to show lots of information about variables
    (#4265).
  * Full changelog: https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/releases/tag/2.7.0

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun  7 22:56:22 UTC 2017 - vilene@posteo.net

- Update to 2.6.0. Notable fixes and improvements:
  * Jobs running in the background can now be removed from the list of jobs
    with the new disown builtin, which behaves like the same command in other
    shells (#2810).
  * Command substitutions now have access to the terminal, like in other
    shells. This allows tools like fzf to work properly (#1362, #3922).
  * In cases where the operating system does not report the size of the
    terminal, the COLUMNS and LINES environment variables are used; if they
    are unset, a default of 80x24 is assumed.
  * New French (#3772 & #3788) and improved German (#3834) translations.
  * fish no longer depends on the which external command.
  * Full changelog: https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/releases/tag/2.6.0

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb  3 04:13:49 UTC 2017 - sflees@suse.de

- Update to 2.5.0
  Notable fixes and improvements
  * alias, run without options or arguments, lists all defined aliases, and 
    aliases now include a description in the function signature that identifies
    them.
  * complete accepts empty strings as descriptions (#3557).
  * command accepts -q/--quiet in combination with --search (#3591), providing 
    a simple way of checking whether a command exists in scripts.
  * Abbreviations can now be renamed with abbr --rename OLD_KEY NEW_KEY (#3610).
  * The command synopses printed by --help options work better with copying and 
    pasting (#2673).
  * help launches the browser specified by the $fish_help_browser variable if it
    is set (#3131).
  * History merging could lose items under certain circumstances and is now 
    fixed (#3496).
  * The $status variable is now set to 123 when a syntactically invalid command 
    is entered (#3616).
  * Exiting fish now signals all background processes to terminate, not just 
    stopped jobs (#3497).
  * A new prompt_hostname function which prints a hostname suitable for use in 
    prompts (#3482).
  * The __fish_man_page function (bound to Alt-h by default) now tries to 
    recognize subcommands (e.g. git add will now open the "git-add" man page) 
    (#3678).
  * A new function edit_command_buffer (bound to Alt-e & Alt-v by default) to 
    edit the command buffer in an external editor (#1215, #3627).
  * set_color now supports italics (--italics), dim (--dim) and reverse 
    (--reverse) modes (#3650).
  * Filesystems with very slow locking (eg incorrectly-configured NFS) will no 
    longer slow fish down (#685).
  * Improved completions for apt (#3695), fusermount (#3642), make (#3628), 
    netctl-auto (#3378), nmcli (#3648), pygmentize (#3378), and tar (#3719).
  * Added completions for:
        VBoxHeadless (#3378)
        VBoxSDL (#3378)
        base64 (#3378)
        caffeinate (#3524)

Tue Nov  8 11:49:49 UTC 2016 - aloisio@gmx.com

- Update to version 2.4.0
  ## Notable fixes and improvements
  * The documentation is now generated properly and with the 
    correct version identifier.
  * Automatic cursor changes are now only enabled on the 
    subset of XTerm versions known to support them, resolving a 
    problem where older versions printed garbage to the terminal 
    before and after every prompt (#3499).
  * Improved the title set in Apple Terminal.app.
  * Added completions for `defaults` and improved completions 
    for `diskutil` (#3478).
  # fish 2.4b1 (released October 18, 2016)
  ## Significant changes
  * The clipboard integration has been revamped with explicit 
    bindings. The killring commands no longer copy from, or 
    paste to, the X11 clipboard - use the new copy (`C-x`) and 
    paste (`C-v`) bindings instead. The clipboard is now 
    available on OS X as well as systems using X11 (e.g. Linux). 
    (#3061)
  * `history` uses subcommands (`history delete`) rather than 
    options (`history --delete`) for its actions (#3367). You 
    can no longer specify multiple actions via flags (e.g., 
    `history --delete --save something`).
  * New `history` options have been added, including `--max=n` 
    to limit the number of history entries, `--show-time` option 
    to show timestamps (#3175, #3244), and `--null` to null 
    terminate history entries in the search output.
  * `history search` is now case-insensitive by default (which 
    also affects `history delete`) (#3236).
  * `history delete` now correctly handles multiline commands 
    (#31).
  * Vi-style bindings no longer include all of the default 
    emacs-style bindings; instead, they share some definitions 
    (#3068).
  * If there is no locale set in the environment, various 
    known system configuration files will be checked for a 
    default. If no locale can be found, `en_US-UTF.8` will be 
    used (#277).
  * A number followed by a caret (e.g. `5^`) is no longer 
    treated as a redirection (#1873).
  * The `$version` special variable can be overwritten, so 
    that it can be used for other purposes if required.
  ## Notable fixes and improvements
  * The `fish_realpath` builtin has been renamed to `realpath` 
    and made compatible with GNU `realpath` when run without 
    arguments (#3400). It is used only for systems without a 
    `realpath` or `grealpath` utility (#3374).
  * Improved color handling on terminals/consoles with 8-16 
    colors, particularly the use of bright named color (#3176, 
    #3260).
  * `fish_indent` can now read from files given as arguments, 
    rather than just standard input (#3037).
  * Fuzzy tab completions behave in a less surprising manner 
    (#3090, #3211).
  * `jobs` should only print its header line once (#3127).
  * Wildcards in redirections are highlighted appropriately 
    (#2789).
  * Suggestions will be offered more often, like after 
    removing characters (#3069).
  * `history --merge` now correctly interleaves items in 
    chronological order (#2312).
  * Options for `fish_indent` have been aligned with the other 
    binaries - in particular, `-d` now means `--debug`. The 
    `--dump` option has been renamed to `--dump-parse-tree` 
    (#3191).
  * The display of bindings in the Web-based configuration has 
    been greatly improved (#3325), as has the rendering of 
    prompts (#2924).
  * fish should no longer hang using 100% CPU in the C locale 
    (#3214).
  * A bug in FreeBSD 11 & 12, Dragonfly BSD & illumos 
    prevented fish from working correctly on these platforms 
    under UTF-8 locales; fish now avoids the buggy behaviour 
    (#3050).
  * Prompts which show git repository information (via 
    `__fish_git_prompt`) are faster in large repositories 
    (#3294) and slow filesystems (#3083).
  * fish 2.3.0 reintroduced a problem where the greeting was 
    printed even when using `read`; this has been corrected 
    again (#3261).
  * Vi mode changes the cursor depending on the current mode 
    (#3215).
  * Command lines with escaped space characters at the end 
    tab-complete correctly (#2447).
  * Added completions for:
    + `arcanist` (#3256)
    + `connmanctl` (#3419)
    + `figlet` (#3378)
    + `mdbook` (#3378)
    +  `ninja` (#3415)
    +  `p4`, the Perforce client (#3314)
    +  `pygmentize` (#3378)
    +  `ranger` (#3378)
  * Improved completions for `aura` (#3297), `abbr` (#3267), 
    `brew` (#3309), `chown` (#3380, #3383),`cygport` (#3392), 
    `git` (#3274, #3226, #3225, #3094, #3087, #3035, #3021, 
    #2982, #3230), `kill & `pkill` (#3200), `screen` (#3271), 
    `wget` (#3470), and `xz` (#3378).
  * Distributors, packagers and developers will notice that 
    the build process produces more succinct output by default; 
    use `make V=1` to get verbose output (#3248).
  * Improved compatibility with minor platforms including musl 
    (#2988), Cygwin (#2993), Android (#3441, #3442), Haiku 
    (#3322) and Solaris .

  * fish_config can now properly be launched from the OS X app bundle (#3140).

- Notable fixes and improvements
  * Extra lines were sometimes inserted into the output under Windows (Cygwin 
    and Microsoft Windows Subsystem for Linux) due to TTY timestamps 
    not being updated (#2859).
  * The string builtin's match mode now handles the combination of -rnv (match, 
    invert and count) correctly (#3098).
  * Improvements to TTY special character handling (#3064), locale handling (#3124) 
    and terminal environment variable handling (#3060).
  * Work towards handling the terminal modes for external commands launched 
    from initialisation files (#2980).
  * Ease the upgrade path from fish 2.2.0 and before by warning users to restart 
    fish if the string builtin is not available (#3057).

   * Alt-# toggles the current command line between commented and 
     uncommented states, making it easy to save a command in

   * The fish_vi_mode function is now deprecated in favour of 
     fish_vi_key_bindings
- Backward-incompatible changes
   * Unmatched globs will now cause an error, except when used 
     with for, set or count (#2719, #2394) and and or will now bind
