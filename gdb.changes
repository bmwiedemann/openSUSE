- Mention changes in GDB 14:
  * GDB now supports the AArch64 Scalable Matrix Extension 2
    (SME2), which includes a new 512 bit lookup table register
    named ZT0.
  * GDB now supports the AArch64 Scalable Matrix Extension (SME),
    which includes a new matrix register named ZA, a new thread
    register TPIDR2 and a new vector length register SVG
    (streaming vector granule).  GDB also supports tracking ZA
    state across signal frames.  Some features are still under
    development or are dependent on ABI specs that are still in
    alpha stage.  For example, manual function calls with ZA state
    don't have any special handling, and tracking of SVG changes
    based on DWARF information is still not implemented, but there
    are plans to do so in the future.
  * GDB now recognizes the NO_COLOR environment variable and
    disables styling according to the spec.  See
    https://no-color.org/.  Styling can be re-enabled with
    "set style enabled on".
  * The AArch64 'org.gnu.gdb.aarch64.pauth' Pointer Authentication
    feature string has been deprecated in favor of the
    'org.gnu.gdb.aarch64.pauth_v2' feature string.
  * GDB now has some support for integer types larger than 64 bits.
  * Multi-target feature configuration.
    GDB now supports the individual configuration of remote
    targets' feature sets.  Based on the current selection of a
    target, the commands 'set remote <name>-packet (on|off|auto)'
    and 'show remote <name>-packet' can be used to configure a
    target's feature packet and to display its configuration,
    respectively.
  * GDB has initial built-in support for the Debugger Adapter
    Protocol.
  * For the break command, multiple uses of the 'thread' or 'task'
    keywords will now give an error instead of just using the
    thread or task id from the last instance of the keyword.  E.g.:
      break foo thread 1 thread 2
    will now give an error rather than using 'thread 2'.
  * For the watch command, multiple uses of the 'task' keyword will
    now give an error instead of just using the task id from the
    last instance of the keyword.  E.g.:
      watch my_var task 1 task 2
    will now give an error rather than using 'task 2'.  The
    'thread' keyword already gave an error when used multiple times
    with the watch command, this remains unchanged.
  * The 'set print elements' setting now helps when printing large
    arrays.  If an array would otherwise exceed max-value-size, but
    'print elements' is set such that the size of elements to print
    is less than or equal to 'max-value-size', GDB will now still
    print the array, however only 'max-value-size' worth of data
    will be added into the value history.
  * For both the break and watch commands, it is now invalid to use
    both the 'thread' and 'task' keywords within the same command.
    For example the following commnds will now give an error:
      break foo thread 1 task 1
      watch var thread 2 task 3
  * The printf command now accepts a '%V' output format which will
    format an expression just as the 'print' command would.  Print
    options can be placed withing '[...]' after the '%V' to modify
    how the value is printed.  E.g:
      printf "%V", some_array
      printf "%V[-array-indexes on]", some_array
    will print the array without, or with array indexes included,
    just as the array would be printed by the 'print' command.
    This functionality is also available for dprintf when
    dprintf-style is 'gdb'.
  * When the printf command requires a string to be fetched from
    the	inferior, GDB now uses the existing 'max-value-size'
    setting to the limit the memory allocated within GDB.  The
    default 'max-value-size' is 64k.  To print longer strings you
    should increase 'max-value-size'.
  * The Ada 2022 Enum_Rep and Enum_Val attributes are now
    supported.
  * The Ada 2022 target name symbol ('@') is now supported by the
    Ada expression parser.
  * The 'list' command now accepts '.' as an argument, which tells
    GDB to print the location around the point of execution within
    the current frame.  If the inferior hasn't started yet, the
    command will print around the beginning of the 'main' function.
  * Using the 'list' command with no arguments in a situation where
    the command would attempt to list past the end of the file now
    warns the user that the end of file has been reached, refers
    the user to the newly added '.' argument
  * Breakpoints can now be inferior-specific.  This is similar to
    the	existing thread-specific breakpoint support.  Breakpoint
    conditions can include the 'inferior' keyword followed by an
    inferior id (as displayed in the 'info inferiors' output).
    It is invalid to use the 'inferior' keyword with either the
    'thread' or 'task' keywords when creating a breakpoint.
  * New convenience function "$_shell", to execute a shell command
    and return the result.  This lets you run shell commands in
    expressions.  Some examples:
     (gdb) p $_shell("true")
     $1 = 0
     (gdb) p $_shell("false")
     $2 = 1
     (gdb) break func if $_shell("some command") == 0
  * New commands:
    * set debug breakpoint on|off
      show debug breakpoint
      Print additional debug messages about breakpoint insertion
      and removal.
    * maintenance print record-instruction [ N ]
      Print the recorded information for a given instruction.  If N
      is not given prints how GDB would undo the last instruction
      executed.  If N is negative, prints how GDB would undo the
      N-th previous instruction, and if N is positive, it prints
      how GDB will redo the N-th following instruction.
    * maintenance info frame-unwinders
      List the frame unwinders currently in effect, starting with
      the highest priority.
    * maintenance wait-for-index-cache
      Wait until all pending writes to the index cache have
      completed.
    * set always-read-ctf on|off
      show always-read-ctf
      When off, CTF is only read if DWARF is not present.  When on,
      CTF is read regardless of whether DWARF is present.  Off by
      default.
    * info main
      Get main symbol to identify entry point into program.
    * set tui mouse-events [on|off]
      show tui mouse-events
      When on (default), mouse clicks control the TUI and can be
      accessed by Python extensions.  When off, mouse clicks are
      handled by the terminal, enabling terminal-native text
      selection.
  * MI changes:
    * MI version 1 has been removed.
    * mi now reports 'no-history' as a stop reason when hitting the
      end of the reverse execution history.
    * When creating a thread-specific breakpoint using the '-p'
      option, the -break-insert command would report the 'thread'
      field twice in the reply.  The content of both fields was
      always identical.  This has now been fixed; the 'thread'
      field will be reported just once for thread-specific
      breakpoints, or not at all for breakpoints without a thread
      restriction.  The same is also true for the 'task' field of
      an Ada task-specific breakpoint.
      * It is no longer possible to create a thread-specific
      breakpoint for a thread that doesn't exist using
      '-break-insert -p ID'.  Creating breakpoints for
      non-existent threads is not allowed when using the CLI, that
      the MI allowed it was a long standing bug, which has now
      been fixed.
    * The '--simple-values' argument to the
      '-stack-list-arguments','-stack-list-locals',
      '-stack-list-variables', and '-var-list-children' commands now
      takes reference types into account: that is, a value is now
      considered simple if it is neither an array, structure, or
      union, nor a reference to an array, structure, or union.
      (Previously all references were considered simple.)  Support
      for this feature can be verified by using the
      '-list-features' command, which should contain
      "simple-values-ref-types".
    * The -break-insert command now accepts a '-g thread-group-id'
      option to allow for the creation of inferior-specific
      breakpoints.
    * The bkpt tuple, which appears in breakpoint-created
      notifications, and in the result of the -break-insert
      command can now include an optional 'inferior' field for both
      the main breakpoint, and each location, when the breakpoint
      is inferior-specific.
  * Python API:
    * gdb.ThreadExitedEvent added.  Emits a ThreadEvent.
    * The gdb.unwinder.Unwinder.name attribute is now read-only.
    * The name argument passed to gdb.unwinder.Unwinder.__init__
      must now be of type 'str' otherwise a TypeError will be
      raised.
    * The gdb.unwinder.Unwinder.enabled attribute can now only
      accept values of type 'bool'.  Changing this attribute will
      now invalidate GDB's frame-cache, which means GDB will need
      to rebuild its frame-cache when next required - either with,
      or without the particular unwinder, depending on how
      'enabled' was changed.
    * New methods added to the gdb.PendingFrame class.  These
      methods have the same behaviour as the corresponding
      methods on gdb.Frame.  The new methods are:
      * gdb.PendingFrame.name: Return the name for the frame's
        function, or None.
      * gdb.PendingFrame.is_valid: Return True if the pending
      	frame object is valid.
      * gdb.PendingFrame.pc: Return the $pc register value for
        this frame.
      * gdb.PendingFrame.language: Return a string containing the
        language for this frame, or None.
      * gdb.PendingFrame.find_sal: Return a gdb.Symtab_and_line
        object for the current location within the pending frame,
	or None.
      * gdb.PendingFrame.block: Return a gdb.Block for the current
        pending frame, or None.
      * gdb.PendingFrame.function: Return a gdb.Symbol for the
        current pending frame, or None.
    * The frame-id passed to gdb.PendingFrame.create_unwind_info
      can now use either an integer or a gdb.Value object for each
      of its 'sp', 'pc', and 'special' attributes.
    * A new class gdb.unwinder.FrameId has been added.  Instances
      of this class are constructed with 'sp' (stack-pointer) and
      'pc' (program-counter) values, and can be used as the
      frame-id when calling gdb.PendingFrame.create_unwind_info.
    * It is now no longer possible to sub-class the
      gdb.disassembler.DisassemblerResult type.
    * The Disassembler API from the gdb.disassembler module has
      been extended to include styling support:
      * The DisassemblerResult class can now be initialized with a
        list of parts.  Each part represents part of the
	disassembled instruction along with the associated style
	information.  This list of parts can be accessed with the
	new DisassemblerResult.parts property.
      * New constants gdb.disassembler.STYLE_* representing all the
        different styles part of an instruction might have.
      * New methods DisassembleInfo.text_part and
        DisassembleInfo.address_part which are used to create the
	new styled parts of a disassembled instruction.
      * Changes are backwards compatible, the older API can still
      	be used to disassemble instructions without styling.
    * New function gdb.execute_mi(COMMAND, [ARG]...), that invokes
      a GDB/MI command and returns the output as a Python
      dictionary.
    * New function gdb.block_signals().  This returns a context
      manager that blocks any signals that GDB needs to handle
      itself.
    * New class gdb.Thread.  This is a subclass of threading.Thread
      that calls gdb.block_signals in its "start" method.
    * gdb.parse_and_eval now has a new "global_context" parameter.
      This can be used to request that the parse only examine
      global symbols.
    * gdb.Inferior now has a new "arguments" attribute.  This holds
      the command-line arguments to the inferior, if known.
    * gdb.Inferior now has a new "main_name" attribute.  This holds
      the name of the inferior's "main", if known.
    * gdb.Inferior now has new methods "clear_env", "set_env", and
      "unset_env".  These can be used to modify the inferior's
      environment before it is started.
    * gdb.Value now has the 'assign' method.
    * gdb.Value now has the 'to_array' method.  This converts an
      array-like Value to an array.
    * gdb.Progspace now has the new method "objfile_for_address".
      This returns the gdb.Objfile, if any, that covers a given
      address.
    * gdb.Breakpoint now has an "inferior" attribute.  If the
      Breakpoint object is inferior specific then this attribute
      holds the inferior-id (an integer).  If the Breakpoint
      object is not inferior specific, then this field contains
      None.  This field can be written too.
    * gdb.Type now has the "is_array_like" and "is_string_like"
      methods.  These reflect GDB's internal idea of whether a
      type might be array- or string-like, even if they do not
      have the corresponding type code.
    * gdb.ValuePrinter is a new class that can be used as the base
      class for the result of applying a pretty-printer.  As a
      base class, it signals to gdb that the printer may implement
      new pretty-printer methods.
    * New attribute Progspace.symbol_file.  This attribute holds
      the gdb.Objfile that corresponds to Progspace.filename (when
      Progspace.filename is not None), otherwise, this attribute is
      itself None.
    * New attribute Progspace.executable_filename.  This attribute
      holds a string containing a file name set by the "exec-file"
      or "file" commands, or None if no executable file is set.
      This isn't the exact string passed by the user to these
      commands; the file name will have been partially resolved to
      an absolute file name.
    * A new executable_changed event registry is available.  This
      event emits ExecutableChangedEvent objects, which have
      'progspace' (a gdb.Progspace) and 'reload' (a Boolean)
      attributes.  This event is emitted when
      gdb.Progspace.executable_filename changes.
    * New event registries gdb.events.new_progspace and
      gdb.events.free_progspace, these emit NewProgspaceEvent and
       FreeProgspaceEvent event types respectively.  Both of these
       event types have a single 'progspace' attribute, which is
       the gdb.Progspace that is either being added to GDB, or
       removed from GDB.
    * gdb.LazyString now implements the __str__ method.
    * New method gdb.Frame.static_link that returns the outer
     frame of a nested function frame.

  already, which will pull the shared library. And the latter,
  because it's bogus since RPM auto generated dependency will take
  care of that requirement.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jun 11 22:51:37 UTC 2022 - Tom de Vries <tdevries@suse.com>

- Rebase to 12.1 release (as in fedora 36 @ 89947a7):
  * DBX mode is deprecated, and will be removed in GDB 13.

  * GDB 12 is the last release of GDB that will support building against
    Python 2.  From GDB 13, it will only be possible to build GDB itself
    with Python 3 support.

  * Improved C++ template support:
    GDB now treats functions/types involving C++ templates like it does function
    overloads.  Users may omit parameter lists to set breakpoints on families of
    template functions, including types/functions composed of multiple template types:
      (gdb) break template_func(template_1, int)
    The above will set breakpoints at every function `template_func' where
    the first function parameter is any template type named `template_1' and
    the second function parameter is `int'.
    TAB completion also gains similar improvements.

  * New commands:

    maint set backtrace-on-fatal-signal on|off
    maint show backtrace-on-fatal-signal
    This setting is 'on' by default.  When 'on' GDB will print a limited
    backtrace to stderr in the situation where GDB terminates with a
    fatal signal.  This only supported on some platforms where the
    backtrace and backtrace_symbols_fd functions are available.

    set source open on|off
    show source open
    This setting, which is on by default, controls whether GDB will try
    to open source code files.  Switching this off will stop GDB trying
    to open and read source code files, which can be useful if the files
    are located over a slow network connection.

    set varsize-limit
    show varsize-limit
    These are now deprecated aliases for "set max-value-size" and
    "show max-value-size".

    task apply [all | TASK-IDS...] [FLAG]... COMMAND
    Like "thread apply", but applies COMMAND to Ada tasks.

    watch [...] task ID
    Watchpoints can now be restricted to a specific Ada task.

    maint set internal-error backtrace on|off
    maint show internal-error backtrace
    maint set internal-warning backtrace on|off
    maint show internal-warning backtrace
    GDB can now print a backtrace of itself when it encounters either an
    internal-error, or an internal-warning.  This is on by default for
    internal-error and off by default for internal-warning.

    set logging on|off
    Deprecated and replaced by "set logging enabled on|off".

    set logging enabled on|off
    show logging enabled
    These commands set or show whether logging is enabled or disabled.

    exit
    You can now exit GDB by using the new command "exit", in addition to
    the existing "quit" command.

    set debug threads on|off
    show debug threads
    Print additional debug messages about thread creation and deletion.

    set debug linux-nat on|off
    show debug linux-nat
    These new commands replaced the old 'set debug lin-lwp' and 'show
    debug lin-lwp' respectively.  Turning this setting on prints debug
    messages relating to GDB's handling of native Linux inferiors.

    maint flush source-cache
    Flush the contents of the source code cache.

    maint set gnu-source-highlight enabled on|off
    maint show gnu-source-highlight enabled
    Whether GDB should use the GNU Source Highlight library for adding
    styling to source code.  When off, the library will not be used, even
    when available.  When GNU Source Highlight isn't used, or can't add
    styling to a particular source file, then the Python Pygments
    library will be used instead.

    set suppress-cli-notifications (on|off)
    show suppress-cli-notifications
    This controls whether printing the notifications is suppressed for CLI.
    CLI notifications occur when you change the selected context
    (i.e., the current inferior, thread and/or the frame), or when
    the program being debugged stops (e.g., because of hitting a
    breakpoint, completing source-stepping, an interrupt, etc.).

    set style disassembler enabled on|off
    show style disassembler enabled
    If GDB is compiled with Python support, and the Python Pygments
    package is available, then, when this setting is on, disassembler
    output will have styling applied.

    set ada source-charset
    show ada source-charset
    Set the character set encoding that is assumed for Ada symbols.  Valid
    values for this follow the values that can be passed to the GNAT
    compiler via the '-gnati' option.  The default is ISO-8859-1.

  * Changed commands:

    print
    Printing of floating-point values with base-modifying formats like
    /x has been changed to display the underlying bytes of the value in
    the desired base.  This was GDB's documented behavior, but was never
    implemented correctly.

    maint packet
    This command can now print a reply, if the reply includes
    non-printable characters.  Any non-printable characters are printed
    as escaped hex, e.g. \x?? where '??' is replaces with the value of
    the non-printable character.

    clone-inferior
    The clone-inferior command now ensures that the TTY, CMD and ARGS
    settings are copied from the original inferior to the new one.
    All modifications to the environment variables done using the 'set
    environment' or 'unset environment' commands are also copied to the new
    inferior.

    set debug lin-lwp on|off
    show debug lin-lwp
    These commands have been removed from GDB.  The new command 'set
    debug linux-nat' and 'show debug linux-nat' should be used
    instead.

    info win
    This command now includes information about the width of the tui
    windows in its output.

  * GDB's Ada parser now supports an extension for specifying the exact
    byte contents of a floating-point literal.  This can be useful for
    setting floating-point registers to a precise value without loss of
    precision.  The syntax is an extension of the based literal syntax.
    Use, e.g., "16lf#0123abcd#" -- the number of "l"s controls the width
    of the floating-point type, and the "f" is the marker for floating
    point.

  * MI changes:

   ** The '-add-inferior' with no option flags now inherits the
      connection of the current inferior, this restores the behaviour of
      GDB as it was prior to GDB 10.

   ** The '-add-inferior' command now accepts a '--no-connection'
      option, which causes the new inferior to start without a
      connection.

  * Python API:

    ** New function gdb.add_history(), which takes a gdb.Value object
       and adds the value it represents to GDB's history list.  An
       integer, the index of the new item in the history list, is
       returned.

    ** New function gdb.history_count(), which returns the number of
       values in GDB's value history.

    ** New gdb.events.gdb_exiting event.  This event is called with a
       gdb.GdbExitingEvent object which has the read-only attribute
       'exit_code', which contains the value of the GDB exit code.  This
       event is triggered once GDB decides it is going to exit, but
       before GDB starts to clean up its internal state.

    ** New function gdb.architecture_names(), which returns a list
       containing all of the possible Architecture.name() values.  Each
       entry is a string.

    ** New function gdb.Architecture.integer_type(), which returns an
       integer type given a size and a signed-ness.

    ** New gdb.TargetConnection object type that represents a connection
       (as displayed by the 'info connections' command).  A sub-class,
       gdb.RemoteTargetConnection, is used to represent 'remote' and
       'extended-remote' connections.

    ** The gdb.Inferior type now has a 'connection' property which is an
       instance of gdb.TargetConnection, the connection used by this
       inferior.  This can be None if the inferior has no connection.

    ** New 'gdb.events.connection_removed' event registry, which emits a
       'gdb.ConnectionEvent' when a connection is removed from GDB.
       This event has a 'connection' property, a gdb.TargetConnection
       object for the connection being removed.

    ** New gdb.connections() function that returns a list of all
       currently active connections.

    ** New gdb.RemoteTargetConnection.send_packet(PACKET) method.  This
       is equivalent to the existing 'maint packet' CLI command; it
       allows a user specified packet to be sent to the remote target.

    ** New function gdb.host_charset(), returns a string, which is the
       name of the current host charset.

    ** New gdb.set_parameter(NAME, VALUE).  This sets the gdb parameter
       NAME to VALUE.

    ** New gdb.with_parameter(NAME, VALUE).  This returns a context
       manager that temporarily sets the gdb parameter NAME to VALUE,
       then resets it when the context is exited.

    ** The gdb.Value.format_string method now takes a 'styling'
       argument, which is a boolean.  When true, the returned string can
       include escape sequences to apply styling.  The styling will only
       be present if styling is otherwise turned on in GDB (see 'help
       set styling').  When false, which is the default if the argument
       is not given, then no styling is applied to the returned string.

    ** New read-only attribute gdb.InferiorThread.details, which is
       either a string, containing additional, target specific thread
       state information, or None, if there is no such additional
       information.

    ** New read-only attribute gdb.Type.is_scalar, which is True for
       scalar types, and False for all other types.

    ** New read-only attribute gdb.Type.is_signed.  This attribute
       should only be read when Type.is_scalar is True, and will be True
       for signed types, and False for all other types.  Attempting to
       read this attribute for non-scalar types will raise a ValueError.

    ** It is now possible to add GDB/MI commands implemented in Python.

- Drop 32bit packages for s390x.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct 19 08:00:06 UTC 2021 - Tom de Vries <tdevries@suse.com>

- Fix SLE-15 s390x: unresolvable, nothing provides
  glibc-devel-static-32bit.
- Disable test-case gdb.base/break-interp.exp for SLE-11.
  It causes a
  "glibc detected *** expect: double free or corruption (out)" in
  expect and a subsequent runtest abort.  This might be the cause
  of the package build failure due to
  "Job seems to be stuck here, killed. (after 8hrs of inactivity)"
- Patches added:
  * gdb-testsuite-fix-gdb.base-step-over-syscall.exp-with-m32-amd-case.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 18 17:46:06 UTC 2021 - Tom de Vries <tdevries@suse.com> - 11.1

- Rebase to 11.1 release (as in fedora 35 @ 9cd9368):
  * Implements SLE-21561.
  * GDB now supports general memory tagging functionality if the
    underlying architecture supports the proper primitives and hooks.
    Currently this is enabled only for AArch64 MTE.
  * GDB will now look for the .gdbinit file in a config directory
    before looking for ~/.gdbinit.  The file is searched for in
    the following locations: $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gdb/gdbinit,
    $HOME/.config/gdb/gdbinit, $HOME/.gdbinit.
  * GDB will now load and process commands from
    ~/.config/gdb/gdbearlyinit or ~/.gdbearlyinit if these files
    are present.  These files are processed earlier than any of
    the other initialization files and can affect parts of GDB's
    startup that previously had already been completed before the
    initialization files were read, for example styling of the
    initial GDB greeting.
  * GDB now has two new options "--early-init-command" and
    "--early-init-eval-command" with corresponding short options
    "-eix" and "-eiex" that allow options (that would normally
    appear in a gdbearlyinit file) to be passed on the command
    line.
  * set startup-quietly on|off
    show startup-quietly
    When 'on', this causes GDB to act as if "-silent" were passed
    on the command line.  This command needs to be added to an
    early initialization file (e.g. ~/.config/gdb/gdbearlyinit)
    in order to affect GDB.
  * For RISC-V targets, the target feature
    "org.gnu.gdb.riscv.vector" is now understood by GDB, and can
    be used to describe the vector registers of a target.
  * TUI windows now support mouse actions.  The mouse wheel
    scrolls the appropriate window.
  * Key combinations that do not have a specific action on the
    focused window are passed to GDB.  For example, you now can
    use Ctrl-Left/Ctrl-Right to move between words in the command
    window regardless of which window is in focus.  Previously
    you would need to focus on the command window for such key
    combinations to work.
  * set python ignore-environment on|off
    show python ignore-environment
      When 'on', this causes GDB's builtin Python to ignore any
      environment variables that would otherwise affect how Python
      behaves.  This command needs to be added to an early
      initialization file (e.g. ~/.config/gdb/gdbearlyinit) in
      order to affect GDB.
  * set python dont-write-bytecode auto|on|off
    show python dont-write-bytecode
      When 'on', this causes GDB's builtin Python to not write any
      byte-code (.pyc files) to disk.  This command needs to be
      added to an early initialization file
      (e.g. ~/.config/gdb/gdbearlyinit) in order to affect GDB.
      When 'off' byte-code will always be written.
      When set to 'auto' (the default) Python will check the
      PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE environment variable.
  * break [PROBE_MODIFIER] [LOCATION] [thread THREADNUM]
        [-force-condition] [if CONDITION]
      This command would previously refuse setting a breakpoint if
      the CONDITION expression is invalid at a location.  It now
      accepts and defines the breakpoint if there is at least one
      location at which the CONDITION is valid.  The locations
      for which the CONDITION is invalid, are automatically
      disabled.  If CONDITION is invalid at all of the locations,
      setting the breakpoint is still rejected.  However, the
      '-force-condition' flag can be used in this case for forcing
      GDB to define the breakpoint, making all the current
      locations automatically disabled.  This may be useful if the
      user knows the condition will become meaningful at a future
      location, e.g. due to a shared library load.

- Use patchlist.pl to merge with gdb-7.9-10.fc22, a rebase to FSF GDB 7.9.
  The GDB 7.8 features are:
  * Python Scripting
   - You can now access frame registers from Python scripts.
   - New attribute 'producer' for gdb.Symtab objects.
  * New Python-based convenience functions:
   - $_caller_is(name [, number_of_frames])
   - $_caller_matches(regexp [, number_of_frames])
   - $_any_caller_is(name [, number_of_frames])
   - $_any_caller_matches(regexp [, number_of_frames])
  * New commands
   - queue-signal signal-name-or-number
     Queue a signal to be delivered to the thread when it is resumed.
  * On resume, GDB now always passes the signal the program had stopped
    for to the thread the signal was sent to, even if the user changed
    threads before resuming.  Previously GDB would often (but not
    always) deliver the signal to the thread that happens to be current
    at resume time.
  * Conversely, the "signal" command now consistently delivers the
    requested signal to the current thread.  GDB now asks for
    confirmation if the program had stopped for a signal and the user
    switched threads meanwhile.
  * "breakpoint always-inserted" modes "off" and "auto" merged.
    Now, when 'breakpoint always-inserted mode' is set to "off", GDB
    won't remove breakpoints from the target until all threads stop,
    even in non-stop mode.  The "auto" mode has been removed, and "off"
    is now the default mode.
  * MI changes
   - The -list-thread-groups command outputs an exit-code field for
     inferiors that have exited.
- removed (upstream) gdb-async-stopped-on-pid-arg-1of2.patch,
  gdb-async-stopped-on-pid-arg-testsuite.patch,

  * The "compare-sections" command now works on all targets.
  * The "target native" command now connects to the native target, and

- Update to gdb 6.8.
  * New native configurations
  NetBSD/hppa			hppa*-*netbsd*
  Xtensa GNU/Linux		xtensa*-*-linux*
  * New targets
  NetBSD/hppa			hppa*-*-netbsd*
  Xtensa GNU/Lunux		xtensa*-*-linux*
  * Change in command line behavior -- corefiles vs. process ids.
    When the '-p NUMBER' or '--pid NUMBER' options are used, and
    attaching to process NUMBER fails, GDB no longer attempts to open a
    core file named NUMBER.  Attaching to a program using the -c option
    is no longer supported.  Instead, use the '-p' or '--pid' options.
  * GDB can now be built as a native debugger for debugging Windows x86
  (mingw32) Portable Executable (PE) programs.
  * Pending breakpoints no longer change their number when their address
  is resolved.
  * GDB now supports breakpoints with multiple locations,
  including breakpoints on C++ constructors, inside C++ templates,
  and in inlined functions.
  * GDB's ability to debug optimized code has been improved.  GDB more
  accurately identifies function bodies and lexical blocks that occupy
  more than one contiguous range of addresses.
  * Target descriptions can now describe registers for PowerPC.
  * The GDB remote stub, gdbserver, now supports the AltiVec and SPE
  registers on PowerPC targets.
  * The GDB remote stub, gdbserver, now supports thread debugging on GNU/Linux
  targets even when the libthread_db library is not available.
  * The GDB remote stub, gdbserver, now supports the new file transfer
  commands (remote put, remote get, and remote delete).
  * The GDB remote stub, gdbserver, now supports run and attach in
  extended-remote mode.
  * hppa*64*-*-hpux11* target broken
    The debugger is unable to start a program and fails with the following
    error: "Error trying to get information about dynamic linker".
    The gdb-6.7 release is also affected.
  * GDB now supports the --enable-targets= configure option to allow
  building a single GDB executable that supports multiple remote
  target architectures.
  * GDB now supports debugging C and C++ programs which use the
  Decimal Floating Point extension.  In addition, the PowerPC target
  now has a set of pseudo-registers to inspect decimal float values
  stored in two consecutive float registers.
  * The -break-insert MI command can optionally create pending
  breakpoints now.
  * Improved support for debugging Ada
    Many improvements to the Ada language support have been made.  These
    include:
      - Better support for Ada2005 interface types
      - Improved handling of arrays and slices in general
      - Better support for Taft-amendment types
      - The '{type} ADDRESS' expression is now allowed on the left hand-side
	of an assignment
      - Improved command completion in Ada
      - Several bug fixes
  * New commands
  set print frame-arguments (all|scalars|none)
  show print frame-arguments
    The value of this variable can be changed to control which argument
    values should be printed by the debugger when displaying a frame.
  remote put
  remote get
  remote delete
    Transfer files to and from a remote target, and delete remote files.
  * New MI commands
  -target-file-put
  -target-file-get
  -target-file-delete
    Transfer files to and from a remote target, and delete remote files.
  * New remote packets
  vFile:open:
  vFile:close:
  vFile:pread:
  vFile:pwrite:
  vFile:unlink:
    Open, close, read, write, and delete files on the remote system.
  * GDB on GNU/Linux and HP/UX can now debug through "exec" of a new
  process.
  vAttach
    Attach to an existing process on the remote system, in extended-remote
    mode.
  vRun
    Run a new process on the remote system, in extended-remote mode.

    error: "Error trying to get information about dynamic linker".
    The gdb-6.7 release is also affected.

- allow build with old distributions, libexpat-devel is new in 10.3

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct 11 18:52:04 CEST 2007 - schwab@suse.de

- Update to gdb 6.7.
  * Resolved 101 resource leaks, null pointer dereferences, etc. in gdb, 
  bfd, libiberty and opcodes, as revealed by static analysis donated by
  Coverity, Inc. (http://scan.coverity.com).
  * When looking up multiply-defined global symbols, GDB will now prefer the
  symbol definition in the current shared library if it was built using the
  -Bsymbolic linker option.
  * When the Text User Interface (TUI) is not configured, GDB will now
  recognize the -tui command-line option and print a message that the TUI
  is not supported.
  * The GDB remote stub, gdbserver, now has lower overhead for high 
  frequency signals (e.g. SIGALRM) via the QPassSignals packet.
  * GDB for MIPS targets now autodetects whether a remote target provides
  32-bit or 64-bit register values.
  * Support for C++ member pointers has been improved.
  * GDB now understands XML target descriptions, which specify the
  target's overall architecture.  GDB can read a description from
  a local file or over the remote serial protocol.
  * Vectors of single-byte data use a new integer type which is not
  automatically displayed as character or string data.
  * The /s format now works with the print command.  It displays
  arrays of single-byte integers and pointers to single-byte integers
  as strings.
  * Target descriptions can now describe target-specific registers,
  for architectures which have implemented the support (currently
  only ARM, M68K, and MIPS).
  * GDB and the GDB remote stub, gdbserver, now support the XScale
  iWMMXt coprocessor.
  * The GDB remote stub, gdbserver, has been updated to support
  ARM Windows CE (mingw32ce) debugging, and GDB Windows CE support
  has been rewritten to use the standard GDB remote protocol.
  * GDB can now step into C++ functions which are called through thunks.
  * GDB for the Cell/B.E. SPU now supports overlay debugging.
  * The GDB remote protocol "qOffsets" packet can now honor ELF segment
  layout.  It also supports a TextSeg= and DataSeg= response when only
  segment base addresses (rather than offsets) are available.
  * The /i format now outputs any trailing branch delay slot instructions 
  immediately following the last instruction within the count specified.
  * The GDB remote protocol "T" stop reply packet now supports a
  "library" response.  Combined with the new "qXfer:libraries:read"
  packet, this response allows GDB to debug shared libraries on targets
  where the operating system manages the list of loaded libraries (e.g.
  Windows and SymbianOS).
  * The GDB remote stub, gdbserver, now supports dynamic link libraries
  (DLLs) on Windows and Windows CE targets.
  * GDB now supports a faster verification that a .debug file matches its binary
  according to its build-id signature, if the signature is present.
  * New commands
  set remoteflow
  show remoteflow
    Enable or disable hardware flow control (RTS/CTS) on the serial port
    when debugging using remote targets.
  set mem inaccessible-by-default
  show mem inaccessible-by-default
    If the target supplies a memory map, for instance via the remote
    protocol's "qXfer:memory-map:read" packet, setting this variable
    prevents GDB from accessing memory outside the memory map.  This
    is useful for targets with memory mapped registers or which react
    badly to accesses of unmapped address space.
  set breakpoint auto-hw
  show breakpoint auto-hw
    If the target supplies a memory map, for instance via the remote
    protocol's "qXfer:memory-map:read" packet, setting this variable
    lets GDB use hardware breakpoints automatically for memory regions
    where it can not use software breakpoints.  This covers both the
    "break" command and internal breakpoints used for other commands
    including "next" and "finish".
  catch exception
  catch exception unhandled
    Stop the program execution when Ada exceptions are raised.
  catch assert
    Stop the program execution when an Ada assertion failed.
  set sysroot
  show sysroot
    Set an alternate system root for target files.  This is a more
    general version of "set solib-absolute-prefix", which is now
    an alias to "set sysroot".
  info spu
    Provide extended SPU facility status information.  This set of
    commands is available only when debugging the Cell/B.E. SPU

Wed Dec 20 12:37:40 CET 2006 - schwab@suse.de

- Update to gdb 6.6.
  * New targets
  Xtensa				xtensa-elf
  Cell Broadband Engine SPU	spu-elf
  * GDB can now be configured as a cross-debugger targeting native Windows
  (mingw32) or Cygwin.  It can communicate with a remote debugging stub
  running on a Windows system over TCP/IP to debug Windows programs.
  * The GDB remote stub, gdbserver, has been updated to support Windows and
  Cygwin debugging.  Both single-threaded and multi-threaded programs are
  supported.
  * The "set trust-readonly-sections" command works again.  This command was
  broken in GDB 6.3, 6.4, and 6.5.
  * Support for GNU/Linux Thread Local Storage (TLS, per-thread variables) no
  longer requires symbolic debug information (e.g. DWARF-2).
  * New commands
  set substitute-path
  unset substitute-path
  show substitute-path
    Manage a list of substitution rules that GDB uses to rewrite the name
    of the directories where the sources are located. This can be useful
    for instance when the sources were moved to a different location
    between compilation and debugging.
  set trace-commands
  show trace-commands
    Print each CLI command as it is executed.  Each command is prefixed with
    a number of `+' symbols representing the nesting depth.
    The source command now has a `-v' option to enable the same feature.
  * REMOVED features
  The ARM Demon monitor support (RDP protocol, "target rdp").
  Kernel Object Display, an embedded debugging feature which only worked with
  an obsolete version of Cisco IOS.
  The 'set download-write-size' and 'show download-write-size' commands.
  * New remote packets
  qSupported:
    Tell a stub about GDB client features, and request remote target features.
    The first feature implemented is PacketSize, which allows the target to
    specify the size of packets it can handle - to minimize the number of
    packets required and improve performance when connected to a remote
    target.
  qXfer:auxv:read:
    Fetch an OS auxilliary vector from the remote stub.  This packet is a
    more efficient replacement for qPart:auxv:read.
  * Removed remote packets
  qPart:auxv:read:
    This packet has been replaced by qXfer:auxv:read.  Only GDB 6.4 and 6.5
    used it, and only gdbserver implemented it.

Neue Version 4.16.

gdb kompiliert nur mit libc 5.4.7 richtig. Mit 5.2.18 kann gdb

Ich waere dafuer, einfach das Binary von libc 5.4.7 zu benutzen.
Wird schon funktionieren...
