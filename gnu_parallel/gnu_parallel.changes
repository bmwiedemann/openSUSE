Sun Sep  1 06:50:27 UTC 2019 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to new release 20190822
  * {= uq; =} causes the replacement string to be unquoted.
  * --tagstring {=...=} is now evaluated for each line with
    --linebuffer.
  * Use -J ./profile to read a profile in current dir.
  * Speedup of startup by 40%: Find the parent shell differently
    on GNU/Linux, cache information about the CPU and which
    setpgrp method to use to make GNU Parallel start 40% faster.
  * $PARALLEL_SSHLOGIN can be used in the command line.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr 26 13:41:04 UTC 2019 - Ismail DÃ¶nmez <idonmez@suse.com>

- Update to new upstream release 20190422
  * 'env_parallel --end-session' makes it possible to nest
    'env_parallel --session'
  * --shard makes it possible to send input to the same jobslot
    based on the value in one column of the input.
    It is similar to sharding in databases.
  * --shellquote --shellquote will shell quote the input twice.
  * SIGTERM is changed to SIGHUP, so sending SIGHUP will make
    GNU Parallel start no more jobs, but wait for running jobs
    to finish.
  * SIGTERM SIGTERM is changed to SIGTERM, so sending SIGTERM
    will make GNU Parallel kill all running jobs.
  * Bug fixes and man page updates.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov 23 17:26:52 UTC 2018 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

  * parset sets exit code fixed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug  8 16:42:50 UTC 2018 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 20180722
  * The quoting engine has been changed. Instead of using
    \-quoting GNU Parallel now uses '-quoting in
    bash/ash/dash/ksh. This should improve compatibility with
    different locales. This is a big change causing this release
    to be alpha quality.
  * The CPU calculation has changed. By default GNU Parallel uses
    the number of CPU threads as the number of CPUs. This can be
    changed to the number of CPU cores or number of CPU sockets
    with --use-cores-instead-of-threads or
    --use-sockets-instead-of-threads.
  * The detected number of sockets, cores, and threads can be
    shown with --number-of-sockets, --number-of-cores, and
    --number-of-threads.

Fri May 25 17:53:59 UTC 2018 - astieger@suse.com

- update to 20180522:
  * --tty allows for more programs accessing /dev/tty in parallel.
    Some programs require tty access without using it.
  * env_parallel --session will record names in current environment
    in $PARALLEL_IGNORED_NAMES and exit. It is only used with
    env_parallel, and can work like --record-env but in a single
    session.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr 23 14:07:44 UTC 2018 - astieger@suse.com

  * Use '--limit myprog' to make a dynamic job limit. Just return 0
    to spawn another job, 1 to not spawn another job, and 2 to kill
    the youngest job.
  * PARALLEL_RSYNC_OPTS and --rsync-opts sets the options for rsync
    (Default: -rlDzR).

- Update to new upstream release 20170122
  * sql now uses a temporary credentials file for MySQL to avoid
    warnings.
  * --sqlmaster and --sqlworker have been reworked.
  * --sqlworker only reads from the DBURL: any command and any
    arguments are ignored.
  * --sqlmaster +DBURL will append commands to the DBURL and not
    erase the table.
  * If --results contain a replacement string, no tree structure
    with args will be generated.
  * --fg --tmux or --fg --tmuxpane will connect to the tmux.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jan  1 16:06:57 UTC 2017 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 20161222
  * --results foo.csv will save output as a CSV-file. Can be
    directly imported into R or LibreCalc.
  * When using --pipepart a negative --block-size is not
    interpreted as a block size but as the number of blocks each
    jobslot should have.
  * --sqlmaster/--sqlandworker will append jobs to the DBURL if the
    DBURL is prepended with +.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov 23 00:09:25 UTC 2016 - jengelh@inai.de

Tue Aug 30 08:47:57 UTC 2016 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 20160822
* --tmuxpane opens jobs in panes in tmux. Useful if you want to
  monitor progress of less than 100 simultaneous jobs.
* --linebuffer now treats \r as line ending, too.
* Perl changes forces use of floats to be given with leading
  zero, so 0.1 and not .1
* --xapply renamed to --link.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jul 31 17:52:04 UTC 2016 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 20160722
* env_parallel is now ready for wider testing. It is still beta
  quality.
* env_parallel is heavily modified for all shells and testing has
  been increased.
* Selectively choosing what to export using --env now works for
  env_parallel (bash, csh, fish, ksh, pdksh, tcsh, zsh).
* --round-robin now gives more work to a job that processes
  faster instead of same amount to all jobs.
* --pipepart works on block devices on GNU/Linux.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun 22 06:36:38 UTC 2016 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 20160622
* $PATH can now be exported using --env PATH. Useful if GNU
  Parallel is not in your path on remote machines.
* If --block is left out, --pipepart will use a block size that
  will result in 10 jobs per jobslot.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun May 22 14:57:17 UTC 2016 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 20160522
* niceload --net pauses the program if the internet connection
  is overloaded.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 21 23:06:02 UTC 2016 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 20160422
* :::+ and ::::+ work like ::: and :::: but links this input source
  to the previous input source in a --xapply fashion. Contrary to
  --xapply values do not wrap: The shortest input source determines
  the length.
* --line-buffer --keep-order now outputs continuously from the
  oldest job still running. This is more what you would expect than
  the earlier behaviour where --keep-order had no effect with
  --line-buffer.
* env_parallel supports tcsh, csh, pdksh. In fish it now supports
  arrays. In csh/tcsh it now supports variables, aliases, and
  arrays with no special chars. In pdksh it supports aliases,
  functions, variables, and arrays.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 22 22:05:36 UTC 2016 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 20160322

  * Bug fixes and man page updates.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jan 24 09:26:20 UTC 2016 - mpluskal@suse.com

- Update to 20160122
  * --sql DBURL uses DBURL as storage for jobs and output. It does
    not run any jobs so it requires at least one --sqlworker. DBURL
    must point to a table.
  * --sqlworker DBURL gets jobs from DBURL and stores the result
    back to DBURL.
  * --sqlandworker is a shorthand for --sql and --sqlworker.
  * --sqlworker requires the output of a single job to fit in
    memory.
  * --results now also saves a file called 'seq' containing the 
    sequence number.
  * If $PARALLEL_ENV is a file, then that file will be read into
    $PARALLEL_ENV.
  * man parallel_tutorial has been given an overhaul.
  * --workdir now accepts replacementstrings.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec 23 09:00:48 UTC 2015 - mpluskal@suse.com

- Update to 20151222
  * --transfer is now an alias for --transferfile {}.
  * --transferfile works like --transfer, but takes an argument
    like --return. This makes it possible to combine transferring
    files with multiple input sources:
    parallel -S server --tf {1} wc {2} {1} ::: * ::: -l -w -c
  * Bug fixes and man page updates.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Oct 24 10:59:28 UTC 2015 - mpluskal@suse.com

- Update to 20151022
  * --plus makes it possible to use {##} as a short had for {=
  	$_=$Global::JobQueue->total_jobs() =} which gives the the
		number of jobs to run.
	* {= $_=$Global::JobQueue->total_jobs() =} is incompatible with
		-X, -m, and --xargs.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Wed Sep  9 07:17:57 UTC 2015 - mpluskal@suse.com

- Update to 20150822
  * If $job->skip() is called in {= =} the job will not be run.
  * @arg can now be used in {= =}: parallel echo '{= $arg[2] < 5
    and $_="j" =}' ::: 1 2 3 ::: 4 5 6

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul 24 17:52:36 UTC 2015 - astieger@suse.com

- GNU parallel 20150722:
  * If a record fits in a block, --block only reads upto the size
    of --block. If not: --block reads a full --block more.
  * Due to widely spread distributions still using --tollef even
    after a  year of being retired following a year of being
    obsolete, --tollef now gives an error unless used with --gnu.
  * --nice now uses a perl wrapper instead of the nice command.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jul 19 20:55:17 UTC 2015 - astieger@suse.com

- GNU parallel 20150622:
  * --halt has been rewritten completely. You can now combine
    percentages with success or fail. See the man page.
  * Exit values 102..254 have been removed. 101 means more than 100
    jobs failed.
  * Killing through --timeout, --memfree, or --halt is now done as
    a process group.
  * --termseq determines which signals are sent when a job is
    killed.
  * An empty argument would previously cause no string to be
    inserted. This is now changed to '' being inserted, thus
    prepending a space to the output of: parallel echo {} b ::: ''
  * $PARALLEL_ENV can now be set to an environment prepending the
    command. Used in env_parallel as mentioned in the manpage.
  * --retry-failed will retry all failed jobs in a joblog. It will
    ignore any command given.
  * --ssh and $PARALLEL_SSH can be used to set the command used for
    ssh. The command is assumed to behave the same way as ssh.
  * --fifo now works in csh, too.
  * Q(...) can be used in {= =} to shell quote a string.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat May 23 19:17:45 UTC 2015 - astieger@suse.com

- GNU parallel 20150522: [boo#932143]
  * Security: The security issue for --sshlogin + --fifo/--cat has
    been fixed. Thereby all issues with
    http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/parallel/2015-04/msg00045.html
    have been fixed.
  * Security: After further security analysis the issue fixed in
    20150422 also fixed the problem for --tmux.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Apr 26 19:38:50 UTC 2015 - astieger@suse.com

- GNU parallel 20150422:
  * Security fix: A local attacker could make a user overwrite one
    of his own files with a single byte when using --compress,
    --tmux, --pipe, --cat or --fifo when guessing random file names
    within a time window of 15 ms. [boo#928664]
  * --shuf will generate all jobs, and shuffle them before running
    them. This is useful to get a quick preview of the results before
    running the full batch.
  * Bug fixes and man page updates.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Sun Mar 22 20:14:15 UTC 2015 - astieger@suse.com

- GNU parallel 20150322:
  * --number-of-cores respects 'taskset' on GNU/Linux.
  * --joblog --pipe gives the data send and received in the log.
  * GNU Parallel was tested to support 100 GB sized records in
    --pipe. A few bugs was fixed to support >2 GB records. It works,
    but is rather slow.
  * Bug fixes and man page updates.
- remove fdupes, not required

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar  5 19:10:04 UTC 2015 - astieger@suse.com

- GNU parallel 20150222:
  * --tmux has gotten a major overhaul.
  * Bug fixes and man page updates.
- includes changes from 20150122:
  * Remote jobs now send stderr (standard error) to stderr
    (standard error) instead of stdout (standard output).
  * Remote execution command is now packed using base64 encoded
    bzip2. This means that big environments (app. 100 KB) can be
    transferred. This change makes remote execution alpha quality.
  * --semaphoretimeout now takes a negative value. This means give
    up if the semaphore is not gotten within the timeout.
  * --halt -1 and -2 now means halt if a job succeeds (so the
    opposite of 1 and 2).
  * --no-keep-order will reverse --keep-order.
  * Bash's second fix of shellshock caused --env to break again
    when exporting functions. This has been fixed again.
  * A semibig refactoring of big functions. All non-trivial
    functions are now less than 100 lines. The refactoring makes
    this release beta quality.
  * A description of the design decisions for GNU Parallel can be
    found in 'man parallel_design'.
  * A bug fix in replacement strings caused rewrite of the
    replacement function. This makes use of replacement strings
    alpha quality.
  * Bug fixes and man page updates.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec  8 00:41:08 UTC 2014 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 20141122
* Remote systems can be divided into hostgroups (e.g. web and db)
  by prepending '@groupname/' to the sshlogin. Multiple groups can
  be given by separating groups with '+'.
  E.g. @web/www1 @web+db/www2 @db/mariadb
* Remote execution can be restricted to servers that are part of
  one or more groups by '@groupname' as an sshlogin. Multiple
  groups can be given by separating groups with '+'.
  E.g. -S @web or -S @db+web

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug  6 04:28:53 UTC 2014 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 20140722
* {= perl expression =} can be used as replacement string. The
  expression should modify $_. E.g. {= s/\.gz$// =} to remove .gz
  from the string. This makes replacement strings extremely flexible.
* Positional perl expressions (similar to {2}) are given as
  {=2 perl expression=} where 2 is the position.
* One small backwards incompatability: {1}_{2} will replace {2}
  with the empty string if there is only one argument. Previously,
  {2} would have been left untouched.
* Replacement strings can be defined using --rpl. E.g. parallel
  --rpl '{.gz} s/\.gz$//' echo {.gz} ::: *.gz
* --tmux will direct the output to a tmux session instead of files.
  Each running jobs will be in its own window.
* --halt 10% will stop spawning new jobs if 10% failed so far.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jun 28 21:05:51 UTC 2014 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 20140622
* The "--pipepart" option works with "--header", "--regexp",
  "--cat" and "--fifo".
* "{%}" works as job slot.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May 26 08:31:42 UTC 2014 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 20130522
* --tollef has been retired. The format of --eta and --joblog has
  changed slightly.
* added --pipepart, a highly efficient alternative to --pipe if the
  input is a real file and not a pipe. If using --cat or --fifo
  with --pipe, the {} in the command will be replaced with the name
  of a physical file and a fifo respectively containing the block
  from --pipe.
* --controlmaster is no longer experimental.
* --env is now copied when determining CPUs on remote system. It is
  useful for copying $PATH if parallel is not in the normal path.
* --results now chops the argument if the argument is longer than
  the allowed path length.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Nov 23 10:23:17 UTC 2013 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 20131122
* A citation notice is printed on stderr only if stderr is a
  terminal, the user has not specified --no-notice, and the user
  has not run --bibtex once.
* --compress will compress temporary files.
* --compress-program controls which program to use for compressing
  temporary files.
* --bar shows progress as a progress bar compatible with zenity.
* --resume can now be used with --result:
  jobs already run will be skipped.
* --transfer and --basefile support paths relative to the --workdir
  by inserting /./ into the path.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 28 11:35:36 UTC 2013 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 20131022
* Using --transfer with files containing /./ in the path will copy
  the files relative to the --workdir. The maximal command length
  is now cached in a file, halving the startup time.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 30 23:34:39 UTC 2013 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 20130922
* PDF-files of documentation is now included. Bugfixes and man page

* --env can now transfer the Bash function for remote execution.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jun 23 05:41:30 UTC 2013 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 20130522
* --ctrlc is now the default if --pipe is not used, making it
  possible to kill remotely-started jobs simply by pressing Ctrl-C.
* --timeout 200% now means "kill jobs which take more than twice
  the time of the median runtime of a job".
* Jobs are now distributed round-robin when having mulitiple
  --sshlogin, instead of filling up one --sshlogin at a time.
- Update to new upstream release 20130622
* --xapply now recycles arguments if an input source has more
  arguments than others.
* The sleep time between jobs is now both increased and decreased
  exponentially.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun 20 11:36:03 UTC 2013 - coolo@suse.com

- add fix-pod-syntax.diff to fix build with perl 5.18

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May  8 17:30:12 UTC 2013 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 20130422
* --ctrlc will send SIGINT to tasks running on remote computers and
  thus killing them.
* --load now uses `ps` to see immediately see the number of running
  processes instead of `uptime` thus making --load react much faster.
*  --retries works with --onall.
* --nice works under tcsh.
