        before release. Thanks @shlomif! [Github #67][Github #68]
  
      - Improved performance when no work needed to be done. Thanks

      - Fixed log format methods (errorf, warnf, infof, etc...) not

      [Fixed]
  
      - Fixed more method aliases in Log::Any::Adapter::Syslog that were
        mapped to invalid syslog priorities. Thanks @legaultp for the
        patch!

      [Fixed]
  
      - Fixed version of Log::Any::Adapter::Syslog so that installing it
        will also install the rest of Log-Any.
  
      - Fixed method aliasing in Log::Any::Adapter::Syslog for "error"
        log method. Thanks @legaultp for the patch!
  
  1.051     2017-08-06 20:41:53-05:00 America/Chicago (TRIAL RELEASE)
  
      [Fixed]
  
      - LOG_ANY_DEFAULT_ADAPTER now correctly logs to the given adapter.
  
        Previously, if no other adapter was set, Log::Any used it's
        default, super-fast "Null" proxy that simply drops all messages
        without checking adapters. Now Log::Any will correctly detect the
        environment variable and create the correct, normal proxy object.
  
        Thanks @tm604 for the report and @mephinet for the patch!
  
  1.050     2017-08-03 22:28:37-05:00 America/Chicago (TRIAL RELEASE)
  
      [Added]
  
      - Added structured logging to easily log single hash references in
        a parsable format. Thanks @mephinet!
  
      - Added contextual logging to attach information to log messages
        based on the current context.
  
        For example, all log messages being generated by a particular HTTP
        request could be logged with the URL, even if they're from a part
        of the application that doesn't know what HTTP is.
  
        This is very similar to Log::Log4perl's Mapped Diagnostic Context.
  
        Thanks @mephinet!

  1.049     2017-03-28 16:02:10-05:00 America/Chicago
  
      [Fixed]
  
      - Fixed failing tests on Windows because of path separator
        interpolation. Thanks @nanis [Github #56]
  
      - Added explicit core dependency on Sys::Syslog in case of Perls
        with non-standard core libraries. Thanks @nanis [Github #57]
  
  1.048     2017-03-27 15:16:12-05:00 America/Chicago
  
      - No changes since 1.047 trial release
  
  1.047     2017-03-22 20:22:47-05:00 America/Chicago (TRIAL RELEASE)
  
      [Fixed]
  
      - Fixed backwards-compatibility with users using the Unix::Syslog
        macros in Log::Any::Adapter::Syslog. This requires that the user
        have Unix::Syslog installed (which Log::Any does not explicitly
        depend on).
  
      - Log level aliases are now case-insensitive to match the regular
        log levels. Prior to this, "WARNING", "Warning", and "warning"
        would all work, but "WARN", and "Warn" would not, only "warn".
        Thanks to @0x62ash for reporting this issue. [Github #55]
  
      - Invalid log levels for the File, Stderr, and Stdout adapters now
        result in a warning, and the default level of "trace" is used.
        Previously, no warning would be issued and no logs would be
        generated. Thanks to @0x62ash for reporting this issue. [Github
        #55]
  
  1.046     2017-01-11 21:22:57-06:00 America/Chicago (TRIAL RELEASE)
  
      [Added]
  
      - The Syslog adapter is now part of the core distribution, since it
        relies only on core Perl modules.

      [Fixed]
  
      - Imported log object can now be called anything instead of just
        `$log`. This means `use Log::Any '$LOG'` or `use Log::Any '$foo'`
        now work.
  
  1.043     2016-11-03 21:31:18-05:00 America/Chicago (TRIAL RELEASE)
  
      [Fixed]
  
      - Objects that overload stringification are now stringified
        correctly (instead of run through Data::Dumper). Thanks @mephinet!

  1.042     2016-08-26 23:37:33-05:00 America/Chicago
  
      [Added]
  
      - Default adapters can now be configured with arguments (thanks
        @bjakubski!)
  
  1.041     2016-08-18 00:00:10-05:00 America/Chicago (TRIAL RELEASE)
  
      [Added]
  
      - Logging methods now return the formatted log string so that it can
        be used in a `die` or `warn` call.
  
      [Changed]
  
      - A new default log proxy (Log::Any::Proxy::Null) is used when there
        are no adapters configured (and so no place for logs to go). This
        proxy does no processing and is about 1000% percent faster on my
        laptop.
  
      [Fixed]
  
      - Suppress 'redundant argument' warnings if too many arguments are
        given to a log formatting string.

  1.037     2016-02-05 20:22:34-05:00 America/New_York (TRIAL RELEASE)
  
      [Fixed]
  
      - Fixed t/filescreen.t Unicode string tests to use a backwards
        compatible form.  Should fix tests before 5.16.
  
  1.035     2016-02-04 14:47:20-05:00 America/New_York (TRIAL RELEASE)
  
      [Changed]
  
      - The default formatter now replaces a code reference argument with
        the results of calling the code reference ONLY when it is the first
        argument (in place of a format string).  Code references in
        subsequent arguments (to sprintf) are not executed, as this would
        break backwards compatibility.
  
      [Documented]
  
      - Noted that repeatedly calling 'set' to set an adapter without calling
        'remove' or using the 'lexically' feature will leak memory.
  
  1.033     2016-02-03 10:32:57-05:00 America/New_York (TRIAL RELEASE)
  
      [Added]
  
      - The default formatter now expands code references.  If the first
        argument is a code reference, it is expanded and returned.  If an
        argument to "sprintf" style formatting is a code reference, it is
        expanded.
  
      [Changed]
  
      - The File adapter now opens files with the ":utf8" layer.  It also
        takes a 'binmode' attribute to change the default.
  
      [Fixed]
  
      - does_not_contain_ok test adapter function now gives proper
        diagnostic message
  
      - all diagnostic messages that output the captured log now
        correctly dump the log with pretty formatting
  
      [Documented]
  
      - documented the 'proxy_class' argument to `get_logger`
  
      [~Internal~]
  
      - Data::Dumper is loaded lazily, to reduce module load times
        for programs that don't need it.

  1.031     2015-03-26 06:08:17-04:00 America/New_York (TRIAL RELEASE)
  
      [Fixed]
  
      - Log::Any::Adapter::Test passed through all constructor arguments,
        which could be fatal when mocking adapters without all key-value
        pairs (like Log::Any::Adapter::File); now this only passes through
        the category and ignores other parameters when used as an
        adapter class override.
  
  1.03      2015-01-01 22:39:41-05:00 America/New_York
  
      [Changed]
  
      - Log::Any::Proxy concatenates arguments to basic logging functions
        with a space character before passing them to adapters as a single
        string.  This ensures consistency across adapters that handle
        multiple arguments differently.
  
  1.02      2014-12-28 07:06:49-05:00 America/New_York
  
      [Fixed]
  
      - Some adapters relied on Log::Any::Adapter::Util also loading
        Log::Any so this behavior has been restored.
  
  1.01      2014-12-26 22:25:13-05:00 America/New_York
  
      [Fixed]
  
      - 'numeric_level' was not exported properly from
        Log::Any::Adapter::Util
  
  1.00      2014-12-25 22:04:13-05:00 America/New_York
  
      [Added]
  
      - Logging now goes via a Log::Any::Proxy object instead of directly to
        an adapter. This allows easy customization of the message production.
  
      - File, Stdout, and Stderr adapters now support a minimum
        log level parameter.
  
      [Changed]
  
      - Removed dead code from Log::Any::Adapter::Base; particularly this
        was the formatting code, since this is now handled by
        Log::Any::Proxy.
  
      [Fixed]
  
      - File will flock the handle when writing (if flock is avaiable).
  
      - Won't die if adapters aren't loadable modules as long as they
        provide a constructor.  This allows using private adapters
        defined in another file.
  
      [Documented]
  
      - Revised docs for creating adapters
  
      - Fixed typos and improved docs for Log::Any::Adapter::Util; removed
        stub docs for modules that didn't need it.
  
      [Deprecated]
  
      - Deprecated some methods in Log::Any::Adapter::Util
  
      [Internal]
  
      - Merged Log-Any and Log-Any-Adapter distributions; reduces code
        duplication and ensures Log::Any and adapter framework stay in sync
  
      - Eliminates all non-core dependencies (as of Perl 5.8.1), including
        Capture::Tiny, Devel::GlobalDestruction and Guard
