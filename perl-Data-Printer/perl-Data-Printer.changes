      Bumping 0.35_01 to stable. Below is the (repeated) changelog,
      with the single addition of the 'scalar_quotes' patch.
  
      BACKWARDS-INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE
          - p()'s return value now defaults to 'pass'. Please see
            https://github.com/garu/Data-Printer/issues/16 for the
            full discussion. THIS WILL BREAK CODE RELYING ON p() TO
            RETURN A STRING. To fix your code, please set 'return_value'
            to 'dump' explicitly, or use the experimental np() function.
  
      NEW HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL FEATURE:
          - np(), a version of p() that always returns the string instead
            of printing it.
  
      NEW FEATURES:
          - Add 'escape_chars' to allow \x{...} printing for chars
            (patch by Mark Fowler)
          - 'scalar_quotes' let you specify the quote to use when,
            well, quoting (Ivan Bessarabov)
          - Class::Date support in the DateTime filter (Ivan Bessarabov)
  
      BUG FIXES:
          - fixed crash in esoteric classes (github issue #41, thanks
            Ivan Bessarabov for reporting)
          - removed support for Digest::Haval256, as it can't really be
            observed without damaging the original data. If future versions
            provide a clone() function, it can be added again.
          - Being extra loud when rc files fail to load (RT#89203, thanks
            Caleb Cushing for reporting).
          - Prevents PERL5OPT from interfering with deparse tests (github
            issue #55, thanks David Precious for reporting)
  
      OTHER:
          - more tests
          - new external filter indexed: PDL
