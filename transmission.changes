Tue Apr 16 10:10:21 UTC 2024 - Max Lin <mlin@suse.com>

- Build with gcc13 on Leap 15

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb 23 08:05:08 UTC 2024 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Fix build with recent cmake macro change (DOCDIR): do not install
  the documentation using cmake, as we already do so using %doc.
  Change if(INSTALL_DOC) to if(FALSE) in CMakeLists.txt. The more
  obvious option of passing -DINSTALL_DOC=OFF is ot viable, as that
  also disables installing the man pages.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb 14 22:12:57 UTC 2024 - Martin Schreiner <martin.schreiner@suse.com>

- Migrate from update-alternatives to libalternatives (bsc#1219107).

    sometimes malformed.

  + Fix use of metainfo display-name as a fallback name.
  + Updated torrent Peer ID generation to happen once per session,
    even for public torrents.
  + GTK client:
    - Fix 4.0.0 preferences dialog being too large for small
      displays.
    - Fix 4.0.0 regression of percents, speeds, sizes, etc, not
      being i18nized properly.
  + Daemon: Set the log level sooner at startup to ensure events
    aren't missed.
  + Fix 4.0.0 bug in the display of how much of a torrent has been
    downloaded.
  + Documentation improvements.
- Drop merged-upstream patch:
  9fc0e4ff6186e3aee3d3350e9f1b062aa6e161fe.patch

  + Added many performance improvements, and numerous bugfixes.
  + The entire codebase has been migrated from C to C++.
  + The remote control GUIs (transmission-qt and transmission-web)
    now use the RPC API "table" mode, resulting in smaller payloads
    / less bandwidth use.

  + New Features:
    - Support for using BitTorrent v2 and hybrid torrents.

      announce all public torrents.
    - Newly-added seeds can start immediately and verify pieces on

      (e.g. User-Agent and date created) when creating new
      torrents.
    - The Web client has been rewritten and now supports mobile
      use.
    - When creating new torrents, users can now specify the piece
      size.
    - IPv6 blocklists are now supported.
    - Dozens of other new features.
  + Fix small scrape/announce packet size that could trip SYN flood
    detection on some systems.
  + Remove the 1024 open files limit previously required by how
    libcurl was used.
  + Add configurable anti-brute force settings.

  longer supported.

  transmission-hybrid-torrent-length.patch, and
  transmission-3.00-openssl-3.patch.
- Refresh harden_transmission-daemon.service.patch patch with
  Quilt.
- Drop transmission-qt.desktop source file favoring the one
  provided by upstream.
- Add transmission.rpmlintrc file to filter the "file-not-in-%lang"
  warning, since we are excluding the English translations from the
  lang sub-packages and packaging them in the common sub-package
  instead.

Wed Oct 10 08:08:56 UTC 2018 - Marguerite Su <i@marguerite.su>

- fix boo#1111323 transmission-qt try to load translations from /usr/bin
  + upstream issue#736 recommends to use cmake instead of autotools
    because codes related to autotools are deprecated. Nowadays
    we manually install transmission-qt translations into /usr/
    share/qt5/ directory where is designed for official Qt project
    only, while cmake will install to the right location /usr/share/
    transmission/translations.
  + switch build time configuration from autotools to cmake
- refactored transmission-appdata.patch to cmake-oriented.
  + handle transmission-gtk.appdata.xml translations with
    intltool-merge which is used by upstream for desktop files
    in gtk/CMakeLists.txt
  + handle transmission-qt.appdata.xml installation in
    qt/CMakeLists.txt instead of in specfile, because anyway
    we binary patch the -gtk.appdata.xml.in, we'd better not
    binary patch one while add another one as Source. so the
    SOURCE4 is also dropped.
- add transmission-3rdparty-no-download.patch
  + transmission's cmake configuration will download and build
    some 3rd-party libraries that could not be found in system.
    we patch its ExternalProject_Add() method to avoid the download
    because there are already source codes for such 3rd-party
    libraries located in third-party directory. Also, our OBS
    build machine doesn't support downloading in the build VM.
- mark COPYING with %license tag instead of %doc tag
- add extras/{rpc-spec.txt,send-email-when-torrent-done.sh}
  as doc since upstream installs them as doc too
