%description
nftlb a user-space tool that builds a complete load balancer and
traffic distributor using nftables.

* Topologies supported: Destination NAT, Source NAT, Direct Server
  Return and Stateless DNAT. This enables the use of the load
  balancer in one-armed and two-armed network architectures.
* Support for both IPv4 and IPv6 families.
* Multilayer load balancer: DSR in layer 2, IP based load balancing
  with protocol agnostic at layer 3, and support of load balancing of
  UDP, TCP and SCTP at layer 4.
* Multiport support for ranges and lists of ports.
* Multiple virtual services (or farms) support.
* Schedulers available: weight, round robin, configurable hash (per
  IP, port, MAC or combination of them) and symmetric hash.
* Support of configurable persistence or client-backend affinity with
  a timeout (per IP, port, MAC or combination of them).
* Support of security policies per service: white and blacklists
  (from ingress), queuing to user space filter, filtering of bogus
  TCP frames, maximum number of established connections, limit TCP
  RST per second, limit new connections per second and more.
* Priority support per backend.
* Live management of virtual services and backends programmatically
  through a JSON API.
