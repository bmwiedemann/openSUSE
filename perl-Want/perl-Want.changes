      - perl 5.23.8 breaks the hack we were using to implement double_return.
  
      This patch from David Mitchell fixes it. See https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=112226

      > This stops the double_return() 'convert CXt_SUB to CXt_NULL' hack from working properly, as PL_comppad is no longer restored when transitioning from the inner to outer sub. The attached patch substitutes one evil hack for another: it keeps the CXt_SUB context stack entry, but sets its retop field to point to the return op again (rather than its caller) so that the return op gets called twice (with a bit of markstack hackery to ensure there are two marks for the two returns to pop).

      - Restore compatibility with certain older perl versions (5.10 and 5.12)
  
        It seems that “ATTRS: lvalue” doesn’t work with older perls, but that you can
        forward-declare the method in Perl code with the :lvalue attribute with the same
        effect.
  
        This version of Want is still broken with perl 5.8, for reasons I haven’t investigated.

      - There is a new experimental option in bleadperl under which one ought not to use
        the op_sibling field directly. Quoting from perlguts.pod:
        
        “ Starting in version 5.21.2, perls built with the experimental
          define C<-DPERL_OP_PARENT> add an extra boolean flag for each op,
          C<op_moresib>.  When not set, this indicates that this is the last op in an
          C<OpSIBLING> chain. This frees up the C<op_sibling> field on the last
          sibling to point back to the parent op. Under this build, that field is
          also renamed C<op_sibparent> to reflect its joint role. The macro
          C<OpSIBLING(o)> wraps this special behaviour, and always returns NULL on
          the last sibling.  With this build the C<op_parent(o)> function can be
          used to find the parent of any op. Thus for forward compatibility, you
          should always use the C<OpSIBLING(o)> macro rather than accessing
          C<op_sibling> directly. ”
       
        Thanks to Reini Urban for the patch.

      - Add support for the new OP_MULTIDEREF
        Perl has a new op, added as a performance optimisation in fedf30e1c349130b23648c022f5f3cb4ad7928f3,
        to represent a sequence of array/hash dereferences. This patch adds support for the new op.

    - Change tests to avoid the new warning 'Useless assignment to a temporary' added in 5.15.

    - Remove a test that was testing the behaviour of perl, rather than of this module,
      and was testing an aspect of perl’s behaviour that has changed (bf8fb5ebd) in
      in such a way that the test was failing with bleadperl.

    - Avoid leaking the RHS of an lnoreturn lvalue sub, thanks to Father Chrysostomos
