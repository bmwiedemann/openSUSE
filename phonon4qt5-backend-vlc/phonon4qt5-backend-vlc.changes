  * Localization has been fixed for the Qt 5 build.
- Add lang subpackage containing the translations

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 10 15:21:22 UTC 2019 - wbauer@tmo.at

- Update to 0.10.2:
  * libvlc's internal screensaver inhibitor is now explicitly
    disabled. Applications are expected to inhibit manually (from
    an API they always were; now this is actually correctly
    abstracted from libvlc's defaults). The built-in libvlc
    inhibition is not consistent with other backends' behavior and
    can in fact cause dbus time outs when attempting to uninhibit
    on player shutdown (e.g. applications getting stuck for 30
    seconds on quit).
  * CMake output for libvlc has been made more verbose to aid
    diagnostics when libvlc is not found, or not completely found
    anyway. Previously the verbose output was only generated on
    success scenarios, where it is distinctly less useful, now it
    is also generated when libvlc was not found.
- Run spec-cleaner

- Update to 0.10.1:

- Drop fix-build-with-vlc2.patch, merged upstream

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb 23 21:23:35 UTC 2018 - wbauer@tmo.at

- Update to 0.10.0:
  * Changes
    + Mimetype support list has been synced with latest VLC
  * Bug Fixes
    + The health of our users is very dear to us, so we've lowered
      the default volume to 75% to not blow their ears out in the
      event of failure or badly configured frontend software
    + Volume application has been revised and now applies less
      aggressively. This gives PulseAudio a change to apply/restore
      its own default volume.
    + Volume application and correct role forwarding into VLC
      finally make the PulseAudio notification volume apply
      properly to notifications issued via Phonon (VLC 3 only).
  * VLC 3.0 API Pickup
    + New player role is being used to set the output category on a
      PulseAudio level. This fixes a long-standing bug where VLC
      based audio would always be categorized as video.
    + Various deprecation porting.
- Add fix-build-with-vlc2.patch to make it compile with VLC 2.x

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Feb 18 16:44:20 UTC 2018 - wbauer@tmo.at

- Update to 0.9.1
  * Fix building against older Phonon versions
  * Prevent compilation errors by avoiding preprocessor macros that
    could conflict with VLC's own names (kde#364582)
  * Removed excess warnings from the OS X video widget
  * Introduced a workaround for a double-release bug in the OS X 
    video widget introduced in Qt 5.8.0.
- Call vlc-cache-gen without -f option in %post on Tumbleweed,
  that option apparently doesn't exist anymore in vlc 3.0

- Update to 0.8.2:
   * Fix compilation with Qt 5.2.0

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov  5 23:02:09 UTC 2014 - hrvoje.senjan@gmail.com

- Update to 0.8.1:
   * Code style improvements.
   * VLC 2.2 compatibility - VLC 2.2 changed the time when
     PulseAudio streams are constructed, rendering the Phonon
     PulseSupport non-functional as it injects stream-dependent
     properties through the environment which needs to happen close
     to stream creation to avoid timing issues. The changed stream
     creation time makes it impossible to provide high-level
     PulseAudio control while also allowing Phonon applications to
     construct multiple AudioOutputs in a very short time frame.
     To allow core functionality from working under these
     circumstances Phonon PulseSupport integration is disabled
     when built against VLC >= 2.2 leading to the following
     known regressions:
      Changing the volume through the PulseAudio stream itself
      is not propagated to Phonon AudioOutputs, meaning the
      application can not reflect volume changes done through
      other applications (e.g. a volume mixer).
      Changing the muteness through the PulseAudio stream is
      not propagated either.
      The PulseAudio media.role property (as well as derived
      properties) is always set to 'video' making all Phonon
      application use the video category for output device
      selection (e.g. as seen in the Phonon KCM).
   * Revised the logic used to come up with an icon name for
     libvlc. If the application has QApplication::windowIcon
     set with an QIcon constructed through QIcon::fromTheme(string)
     the actual icon name will be used.
     Otherwise the lower-case version of
     QCoreApplication::applicationName is used.
   * Setting the libvlc app id is now only dependent on
     QCoreApplication::applicationName being set (previously
     it was also dependent on QCoreApplication::applicationVersion).
     This change was made to accomodate the fact that most
     applications neglect to set a version.
