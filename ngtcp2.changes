- update to 1.2.0:
  * Remove sample_offset field from ngtcp2_ppe
  * wolfssl: Just use QUIC v1 transport parameter codepoint
  * Do not send STOP_SENDING if RESET_STREAM has been
    received
  * Return early when STOP_SENDING is received more than once
  * Do not send STOP_SENDING if RESET_STREAM has been
    received
  * Fix persistent congestion
  * ngtcp2_pkt_adjust_pkt_num: Take bytes rather than bits
  * Remove use of SSL_set_quic_transport_version
  * Switch interop client/server to wolfssl because OpenSSL
    1.1.1 has been EOLed and OpenSSL 3.x has the various
    performance issues due to its design decision.
    wolfssl has been chosen because it has the ability
    to specify chacha cipher suite and it is also relatively
    easy to build compared to GnuTLS.
  * Avoid detecting OpenSSL 3.2 as quictls
  * cmake: Require nghttp3 >= v1.0.0
