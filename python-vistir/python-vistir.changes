- version update to 0.4.0
- Fixed a bug which caused test failures due to generated paths on
  *nix based operating systems which were too long.
  `#65 <https://github.com/sarugaku/vistir/issues/65>`_  
- Fixed a bug which caused spinner output to sometimes attempt to
  double encode on python 2, resulting in failed output encoding.
  `#69 <https://github.com/sarugaku/vistir/issues/69>`_
- Fixed an issue where paths could sometimes fail to be fs-encoded
  properly when using backported ``NamedTemporaryFile`` instances.
  `#74 <https://github.com/sarugaku/vistir/issues/74>`_
