  # 2.0.2
  
  - Suppress the header override warning introduced in 2.0.1 if the value is the
    same. There's no conflict if the value is unchanged. (#578)

- updated to version 2.0.1

  # 2.0.1
  
  - Warn if auto-generated headers from the payload, such as Content-Type,
    override headers set by the user. This is usually not what the user wants to
    happen, and can be surprising. (#554)
  - Drop the old check for weak default TLS ciphers, and use the built-in Ruby
    defaults. Ruby versions from Oct. 2014 onward use sane defaults, so this is
    no longer needed. (#573)

Mon Jul  4 04:39:18 UTC 2016 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to version 2.0.0
 see installed history.md

  # 2.0.0
  
  This release is largely API compatible, but makes several breaking changes.
  
  - Drop support for Ruby 1.9
  - Allow mime-types as new as 3.x (requires ruby 2.0)
  - Respect Content-Type charset header provided by server. Previously,
    rest-client would not override the string encoding chosen by Net::HTTP. Now
    responses that specify a charset will yield a body string in that encoding.
    For example, `Content-Type: text/plain; charset=EUC-JP` will return a String
    encoded with `Encoding::EUC_JP`. (#361)
  - Change exceptions raised on request timeout. Instead of
    `RestClient::RequestTimeout` (which is still used for HTTP 408), network
    timeouts will now raise either `RestClient::Exceptions::ReadTimeout` or
    `RestClient::Exceptions::OpenTimeout`, both of which inherit from
    `RestClient::Exceptions::Timeout`. For backwards compatibility, this still
    inherits from `RestClient::RequestTimeout` so existing uses will still work.
    This may change in a future major release. These new timeout classes also
    make the original wrapped exception available as `#original_exception`.
  - Unify request exceptions under `RestClient::RequestFailed`, which still
    inherits from `ExceptionWithResponse`. Previously, HTTP 304, 401, and 404
    inherited directly from `ExceptionWithResponse` rather than from
    `RequestFailed`. Now _all_ HTTP status code exceptions inherit from both.
  - Rename the `:timeout` request option to `:read_timeout`. When `:timeout` is
    passed, now set both `:read_timeout` and `:open_timeout`.
  - Change default HTTP Accept header to `*/*`
  - Use a more descriptive User-Agent header by default
  - Drop RC4-MD5 from default cipher list
  - Only prepend http:// to URIs without a scheme
  - Fix some support for using IPv6 addresses in URLs (still affected by Ruby
    2.0+ bug https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/9129, with the fix expected to be
    backported to 2.0 and 2.1)
  - `Response` objects are now a subclass of `String` rather than a `String` that
    mixes in the response functionality. Most of the methods remain unchanged,
    but this makes it much easier to understand what is happening when you look
    at a RestClient response object. There are a few additional changes:
    - Response objects now implement `.inspect` to make this distinction clearer.
    - `Response#to_i` will now behave like `String#to_i` instead of returning the
      HTTP response code, which was very surprising behavior.
    - `Response#body` and `#to_s` will now return a true `String` object rather
      than self. Previously there was no easy way to get the true `String`
      response instead of the Frankenstein response string object with
      AbstractResponse mixed in.
    - Response objects no longer accept an extra request args hash, but instead
      access request args directly from the request object, which reduces
      confusion and duplication.
  - Handle multiple HTTP response headers with the same name (except for
    Set-Cookie, which is special) by joining the values with a comma space,
    compliant with RFC 7230
  - Rewrite cookie support to be much smarter and to use cookie jars consistently
    for requests, responses, and redirection in order to resolve long-standing
    complaints about the previously broken behavior: (#498)
    - The `:cookies` option may now be a Hash of Strings, an Array of
      HTTP::Cookie objects, or a full HTTP::CookieJar.
    - Add `RestClient::Request#cookie_jar` and reimplement `Request#cookies` to
      be a wrapper around the cookie jar.
    - Still support passing the `:cookies` option in the headers hash, but now
      raise ArgumentError if that option is also passed to `Request#initialize`.
    - Warn if both `:cookies` and a `Cookie` header are supplied.
    - Use the `Request#cookie_jar` as the basis for `Response#cookie_jar`,
      creating a copy of the jar and adding any newly received cookies.
    - When following redirection, also use this same strategy so that cookies
      from the original request are carried through in a standards-compliant way
      by the cookie jar.
  - Don't set basic auth header if explicit `Authorization` header is specified
  - Add `:proxy` option to requests, which can be used for thread-safe
    per-request proxy configuration, overriding `RestClient.proxy`
  - Allow overriding `ENV['http_proxy']` to disable proxies by setting
    `RestClient.proxy` to a falsey value. Previously there was no way in Ruby 2.x
    to turn off a proxy specified in the environment without changing `ENV`.
  - Add actual support for streaming request payloads. Previously rest-client
    would call `.to_s` even on RestClient::Payload::Streamed objects. Instead,
    treat any object that responds to `.read` as a streaming payload and pass it
    through to `.body_stream=` on the Net:HTTP object. This massively reduces the
    memory required for large file uploads.
  - Changes to redirection behavior: (#381, #484)
    - Remove `RestClient::MaxRedirectsReached` in favor of the normal
      `ExceptionWithResponse` subclasses. This makes the response accessible on
      the exception object as `.response`, making it possible for callers to tell
      what has actually happened when the redirect limit is reached.
    - When following HTTP redirection, store a list of each previous response on
      the response object as `.history`. This makes it possible to access the
      original response headers and body before the redirection was followed.
    - Follow redirection consistently, regardless of whether the HTTP method was
      passed as a symbol or string. Under the hood rest-client now normalizes the
      HTTP request method to a lowercase string.
  - Add `:before_execution_proc` option to `RestClient::Request`. This makes it
    possible to add procs like `RestClient.add_before_execution_proc` to a single
    request without global state.
  - Run tests on Travis's beta OS X support.
  - Make `Request#transmit` a private method, along with a few others.
  - Refactor URI parsing to happen earlier, in Request initialization.
  - Improve consistency and functionality of complex URL parameter handling:
    - When adding URL params, handle URLs that already contain params.
    - Add new convention for handling URL params containing deeply nested arrays
      and hashes, unify handling of null/empty values, and use the same code for
      GET and POST params. (#437)
    - Add the RestClient::ParamsArray class, a simple array-like container that
      can be used to pass multiple keys with same name or keys where the ordering
      is significant.
  - Add a few more exception classes for obscure HTTP status codes.
  - Multipart: use a much more robust multipart boundary with greater entropy.
  - Make `RestClient::Payload::Base#inspect` stop pretending to be a String.
  - Add `Request#redacted_uri` and `Request#redacted_url` to display the URI
    with any password redacted.
  
  # 2.0.0.rc1
  
  Changes in the release candidate that did not persist through the final 2.0.0
  release:
  - RestClient::Exceptions::Timeout was originally going to be a direct subclass
    of RestClient::Exception in the release candidate. This exception tree was
    made a subclass of RestClient::RequestTimeout prior to the final release.

Tue Mar 24 05:30:07 UTC 2015 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to version 1.8.0
 - Security: implement standards compliant cookie handling by adding a
   dependency on http-cookie. This breaks compatibility, but was necessary to
   address a session fixation / cookie disclosure vulnerability.
   (#369 / CVE-2015-1820)
 
   Previously, any Set-Cookie headers found in an HTTP 30x response would be
   sent to the redirection target, regardless of domain. Responses now expose a
   cookie jar and respect standards compliant domain / path flags in Set-Cookie
   headers.

    stated in the specification
  - added RestClient.add_before_execution_proc to hack the http
    request, like for oauth
  The response change may be breaking in rare cases.
