-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jul 24 09:46:26 CEST 2010 - meissner@suse.de

- updated to version 1.3:
  * Bugs in the MS-ZIP and Quantum decompressors have been fixed. This
    fixes two security vulnerabilites: a segfault when testing a specific
    Quantum archive, and an infinite loop when testing or extracting a
    badly-formed MSZIP archive.
  * MS-ZIP recovery has been improved. You will now get data from within
    a bad block, up to the point it turned bad.
- license changed to GPLv3

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 21 09:35:17 CEST 2006 - sndirsch@suse.de

- updated to version 1.2:
  * The "-t" archive integrity checking option has been added. This
    was requested by several users. cabextract can unpack cabinet
    files and give you MD5 checksums of the files inside, without 
    writing the unpacked files to disk.
  * Large files (more than 2 gigabytes) are now correctly searched
    for cabinet files.
  * A security vulnerability has been fixed. Files compressed with
    the Quantum method, using a window size less than 32768 bytes,
    could cause cabextract to write beyond the end of the window 
    and cause a segmentation fault. This fix also permits 
    cabextract to unpack this type of cabinet file (of which only
    one has been found in the wild) correctly.
  * The unnecessary GNU source mempcpy.c, which caused compilation
    failures on several systems, was removed.
  * An off-by-one error introduced in 1.1's UTF-8 decoder was
    fixed. Files with UTF-8 filenames can now be extracted. The 
    UTF-8 decoder was also upgraded to support the latest
    Unicode characer maps.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct 26 04:57:24 CEST 2004 - sndirsch@suse.de

- updated to version 1.1
  * A security vulnerability has been fixed. If the files within a 
  cabinet file include "../" in their filenames, this will be
  changed to "xx/", so cabinets cannot access the parent directory 
  of where you want to extract them. (Bug #47537)
  * cabextract should now compile cleanly on AIX and Cygwin

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 15 09:42:13 CET 2004 - sndirsch@suse.de

- updated to version 1.0

  Changes since 0.6:

  * The cabextract source has been refactored and rewritten into a
  portable, extensible, robust library called libmspack. Now
  cabextract is just a UNIX-specialised command line application using
  the OS-agnostic libmspack CAB decompressor. Any developers who were
  considering using cabextract in their own software should now look
  at libmspack first.

  * Many bugs in the decompressers were squashed after
  refactoring. More than three gigabytes of real CAB files from the
  wild were used in testing. Corrupt cabinets that crashed cabextract
  0.6 are now correctly reported as corrupt, without crashing.

  * cabextract now alerts you if you try and use it to unpack
  InstallShield cabinet files. This is the number one FAQ saver.

  * cabextract no longer gets "/" and "\" mixed up.

  * cabextract now ignores cabinet files listed on the command line
  that have already been used as part of a multi-part set. You can now
  type cabextract *.cab on a big multi-part set, cabextract will not
  extract all the files several times over.

  * cabextract now lists files with the same filenames it would use if
  it were extracting them. This includes always showing UNIX directory
  separators in the listing.

  * cabextract now correctly lowercases cabinet files with Unicode
  filenames.

  * cabextract has the new --filter, --single and --pipe options.

  * The cabextract package now includes experimental wince_info and
  wince_rename scripts.

  * The definition of Microsoft cabinet files in doc/magic has been
  fixed, and a definition of Windows CE install cabinet header files
  has also been added.
