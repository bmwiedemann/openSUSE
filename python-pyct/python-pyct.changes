- Update to 0.4.6
  * Tests were added to make sure the the commands in pyct.cmd are well documented
  * The --use-test-data flag was added to fetch-data and examples to allow the use of smaller datasets in regular examples. To use this feature place a smaller dataset with the same name in your project's examples/data/.data_stubs/. See pyviz/pyviz#128 for first use of this feature.
  * clean-data was added to delete small test data files masquerading as real ones.
